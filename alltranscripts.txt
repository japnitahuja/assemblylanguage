Music thank you Applause Music thank you are you happy no I feel sick after you started this big old fight I feel sick to my A A stomach you I d like to take the company card and go get a pregnancy test you re pregnant no is that how you re announcing that you re pregnant to me no the way I ve been craving canned fish and the way that you make me sick I thought this was gon na be like nice and relaxed because I spoke to Lizzy yesterday and she s like have you ever taken a weekend off that s what I did this weekend and I am so happy I was so happy and now it s the Monday it s Monday so it s like that Joy s gone well don t bring that energy to me this is a fun job do you know what I m saying yeah you re being nasty I just I sorry that like my cover is so important this is big right this isn t what it normally is you got Shane s mic like Shane will not podcast without that mic what s up with that Shane I don t know this is crazy okay do you wan na like what do I do do I just keep it on yes you have to keep it on it s the popper thing the popper I m not an audio are you trying to do poppers it s A A A M on a Monday isn t that a gay thing yeah it is gay it seems super gay that you want to do that super gay that you tried to get me to do poppers to open this butthole up or is it super straight is that what it does and like relaxes the butt muscles to make something bigger go in easier you tell me have you done poppers no but now I m considering Chris have you done poppers Chris I have not I m terrified of drugs I don t do drugs are they like are they drugs um aren t they kind of Okay Google two things are poppers trucks yeah what are they utilized for and maybe this morning like these people on the internet are so dumb are poppers drugs do they loosen your butthole you know Lindsay walks into my house and she s like these people on this podcast didn t know anything about anything I m not I kept it vague I said I was hating on people on the internet and I said you re specifying it to a podcast everyone in their A A mom has a podcast literally I wouldn t be surprised if our moms have a problem poppers are drugs uh they re an inhalant drug um and they the products cause blood vessel dilation and muscle relaxation and are used for sexual enhancement so it does listen to butthole and all this time I was super annoyed when I had grinder hookups that would be like hold on got ta do my poppers damn it was awful like so you re it because it just felt to me like you know the P like if you have friends that have to get drunk to hang out or smoke pot to eat with you like if we re going to breakfast and they have to like you have to sit and wait for them to smoke a bowl before we can eat breakfast it felt the same to me it s like you can t have sex without the popper yeah I get you that s the other thing that s been bothering me about some of these podcasts all these kids are talking about their social anxiety and how they need to get A A up to do anything and then they have a podcast where they re all blacked out drunk and nobody says anything so now you re exposing yourself after getting mad at me she s gon na go deeper down the rabbit hole you ve already exposed no okay it s all podcasts but your whole thing was like talking about how these people didn t know anything on the podcast and I was like Lizzy have you ever tuned into our podcast like we can t we can t we know nothing as well the difference is we re sober so there s no excuse for our stupidity for yourself babies hello you guys welcome back to another episode of the soap I m Ryland Adams of course joined by Lizzie Gordon hello hello where do we go from there where do we go from here okay Joseph I saw cocaine bear did I ruin the through line yeah you always do okay we ll rewind Music um have you seen cocaine bear Chris yes what was your Vibe um My Vibe was O Shea Jackson Jr is very attractive did you like laugh at all no I mean I did it wasn t as funny or crazy as I wanted it to be it wasn t funny I like sat there and my main Vibe was like I could leave right now and I hated that I thought that way because I want to love Elizabeth Banks but I like the whole time I was like I could leave and Joe was like dead ass asleep dead ass asleep snoring like an old A A man and I was just that that made me laugh but I was like baby was I snoring look at the people next to you hear the snoring I don t think there s anyone there it was A A noon on a Tuesday that s the time to go to a movie that s when I go it s only five dollars at AMC I hit up that new Topanga theater Chris that AMC in the Topanga Mall yeah oh my gosh it is gorgeous but I do have a complaint about the seats they don t recline far enough oh I actually agree like I was like this is the most beautiful theater I ve ever been in it must have cost millions and millions of dollars to create but then like with my back issue which I m not gon na talk about but it like didn t recline enough so I think it like put me into a regression because I was like stuck between like all the way up and all the way down yeah and I was like what the A A but I saw scream I Saw Scream by myself I it s also sunscreen did you have a marathon leading up to like you had planned Chris I wanted to end up not having time but I rewatched the first one and that s it that s all I have time for did you go by yourself no okay I went by myself like I asked Ryland if he wanted to go with me and he said eat your own ass nasty loser A A I m going with my A A friends and you re not one of them and I was like okay no if there s ever a date I have to go to with Shane it s going to the Scream movie and he bought tickets for opening night months and months ago so really my beef s with Shane I thought it was great I had a great time I was to be honest severely disappointed spoilers ahead yeah we re gon na spoil this movie we re gon na spoil this movie people clicking out of our podcast don t click out but just go forward we ll put a little time stamp and we ll tell you when to go people do this all the time okay fine spoilers spoiler alert I knew who it was the moment Quinn was like my brother s dead I was like okay so it s Richie s A A sister and and then her dad s the police chief it s like and he s in on it and like even when they took us to The Killers and I was like well obviously her dad could have access to all of this evidence because he s a police officer I think for a second it might have been Hayden no not for one second I think it was Hayden I also felt like why resuscitate that character and you paid in a job let her live yeah but like they could have given Hayden like a the this character was weak and the movie would have survived without her which makes it like an annoying addition do you know what I mean like when there s characters just thrown in like the third brother like I don t give a A A about Ethan bro it s not like I got wet over the fact that this is there s three killers oh my God I thought it was much better than the first iteration of this new round of Scream movies I was much more entertained like yes maybe it was more obvious who the killers were but I thought the shots were good I liked more of the interaction I don t think it s as fast moving as the previous like original Scream movies like I all the reviews are like it s crazy it s back to back action and like there is a lot of action but there s still like a lot of emotional we re sitting and being emotional I feel like completely different than what you just said I thought like the direction was weak as A A and in the first reboot of this whole season like uh franchise the the direction of it was so specifically nuanced that some of the camera movement was a joke in and of itself that made me laugh and in this one it felt like everything was kind of rushed and not really well choreographed the fights felt poorly choreographed and the direction showed that to me like the scene where oh my God the A A fight sequence in Courtney Cox s apartment was a sick joke I loved it when the when when the two kids are uh when the sisters are running to get into the cop guy s car he s just standing out there like no wait like don t get in that car like they re moving like this fast and he s like don t take my car like he s like stuck in jello like all of it all of the choreography felt whack to me and even in just simple exchanges like that all of it was just like what the A A twins just getting held he s beefy as A A and he s being held by like the scrawny version and the A A little sister and he s just like run okay Chris what did you think stupid I also have one more hot take on it I feel like these remake episode These remake versions of the movies are more of like a stab film than a scream film and I was talking to Shane about this because I also knew that it was the sister and the dad because I was like oh this is following the set the original second Scream movies formula which is it s the mother and a Psycho film student of the original Killers right so it s all in the family but I did think I think that there s an interesting like pattern now going on where it s like these reboot films are sort of stab versions of the original scream Christopher I loved it I liked it too I thought it was an enjoy like without like critiquing like so in the nitty gritty like as an audience member I enjoyed sitting down and I enjoyed the ride like I enjoyed myself which is I think the goal when you re going to see a movie I saw it at a packed theater in Burbank with my boyfriend and my one of my best friends and the whole theater was clapping and we looked oh God don t get me started on going to a movie theater I couldn t be more annoyed by moviegoers I like I like the camaraderie of a crowd that s all excited for the film yeah I do too but it was like there was a a girl behind me screaming like like not like scared screaming like screaming her opinions then there was the guy next to me like overlapping at everything that didn t need to be laughed at yeah I m like can you guys just shut the A A up like if there s a good moment I agree it s like fun yeah to experience it together but then it s like the other side of us like eating loud the whole time and you re just like this is why we want to watch things at home for things that are even made for movie theaters but I love that I don t know I I like the change of scenery I like the I thought it was very fun I was never bored I don t know I had a really good time I would be excited if they sort of brought it back to the original the original like core like foundation of the film which is this is sort of like a parody of this type of movie and I think it would be really cool if it could get back to those sort of roots but now it s so deeply ingrained in its own mythology and it s weird need for these obscene twists and turns that it s like predictable right they lucked out with having Jenna Ortega become a huge star they lucked out with Jenna Ortega being hugely talented oh my God she is so good I believe so good like we left and that was my first thing I told Shane is like I believe her in everything like yeah I didn t give a A A about Wednesday I love Jenna Ortega and I have a theory that nobody would like the show Wednesday if Jenna Ortega was not in it I couldn t I tried but it s just not for me I watched as many episodes as I did because of Jenna Ortega and after the fact I m just like I don t give a A A about this A A she s so so so good yeah and like from Wednesday she did become this like overnight star even though she s been working since she was a child but it is crazy that now she like scream has her in this franchise before that yeah they re so lucky and they have uh the biggest opening weekend they ve ever had for a Scream movie yeah they ll be a third yep and then hopefully they ll change I also think it s wild that A A Dawson from Dawson s Creek who won wanted to be like a filmmaker is now writing the Scream movies doesn t that seem crazy he is yeah James Vander Beek right I thought it was the guy that died no no look it up look up the screenplay writer look it up Christopher I like it I m looking uh uh James Van Derby Oh weird why are you being so mean why are you being mean well because I didn t I thought it was the people that made ready or not those are the directors I thought he wrote and directed it I think that there s a few people who worked on the writing of it but I know that James has been credited for the past two as a writer okay but I also think it s so funny like Dawson s ambition was to be a filmmaker and now Dawson s writing the Scream movies which were like huge movies when Dawson s Creek was out right meta I ll Circle back to him later okay people need to say no oh yeah I think um this is not about scream but another hot take is I feel like our generation has turned into ghosters where they need to say no and it s okay to say no and it s A A rude to ghost oh so you re saying don t ghost I m saying don t ghost I m saying if somebody asks you to do something and you do not want to do it say I can not do it respond grow the A A up say no so annoying A A out here just being like I m just not gon na respond so what happened to you I ve just noticed like a few times I ve talked to people about doing things and they re like oh yeah you don t mean that don t say it don t say yeah because that s a green light to go A A and I do A A so if you say yeah to me I m gon na start working on something and if you don t mean yeah don t A A say it say no and so I like I ve just been thinking about a few projects that I ve started over the like the past couple of weeks or years or whatever and people are like oh yeah absolutely oh yeah and they don t mean it yeah I guess it does take that s A A rude for you to be in a certain place in your own personal growth to be able to say no so or like that sounds like so much fun I m unavailable I know but they re saying no to somebody also comes with feeling like you re hurting somebody s feelings I m more hurt when you say oh yeah and then you stop responding I will kill these people we need a happy story for you you re mad about screaming you re mad about this we need you to like take a deep no and look at the rest of this document it s A A bad James Vanderbilt not an actor are you sure look it up I did after you were so crazy positive because he goes on ready to Nellis all the time see it is the guy from ready or not I love being right wait well he acted uncredited and ready or not but the directors did not write it because I remember the directors of ready or not are the guys that took on screen right because Shane and I were very excited because we liked ready or not a lot we are we sure though get me a picture I think his name is Vander built and I think it s really close well will you Google the writer because I ve Loved this for years yeah and will you Google image the writer yeah and then are you are you gon na give me like a formal apology because it was really nasty the way that you I m so sorry you re like okay I m so sorry thank you honestly I m so sorry okay no let s not oh wow he s hideous that could never be fodder for A A Teenage Dream fantasy at least you re big enough to own up to your mistakes well I was also saying Van Der Beek right Vanderbilt yeah are they different names yeah because other James is also a screenplay writer because he s been on The Brady cinellas podcast a multitude of times which is why it was fine for my brain to make that connection and the names are so close damn I m devastated I just feel great because it was real aggressive I m about to take my apology back because you re a floating ass A A I m so sorry so sorry that I don t feel as sorry as I once did today s podcast is sponsored by ZocDoc and there s nothing worse than going to a

new steakhouse by the creators of mastros which is like we love going Shane proposed to mastros in Malibu and it s called stake so we had a little date night we lived it up awesome I had my first drink in days I was days sober only because I was on my health Journey which then A A backfired on me because of my back yeah can you imagine trying to like be all fit and healthy yeah and then it s like you re rewarded with getting injured yeah okay great for me I m sorry steak was great what is it just steak and sides well remember we still have to go to State uh STK I can only bake for so yeah and then ghost me I ve I follow through on things then why have I not been to steak okay that s fine now I m warm too oh I got an annoying email who what is it should we read it it s read the email what s it about well we re in the process which is really dark of making well Shane already has his will I m trying to make my will I don t think it s dark I think it s people often don t do these like housekeeping things and then they re dead and there s no one left to do these housekeeping things so I think it s important no matter what age you are just to get your A A fares in order I don t feel comfortable talking about it because we re flying soon and like so where this connects is like I just I m too superstitious for this uh yeah let s not manifest anything on this podcast but we can definitely talk about how my fake net worth dropped what I used to have a fake net worth of three million dollars wow you re rich I know and I m like I was like oh I love this for me like I hope my enemies like Google it and think like oh damn you know they don t know they don t know the truth and then I this like came up when I was at my friend Kate s baby s birthday this weekend and I was like oh yeah like my fake net worth is three million dollars and they like Googled it and it s not anymore what is it now like oh my gosh do you think like being more visible on this podcast they re like there s no way yeah I do so this is gon na be my last time on the set they were like when you were go ahead and bring Chris s ass up into this seat let s watch his neck work this fake net worth dropped I was such a weird slap in the face too because none of it s true or real and it like I would be so blessed to be worth million or and I m upset about it I bet your Wiki feet score dropped at the same time oh it s bend down nobody gives a A A about my Wiki fee anymore since we went to like a single frame no one sees my feet on the internet oh it s hard for you yeah this whole podcast is really like rooting a lot of stuff for me publicly speaking okay so you canceled your like weekend getaway and San Diego well Joe and I were gon na go and stay at an Airbnb for the weekend to go to my friend Kate s baby s birthday okay and then it was all rainy and A A so I was like well it s not why would we spend the money if we can t do anything like it was Goofy this weather is nuts here yeah so I went by myself I drove in for the day and drove out at the night you re doing a lot by yourself lately ain t that the truth and you have so many friends crazy wait so many friends to just say yeah why were there babies where you were because it was a A A baby s birthday party all those guys don t know that many babies yeah all the women all of my friends friends have kids and they re all little girls so there was like A A little girls there from like oldest was three years old and they re so A A cute and really wild and so does it honestly make you more want to have kids or less want to have kids I think that s a really interesting question don t we keep asking questions like keeping inquisitive so I have been having a lot of anxiety about it where it s like I have some friends who have kids and they re like oh Liz I got home and I thought what the A A have I done and I m like oh A A and then like I just keep hearing that echoed by more and more people like oh A A oh A A oh A A like I like love my baby but like sometimes I don t like my baby and I m just like oh A A and it s like I ve been around a lot of these babies and like honestly I love all of them like scream crying is awful scream crying is awful sleep training is awful feeding them is awful like breastfeeding is awful you get physically emotional when your milk lets down like in a psychotic way that you can t control because it s all hormonal from a time when women needed to be told by nature to feed their babies so that they wouldn t like it s crazy I m definitely gon na have postpartum rage and depression and anxiety and OCD like all of these things go with having a baby and then after it s a baby it s a A A toddler and that to me is a massive A A nightmare but I was also sitting in the midst of this I don t think you ve been around it no I mean yes when s the last time you spent an hour with a toddler tell me not for a minute right so as I had three dangling from my neck this weekend pulling my A A hair and screaming in every corner of the house I literally thought to myself like wow maybe I don t want this well yeah and then another mom was like oh yeah my life s over my life s absolutely over and then another mom has her daughter like yanking on her like she has any time I try to have a conversation it s like it could be she can be totally content I have set her up with something like she has everything that she needs in the world and she just A A needs me she just A A needs me the second I try to have a conversation about anything that s not her and it s like I m seeing these people and I m and like I get back to my friend s house after it was all said and done and I was like bro like should I not do this I m having a glass of fake red wine and her husband was like no you should absolutely do it he s like I love being a father so A A much and when people say your life is over it s like if you really think about it it was changing anyway was over yeah your life is your life s not over your life evolves he s like and you can still he s like I was so A A scared because everyone told me my life was over I would get like my mother in law was sending me articles about how like people who used to do the things that I m passionate about gave up on those passions and like all these things like he s like I m that scared the A A out of me I don t want to give up but I m passionate I guess I m delusional and thinking like my life s going to get better in all aspects from having children I think that is toxic positivity because you re putting a lot of pressure on a human to make your you know what I mean it s not on them I m saying because of the demand of more responsibility for me because I have uh less time to fixate on things that I don t need to be fixating on because I have to keep this thing alive um I just I feel like it would make me a better rounded person not dependent on how they re interacting or being with me interesting like you think your baby will run you down so you re you don t get crazy about something and also bring me uh fulfillment in oh yeah like in all aspects I think yeah that s one that s an interesting way to look at a fuller life like yeah I well that s what I think too so and that s what they were saying they re like do you really want to keep going on bar crawls every weekend do you really want to stay locked in this chapter of your life as opposed to like progressing and expanding and watching what the evolution of it all is and I was like Oh no you re right like I do want that like my I have fantasies that I laugh at as if it s a picture I ve already seen of Joe and our child being A A stupid like so I think the answer is yes I still want it and while I was sitting there I was like oh this is so fun and then the moms were like I A A hate it here and I was like what and then it s also like but I don t drink anyway I won t miss the drinking yeah yeah so the answer is yeah I still want a kid all right I m excited for us yeah me too I also think you should spend some time with the toddler just so your shit s can t change anything no it won t but it ll be like this is what s coming all right it s like instead of going directly into like scuba diving you practice in a pool first you know what I mean so when it comes you re not just like well maybe some of my friends would start having kids hello you re going before me though I know okay why do you care more about what oh I care more about Alex Earl s spring break in Nashville than I give a A A about than Oscars Who s Alex Earl oh my God we re just gon na move on you also wrote Alice Earl so I don t even know if you know who you re talking about I do but it s like I m writing with it highlighted in Black because I don t know how to change it so to be fair everything I wrote I know I didn t see this document like God bless Lizzy she does help prepare this document and she produces a lot of this show but then I like go to open it to organize it because it s never organized so I looked at it yesterday and it s like all black text with black highlighter so it s like big black boxes and I don t know how I did it and it s then it s like I can t undo it there s Hot Topics in top of show everything else is like highlighted it s like it looks like a redacted CIA document and it s like I so appreciate like putting in the hard work but then it takes me minutes to like arrange it so that we can actually how do you think I feel writing a whole document I can t see stupid open your A A computer and look at it we re not gon na open my computer while I m I do this in bed every morning okay uh I couldn t stop I like yeah for some reason I couldn t care about the Oscars this year no I just kept watching million dollar listing LA which is something I just discovered Seasons later yeah I just like honestly it was like and I went and I recorded it because I was like oh I ll scroll through it and when I see like a face of somebody I like I ll stop didn t even do that right because he hates Jamie Lee Curtis I don t hate Jamie Lee Curtis I think then let s have her on the bottom great go for it I ll go get it she won right yeah she won for best supporting actress major emotions I ve still never seen everything everywhere all at once I I took a big nap in the middle of it and came back at the end and was found it riveting and was super moved and have never turned it back on to start it all I know is people say it s crazy how everything and nothing matters some say it s crazy so is that the message of the movie am I good yeah you did it okay something about bagels and spaghetti I want an Oscar fingers I want an Oscar you want an awesome I did it play the thing I know it I want to thank Dawson from Dawson s Creek who worked tirelessly in high school so that one day he could write scream only to have the credit revoked by Ryland Adams on the set all right let s get to some hot topics it s crazy that you manifested James Van Der Beek for me because that s where we re going right now why what do you do well let s get to this first story and I ll Circle well then that s not where we re going right now it is where we re going right now at all all roads lead to James okay I can call him by his name it s Dawson okay does Dawson have a first first name Boris is named Dawson Dawson you know Shane would know right his Dawson Creek s biggest fan I know can you get see and I was texting with Shane about this and I said that and Shane didn t correct me he just didn t want to get into what I had to get into with you but I wouldn t have questioned him the way I questioned you do you know what I m saying right because he has like and that proves my point about when you were talking about the podcast hosts that don t know much I was like us yeah I knew that now that I see it you did okay so did you watch the Hugh Grant interview I went back and watched it after you told me about it the only thing I saw from what is it I was gon na say the Olympics from the Oscars was Hugh Grant s on the red carpet getting interviewed by Ashley Graham and he could be he couldn t be less interested my heart was like literally breaking for her oh it was awful he was so it was like he was mad at her personally she s like who are you wearing he s like I don t know A A well he s so she started and I get like her question was what are you most excited to see and it s like yes so then she like realizes it wasn t a specific enough question so she tries to recover and she s like I mean you know a lot of the people nominated is there anyone that you re rooting for she really tried to specify because no no and then she goes well you you know you were in a big movie this year Glass Onion he s like I was in it for three seconds and then he goes she goes well what are you wearing and he s like I don t know just my suit yeah and I was like I understand I think like had a comedian been in Ashley s role the comedian could have been like hey like yeah would have handled it differently and they could have vibed back and forth but it s not like this is a comedy red carpet it s ABC before the Oscars the Oscars is a very formal event you know you re walking the red carpet and I know everyone has bad days like celebrities are people and they have bad days but it s like if you re walking the Oscars red carpet and the host isn t giving you what you need it s also a very hard job for that host to have okay there s a potential of a hundred celebrities coming through you need to prepare for all of them well they re also wearing an earpiece and there s a bunch of people in a van somewhere being like ask them about his weiner Music but I just you like give the woman a break and it s like he just kept shutting her down so I like kept like my heart kept breaking because I ve been in this position so many times did you watch it at the end where he s handed the A A microphone back okay at the end she s like okay well I guess that s it he s like like rolls his eyes and like does a whole little string and then just sort of like slangs the A A microphone back and he like walks away and I think there was a part of him that thought he was being funny in addition to kind of being like it was like he s over it he was over it but I think he just like like I don t know it was just a bad scenario gone worse yeah it was so cringy so awful to watch and it just reminded me I did like a tasker s event like what is that it s like Tosca it sounds like it s like sexy it s it s leading up to the Oscars about things that weren t nominated for Oscars but it s like I don t know it s like a joke award show thing why does it make me feel like tossers okay but James Van Der Beek walked down this red carpet I had never seen Dawson s Creek there s a hundred celebrities and whoever stops I m just and I don t I m not working for this fancy outlet that has like an earpiece to be like this is what he s in this is what he s done oh and you didn t know he is and so I didn t know who he was and so I just start asking generic questions trying to find something to build on right but he was doing the same thing Hugh Grant was doing which was just like shutting down or giving one answer words and then it s like how can I create a conversation with you from one word when you clearly know I don t know even though you re a huge deal and I understand that s annoying for the celebrity like it s frustrating I would have said to him what what s it like being Dawson who wanted to be a filmmaker now in getting to write the scream franchise films like that s crazy right and he would have done the same thing he did to me and then he would be like I didn t write those I m like yes you did and in my eyes I was like oh he was so mean to me but it s like no I was ill informed and I didn t I wasn t prepared I didn t know he wasn t being mean it was probably like a hit to him as well but me if I were a celebrity going on a red carpet I would assume just that like as an Entertainer I m gon na entertain if the host is doing a bad job it s my job to like make us both look great yeah you know what I mean yeah and so I know not everyone has the energy for that all the time do you remember what you said to him I tried watching it again with Shane like years later but it was like cringe level and I just had to like I remember him I no I can t I can t go back to that not not without a popper that s so funny wait what is Dawson s real name James Van Der Beek uh built I think it s beak do we just kill the other one I think we just have to get rid of the other one okay Courtney Cox said she didn t realize she looked a little off when she went overboard with facial fillers and admitted that she messed up a lot crazy I also was looking at her and screaming thinking the facelift was a bit too far well she s dissolved the filler and that s what she said in after a lot of public scrutiny she revealed that she had her fillers dissolved after realizing she didn t quote look right and she was saying and talking about the evolution of this just as like an actress in Hollywood you like want to preserve how you re looking and she said the next thing you know you re layered and layered and layered and you have no idea because it s a gradual thing until you go oh A A that doesn t look right and in pictures it s even worse than real life yeah and I ve definitely noticed that like I see a lot of people that are desperate to cling to a certain thing and I think we need to like normalize aging there was also an interesting like uh study of Kim Kardashian s doctored photos and the photos that fans take that aren t photoshopped and if Kim hadn t been photoshopping the images on Instagram for so heavily for so long we could watch her age in a graceful way but now when we see an image that a fan posts and it looks nothing like the woman she projects herself to be we re all like oh my God but it s like if it were just a more natural normal human thing it would be beautiful are we not seeing her age on the Kardashians like how can she alter video um well it s like you know heavy makeup Bright Lights like all of those help yeah all those things help and then it s also like a filter on a camera there s a camera filter that you can put in front of a lens that s called like the A A black magic or like Hollywood magic filter and you can up the A A ante on that A A and it s like color correct and you can do a lot of things I I understand how she got to where she got like yeah every business person makes decisions based on their business she s making decisions about her looks because her looks are her business so from one degree I like understand how she got there but it does suck and it yeah I just think there s so much more longevity to a natural face like it s harder to book Courtney Cox for something because not every woman has that level of work done so it s not a normal looking face it s like France Francis mcdormitt works all the time because she looks like a person and that s why like I have crow s feet and I don t love them it s like you can win an Academy Award one day I m not going to alter them the same reason I m not gon na alter my teeth just because like somebody in Hollywood s like well you need your teeth fixed or the dentist is like oh you need your teeth fixed I m like well no that s something that s a defining characteristic of me and if you re an actor like you also want those nuanced things about your body that are real because you re portraying a character that you want people to relate to yeah and nobody can relate to I guess if you re a reality star maybe it s different because you re selling yourself but I m also a fan of baby bow talks but this also like looks right so there s different beauty standards for everything that you do there s like the influencer the Instagram influencer who has the huge A A fake lips the crazy BBL like the titties and everything like that s one person s Beauty standard but there s like a beauty scene for like everyone you know hmm James Van Der Beek versus James Vanderbilt right but who is who is what I m asking James Van Der Beek is Dawson ah got it okay Vander Beek yes okay um card elevane Cara Delevingne checked into rehab amid an existential crisis turns out last year when they got all those pictures of her being erratic and weird with no shoes on after burning man she really was struggling good for her what I really appreciate about this art did you read it I watched uh I went straight to the video version Oh what s the video version her actual interview Vogue did I don t know if they included everything that s in the magazine but it s like a seven minute sit down that s really beautifully done uh with a Vogue editor and Cara being very honest and vulnerable I mean that s something I like about Cara she s a no nonsense A A and she s like I m going to tell it how I tell it and what I really liked about what I read I don t know if it s from the Vogue thing so if it s something you haven t heard yet I m sorry but it s um the what I read were these Snippets of her saying like when I was younger and I would go through these phases of emotional discomfort or binge using substances I thought that there was an easy fix for it I thought I could go away for a weekend and come back cured I thought I could take a pill I thought I could talk to a therapist one day and all of a sudden I wouldn t have this problem and what I really appreciate about her emotional evolution is she s like I realize now that there is no cure for what I have it is a daily reprieve I have to work on this for the rest of my life and there and that is the answer to it and that s not a nightmare or a bummer it s like a blessing to come to that realization these are some of the things that I pulled from the interview as well she said can t run from things in your life because they ll always catch up to you and she said she does prefer the term healing over recovering because she said it does get better but you don t really recover you heal yeah um another point I thought was interesting is she said something along the lines of like they ll use her to be an advocate because she was very vocal about mental health in general and she said but then when the script flips and I was going through something uh they say bye and they don t want to deal with it they being like Brands and brands people she s working with I m assuming movies that she was slated to do it s just interesting because she s like when I m talking about my mental health is like go get yours checked everything s good they want that for me but then when I m struggling they want nothing yeah they re like barrier in the background that s just the business that we re in yeah and so I m glad that she has seemingly found her footing she looks wonderful she showed up at the Oscar I did see yeah a picture from her at the Oscars last night and I was like oh my gosh she looks incredible yeah what I ve noticed is when a human being is out of sorts internally and emotionally it s like like their insides are just a bunch of molecules or whatever just moving a little bit too fast and it s like it s an uncomfortable thing to be around but when a person is settled into their spirit and like acting out of love and kindness in all aspects of their life like there s like a calm that runs through their body and it s nice to be around them yeah and I see that in her now like she s not doing the weird erotic like I m gon na throw your sleeves up making the stallion and she said it took herself seeing her being erratic in those paparazzi photos and videos that was really a breaking point for her because she said I did have interventions of sorts and they didn t work or click for me and she was like I have this big beautiful life but that didn t match how I was feeling on the inside she s like I m grateful for everything that I have but it just didn t line up oh that s is that your phone um oh no it s okay so I just good for her yeah I also think that it s really important to remember that addiction doesn t give a A A who you are doesn t give a A A what your bank account looks like where you came from who your parents are what your friends do what you do it will come and it will ravage you and if you don t reckon with it there are only a few Opera like a few possibilities for the way the trajectory of your life and it s you know death institutionalization or incarceration right so deal with it don t run from it because it will always catch up to you thanks Cara thanks Cara getting spiritually right is much better than going to jail or dying she did say she also had her first sober Christmas in New Year s and it was the best she s ever had I mean in a long time yeah I mean like honestly I think about it all the time because I was a person who like when I lost alcohol I A A mourned it like a dead lover I was like I have you get to look at my mouth gone you don t even love it like I did you A A losers something that s so social and it s the only I saw somebody well it s more than it s social it s my that was my lover but it is interesting too with alcohol like uh I think Kyle Richards from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills she s uh she s not drinking right now and like that s what the show is like they drink get drunk and get in fights and she was like it s interesting she posted it like a story being like alcohol is the only like drug that people question you for not using yeah because it is something that like you do when you gather and even like at Christmas or part it s just I really it my heart goes out to like even you who like has to I mean you re farther along in your journey than maybe a lot of people struggling but it has to be very hard yeah I but the longer you stay the easier it becomes to appreciate your sobriety more because the love and like stability I have in my heart and like the answers that I have for my problems today are so much better like like I used to feel like a warm hug from alcohol and now when I think about it I feel like it s it was my abuser and like what used to feel really safe and comforting that I like literally I cried over the loss of alcohol like I was losing you or I was losing Joe but I think that s that highlights any toxic relationship you know like yeah if you re in a toxic romantic relationship you re in it thinking like this is what s right like when things are right this is the warm hug and then like from an eagle s perspective it s like no that was awful and toxic an eagle s perspective wow that s so poetic patriotic um but yeah the the point being is like you like it s just like kids like one person s perspective is my life is over and another person s perspective is my life s just begun okay um in lighter news dude Avril Lavigne A A pulled the Uno reverse card on mod sun and just was like we re done without really telling him I guess it seems that way she hasn t made a statement Avril Lavigne okay so Avril Lavigne and Madsen had been dating for like a year when he proposed to her in Paris like last last Valentine s Day I don t know the timeline but whatever and they were engaged and then at Fashion Week she premiered her new boyfriend Tyga well I think they were also at no they were caught at Nobu kissing as well right and then they like she soft launched with a hard with a hard Peck yeah and then now they ve most recently been in at Paris fashion week and now I guess monsons was saying like oh it hurts because that s the place I proposed right and she I guess just decided it was a relationship that was no longer yeah mod Sun s representatives are like no one told him like in matson s mind he was still engaged are you sure well that s what madsen s team is saying you don t think I think there s probably writing on the wall and it s not going well but then they both go their separate ways he s on tour she s in Paris fashion week I know like do you think she broke up with him or do you think he because like one thing is like I m blindsided because I was broken up with out of nowhere another thing is like I open my phone and see that my girl my fiance is kissing tiger and I m no longer in a relationship I mean and they re a little different they re both bizarre though like I was also looking at a timeline of Avril Lavigne s relationships and she s been steady either engaged married or like on the brink of a proposal since wow maybe I m exaggerating it s such Jasmine three even all those times where people were questioning her whereabouts somebody knew yeah she was like because some magazine did like a breakdown of it it s like she was with her guitarist she was engaged to her guitarist they broke up nine months later she s engaged to this guy she married this guy they stay married they get a divorce she s then with this guy for a year and then she s with this guy for a year and then they re engaged and then well I hope she s found the one I hope she s keeping all these Rings like Drake out in these streets talking about I got engagement rings and avril s like the A A you do Laughter she A A kills me I also saw someone do a breakdown of like the like it matters that s the other thing that kills me so much I saw this too the Kardashian the Kardashian tree and it s like but what are you saying like you re just sort of explaining these relationships yeah like what I was like we know that A A Blac Chyna has Tyga s baby like we know that Travis is married to Courtney like what are you saying like swallowed my own spit uh do you want to get to these or should we jump to advice get into these yeah those are links you put some Bachelor thing and covid oh my God yeah okay you couldn t read your own link sorry I actually like can t see okay I don t know why you act surprised that I continue to not be able to see there s a thing called contacts I won t do it they feel bad um okay so the bachelor is crazy no it s not crazy it s super normal this season but the bachelor got covered for the first time a few weeks ago and so they re doing like iPad chats with this A A we are watching Bachelor Allah yeah like we re back to Skype yeah it was awful and so all the women are like oh no like we re so sorry like we hope you get well like we really hope you get well and then this girl Greer is trying to like identify with him and empathize with him so that he s like just to start a A A conversation with an A A on an iPad right and she s like you know I m a salesperson like you re a salesperson and I got covered during this last half of the fourth quarter and it was just like being pulled out of that was just like such a bummer so like I totally get what you re going through right now and he goes actually dude like I m trying to find my wife so this is a little bit different than sales like just instantly shits on her and she s like oh I know like I m not comparing like looking for a wife to a job I m just saying I understand what the A A do you think she s doing there yeah like she s there for a different reason yeah and he s like he s like that s really like he s like that s incentive and I don t like you that you said that and so I just really want to clear the record on this and say that like finding my wife is more important than the fourth quarter of sales I feel like he deserves no one no he s such a piece of A A I think he deserves a therapist wait wait wait for it it s about to get worse she gets covered and she s out of the game for two weeks and then when she gets out of quarantine and lockdown she s like I m so happy to be back I m so happy to go back on this journey of like finding love with you she sits down with me goes yeah when you had covet I just stopped caring so I m gon na send you home right now I think the girls should unite and walk no they re like we love him we A A love him is he great no none of these people are like red paper great they wouldn t have to do the bachelor to find A A love well they re on The Bachelor to find A A Fame yeah they re all trying to get an Instagram following and they re all actually like they re not they re like well who s here for the right reasons it s like the producers because it s their job are they there for the right reasons I mean they re there to get paid but they re there no it s dark it s dark it s dark yeah but that killed me so I had to tell you because like could you imagine this guy s like I ve covered and it s different and she s like I had coveted it was worse like he was barely symptomatic he s like I m just so tired like I m just like I m tired so they kept cutting to him in his hotel room like reading the A A menu and you d be like God I m just so fatigued and she s like I was violently ill for days like couldn t leave my room couldn t stand up like really sick and quarantined like sad and alone no one came to see me exact didn t check in on me and then he sent me home like A A him man okay well I m about to pee my pants but when we though wow can we break down just for two seconds wait wait wait wait oh you already hit unrecorded no do you want Chris want to talk about this story oh I wanted to talk yeah you guys have fun what um so no it s fine I wanted to tell you anyways I feel like you d care more okay you know Pablo Escobar yes okay so he had like four hippos and a moat around his house before he was like snatched okay and after he was snatched they became wild and there s no like Predators for them in that area so the four hippos turned into like hippos with no known predators and it s not like an invasive ass species that they have to figure out how to get rid of oh like way a ton each and it s like really hard to move that A A thousand pound hippos it s actually amazing it s not funny I didn t even know we had four hippos I dude every time like every time I hear more about like what Pablo Escobar had I m like this guy was lit you know who should have had a podcast Laughter now I got ta pee should we break down let s break down cutting okay let s get into some um okay so this one is a written submission give it to the blind girl okay hi Lizzy and Ryland to the point my girlfriend has gained some weight and honestly for me it s not that big of a deal I still find her sexy beautiful and just perfect but I do notice the weight gain has affected her emotionally and with her self confidence she doesn t eat the best and she tries working out but really hates it how do I encourage her to make healthier choices without hurting her feelings or making her feel like the weight gain is a problem for me I just want her to feel good about herself again I mean again I feel like honesty is the best policy I think uh you can show her through your actions and your words that you think she s beautiful no matter what and I think that can come from just complimenting her whenever you find necessary like when you walk into the kitchen and you re like oh my God that s my is it wife or girlfriend uh my girlfriend oh my gosh my girlfriend you re like so hot giving her affection and being like hey like your weight has nothing to do with how I view you or like doesn t take away from your hotness in my mind but I ve noticed like you re in your head about it you re spiraling about it and it s making you less present in our relationship which is bumming me out I wouldn t say that last part I would agree with everything that you said beforehand and don t bring up her weight gain as a thing that s bothering you because of her emotional spiral about it because that like I mean so I gained a bunch of weight and I feel weirdly about it because society makes me feel weird about it right but there s nothing weird about it like I look great I my butt is beautiful my arms are strong my you know like all these things I mean I wouldn t say that to a friend like if I I wouldn t say that to you if I was in a relationship with somebody and we re going on months of her not being able to function properly or not be present because she s in her head about gaining weight I would say something about that and that s me but I would I just I mean I just wonder because it s still not about how like it s not about I wonder if there s a way to do it without making it about the weight hey man I noticed that you re feeling a little bit down and I just I love you so much and I I hope that you can find peace and serenity in your mind because you re beautiful and wonderful and funny and I love you you know like a way to make it yeah so that it s not like the conversation is not like oh you gained weight now you suck I think that s what I was saying when I was saying no but like it s hard not to put that into a person s mind who s already spiraling do you know what I m saying well okay take weight out of it say like that s what I m saying no I m saying like let s say this was another scenario like you were in your head about something else that was like you were constantly there instead of here and it s like that s affecting our relationship and I want you to be more present with me that s why I think it s necessary I don t think you need to like jump the gun to get there but if like you start having a conversation and that door opens up and your girlfriend is like well yeah I do feel like because I ve gained a few pounds I m less confident and that makes me be more in my head and that like if you get to a point that s that then you re like well I think you re beautiful at every size and however you are and it doesn t affect how I view you but it is a bummer that like um because to me it s like if our bodies function like even with having thrown my back out it s like I take so for granted on the day to day the functionality of my body and I haven t been able to work out for three weeks like I prefer to work out and so I m I ve reframed it in my head as like oh it s my body s so incredible the functionality of my body is so incredible our bodies are made not to like look us any specific way so it is like for me getting out of my head about how a body should look and its actual function yes and if I m ruining my own life or day because of my how I look I need to get out of my head and be present with everything that is so full in my life exactly so that s what I mean when I say that s beautifully stated so but that s what I m saying like I didn t mean for it to come across as like you got to get out of your head so you can be more present with me yeah and if you re not getting there with your partner I think the safe bet is to suggest a therapist yeah always a safe best safe bet to suggest a therapist sorry I m crashing um but I also think that you know without saying much you can create a healthier environment because like for me if I m overthinking about like oh the calories I ve consumed are bad I have had carbs I have had sugar I have had this I ve had that I haven t worked out this many times I haven t burned this many calories if I m having those kinds of thoughts like I m not a functioning person in society I m not being of service to anybody I m just killing myself and I m living a really A A horrible existence while I die right and I think that if you want to take some of that burden off the table make her dinner that ll make her feel well you know I I I love queso queso makes me sick as a A A dog so it s not that I m not eating queso because I don t because I don t want to be fat I m not eating queso because it makes my body die it s poison it s outlawed in some countries like that s what like you know find a way to make positive food and flavor and joy that s not based around diet and physical appearance as a result yeah it s like I would prefer to have a salad because I don t feel like A A after I eat it you know what I mean like I want McDonald s so instead of going and get a hyper processed Burger I m gon na make myself a quarter pounder at home like there are ways to satisfy yourself emotionally and physically with food in a non toxic way and I mean toxic mentally and physically I think too before you even like before you have a conversation you could try a thing where you just make her feel confident by feeling loved exactly you know what I mean yeah and see how far that can take you not in like an over over like a performative type of way but like whenever it is necessary I think you could just really make her feel as though you appreciate her you love her you want to have sex with her like all of these things despite however she s feeling in her head because I mean maybe that s your first step before you go into a conversation that I talked about or I think that the second half of everything you said is great and I also think like take weight out of it tell her I ve noticed you re feeling down in the dumps and I that bums me up man because you re A A great and I do like you re saying also food does like chemically mess with my head like if I m eating really unhealthy it also A A me up eventually A A down her it hurts it actually like it hurts and you see me after I eat healthy food sometimes it A A hurts like you know what I mean like it s it s it s all about ensuring that what you re doing in everything is about love and kindness am I treating my body with love and kindness am I treating my mind with love and kindness am I using food as a punishment or a reward am I using the gym as a punishment or a reward finding an exercise that makes you feel good if you like going to yoga because at the end there s a emotional conversation that takes place and sets you right on your path for the day when you feel aligned and spiritually and physically or if you like going to Orange Theory because getting the Euphoria of a sweat like whatever finds a thing that makes that you brings you Joy when you re doing it yeah also being outside more helps I find that when I m hiking and in the sun more like I feel better my depression lifts more I m also in like the midst of like PMSing like a A A right now but it s you know I can manage it to some degree while still being a heinous A A to you and feeling bad about it now in retrospect I m sorry I was talking about James Van Derby I ll never know what it s like to be a woman so you re forgiven thank you for my Music relationship all right you guys well with that I hope you all have a fantastic week and thank you so much for watching and supporting our show follow us all on social media and we ll see you uh maybe next week maybe if not next week I am actually doing a what I eat in a day as a

Music so Music Music special episode that s going to reveal who we really truly are which is a couple of sick narcissistic A A whoa whoa whoa whoa speak for yourself i scored low on the narcissus test just you just told me your journal matches my journal and if your journal matches my journal well i ve evolved a lot as a person over the years this is spanning from me being to like and i would say that was when i was the most crazy i had ever been with every year i become a little more sensitive a little more emotional think a little bit more about everything i say in my interactions with everyone so before we get too deep hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of the zip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay hello hello we have a very special episode for you probably more special than our average episode because we re really diving deep not only into our past but also into our friendship oh really yeah so we re first you always be surprising me on this show we re first going into our journals this one s literally titled journal mine s not and then i also saw this game was going kind of viral oh cool we re not really strangers and i got the friendship edition so that will be um the later half of this podcast and there s like three different phases it s gon na be really fun we re gon na get deep with each other um but i thought we could start by sharing and this was all prompted by lizzy seeing a journal carrie underwood yeah she posted her journal entry on instagram from like the day or day one of the days around her winning american idol i wish i did A A like that what journaled like a normal person what do you mean like my journals have never been like specifically like today i woke up i ate a banana i went to the gym you know i never like write like that i m always journaling to save my A A life so it s like every journal page is an affirmation that i m not sure i believe yet so it makes me sound like a crazy person who s self obsessed but really i m like an insecure A A who s on the brink of A A jumping so it s like no don t jump you re great you re beautiful yeah so i haven t done this in a long time like my early s it was a lot of inspiration it was a lot of obsessing to become yeah it was i d a place where i would go to try to get inspired but then also um really dive into my dark days and i feel like i would journal on days i felt defeated more than the positive days and there s even some posts and posts there s even some entries in here where i m like i i journey when i m happy too like these things went good today it s not all sad is this the journal i wrote in yeah it is it is it s somewhere in here i can post a picture of the asset all right ryland you are so good at what you do you are perfect perfect xoxo lizzie but yeah like mine starts with just a bunch of quotes i have like cut out clips i said like what are you going to do to further your acting today i have been here too when i realized uh that i wasn t a good actor and that i was a great host and i felt inspired to become just that one of the first notes i have in here is like jill notes so like when someone would read something i had written i would take notes in my journal about it but it s very funny and it s just jill s first reflection upon me is constant pant A A you A A your pants so much it s a little like inflation like it it doesn t matter anymore i would argue that both inflation and A A your pants still matter thank you like you should get hold of it oh um i would give anything to A A my pants right now bro i have been constipated for a week yeah and i ve got vasavaso i m not trying to go out like elvis that dude died with a month worth of A A stuck in his track on the toilet trying to poop really swear to god i was going to ask if that would be depicted in the movie because i do feel like constipation really is like they glamorize it no it s not glamorized i feel like it just it really weighs on a person like one day i feel like i can t be my utmost version of myself no i m not thriving i think i m gon na do the chia seed challenge see if it flushes my sister what the A A is that i saw on tick tock that if you eat two tablespoons of chia seeds in water with lemon juice you will A A instantaneously no i swear i m gon na need you to make a tick tock debut for this i ve been on tick tock okay but like make a video doing that because if it doesn t work i m going to tick tock s cancelled okay that s that so do you have like a standout journal entry that you wanted to share with the class mine is like a lot of planning like i wrote out all the casting directors like and agents i could submit to um so a lot of mine in the beginning was just like plotting how i was going to make something big of myself if i can close my eyes i can feel success and it tastes so great the air is clear my world is upside down and nothing i can do but smile because i made it i made it to where i ve always dreamed of as my reality i was like you re a flowery ass A A i was doing the like manifesting as though it had already happened you were two i mean i was i found one that s more like i didn t realize this but uh this i just found an entry that s more of like a day in the life of lizzie um but most of mine are that like what you just did okay well i ll go to a dark post of mine what no do you have a good one it s it s not necessarily good it s just one of the sad affirmations you are great you are love you are from a place oh you act from a place of joy and hope and wonder i am proud to be me i love who i am the dark part is this isn t that long ago no i ve been in a dark place what did we talk about last week sad girl things jesus christ it s i mean it s not it s not recent i am proud to be me i love who i am i am dark and curious and silly and light and capable and beautiful no one thinks like me i love joking i love joe and then i used to sign off every journal entry rob believes in me because the director of that improv program that you think is a pyramid scheme i i m part of this improv group but you say that like i know lizzy isn t actively performing in improv so no i don t actually perform in anything anymore in the podcast right uh you posted like a a screenshot of an upcoming turbine turbine collected i replied to know how lonely this summer are you part of an mlm now like what s going on because i know she s not performing so i was like what are you selling no but i do have to say like the turbine art collective that s summering at the noho lemley um i don t even know if it s the no whole lumley just look at my profile i m really bad at plugging this mlm that s why i m poor but the guy who runs it the director of the program is a man named rob watsky and rob used to say to me like lizzie i believe in you and rob s like a funny guy like he s very practical he s not overly expressive so when rob told me he believed in me i was like i m gon na be okay sometimes all it takes is one like i have very pivotal i ve two instances where people said things to me that really propelled me moving forward like even before i left colorado in the first place like one of my best friend s parents were like if anyone could be an actor i think it could be you and he said it like kind of jokingly but it really did stick with me and then another one of my mom s friends he was teasing me and he definitely didn t mean it but i took that to heart and boy did i ride it hard and another one of my mom s friends at one point was like i could see you being like ryan seacrest and doing his jobs and i was like you know what i see that too and those have always stuck with me so and then i don t know i think things like that like yeah well that s what i started signing my every single time i d sign off my diary and rob believes in me rob believes in you exo lizzie the shining star that s sad i love how yeah okay uh so this one is titled feeling this is before i was out i never like uh yours are like artsy i never journaled really about how i was feeling often like in terms of like coming to accept myself and i think i blacked out that period of my life because i always feel like coming out for me was just easy but in retrospect it wasn t um so i said how can i accept myself when i can t even write on paper what i m feeling because i m scared to coming out i still remember the first person i came out to to i shared a studio apartment have already told you this story and i shared a studio apartment and we were both in our beds about to fall asleep and i just kept being like i think i have to tell you something and then it like went back and forth without me being able to say it for a long time and then i was like i don t know maybe could you say it and then eventually she was like you re gay are you gay and i was like yeah i don t know maybe rylan you sweet bear then this journal entry says art imitating life today i read for a movie i needed i want to embrace this character to feel what i ve been longing for in my own life it s something that i needed i m crossing my fingers um almost regret not going high what does that mean because when i would smoke i would feel like i could really embody characters in like an insane way like i could see i could lose i mean and that s what i think drinking and smoking does for a lot of people like you lose your inhibitions and so i felt as though when acting if i got stoned i could really lose my identity and my isms and become somebody else and have their personality which is really dark like not a good place to enter acting but i was like wish i would have gone high also had an ihop commercial audition and skipped out on my work uh went to a movie with friends great day good night cute cute do you have one for us i mean like this one i could i totally forgot i don t know if we ve ever talked about this this one s titled just a journal entry i wish i would have dated mine more a few of mine have dates but a lot of them do not today i had the pleasure of bringing my grandpa to bear claws and an apple fritter i saw him yesterday as well it was monday because i missed our sunday visit he lights up when i m in the room and i can uh not help but to feel saddened by this he is so sweet and he has been so abused together we laugh but my heart aches for an elder for an earlier opportunity to do right by this human he is human and he ought to be loved so my grandpa it s kind of like a sordid past he s my mom s dad but he abandoned my mom and her family when she was so i never knew him until i was and when i met him it was like it s a frivolous meeting of a stranger you know and he was cognizant at the time or lucid or whatever and i gave him my phone number and i was like if you ever want to you can call me so he put my number in his wallet and then he came he was in an accident and nobody talks to this man because he abandoned all of his children he like started a family left it started another family and left it lived as a hermit for a really long time and then resurfaced yeah so when he was in the accident the only phone number that they could find on his person was mine in his wallet so i was like but this was probably when i was because i remember i was living with my girlfriend mallory when i got the call that he was in the hospital at ucla and needed somebody to come get him and that he had like full blown dementia you don t know this man essentially but he s my family so like i couldn t leave him high and dry so i actually went to ucla and then from that point on i was his legal guardian and we had to like there was a bunch of like he had none of his affairs in order i had to figure out how to get his money from his account because i had no money like i was paying to live on a couch like i couldn t bring him home because i didn t have a home and um you know with the help of social workers because i was young and dumb like i realized if i wore a crop top people would help me so i m like helping this poor old man in a crop top like stealing clothes from the clothing store i work at and spending weekends with him getting bear claws at galsons and smoking cigarettes and honestly like it was kind of fun because we re both A A so don and i would just go be A A around town but you know and did you learn anything great from him um i think i learned the uh i i think i learned to at this point stop the cycle of abandonment and abuse in my family like even though this man hurt most of my family i can forgive him as they could not and i can love him as as they struggled to because of the pain and um i think that s a very valuable thing because instead of choosing to go forward with like resentment and hate in my heart i can go forward with love and well you know like the lesson of like this man left everybody and now he s left at the end of his life with no one and like that A A sucks and i don t know if any of you have ever been to a a cheap or a state run facility for old people but it is a A A nightmare it s really awful and it breaks your heart to know that there are people there who are wards of the state that nobody visits yeah and so you know it taught me to act lead with love yeah no that s incredible that s the only thing of value in here on a lighter note in mine my job this is uh where we met right now i work at a restaurant in brentwood called lebron quitting we love to hear it it s a richie breakfast place and definitely pays my bills our clientele equals yoga moms rich yoga moms and movie stars i have waited on so many people and and my favorite being reese witherspoon died that s so funny my favorite being reese witherspoon it was i really thought i think i ve already said but like she ordered an iced tea lemonade and it served in a carafe and i was like shaking pouring it being like nervous yeah oh my gosh reese witherspoon in my presence she s such an icon i love her i love her okay here s me trying to sort out my identity i said i ve decided when it comes to work or my career i can probably be the most confident person i know but when it comes to actual social outings i m the one out or not as comfortable with my body language i have to think about what this means in terms of who i am and what i stand for and where i see myself in the world i missed a call back weeks ago because of work for a short film but today the director emailed me with a viral video he wants me to do of course is a jbeeb s parody film but whatevs i ma look into that whatevs imma look into it the abbreviation of jay beeves of course nobody wants me to be me everybody wants me with biebs if i don t take it if it s a paycheck no but i think uh i was so immersed in what i was trying to do that i had lost uh what normal people my age were doing which was like being social and having fun and going out to dinner and movies and partying and i felt like my identity was what i was trying to do which was work because if i wasn t waiting tables i was trying to get out of waiting tables and to a job i loved so i find myself in at parties just being like well i don t know how to do this or interact amongst other people i to this day don t either and i feel like that s why you and i became such fast friends because we were team get the A A on tv we were like never not working girls and i think that was uh something we had in common was we liked to spend our time trying to further ourselves yeah instead of just having a like that was us having a good time whereas i feel like a lot of other people their good time is like going out drinking having yeah just socializing and i don t mind that i think because what we have is so creative and like you know sometimes for your life like getting to create something for your vlog is actually like living for me because it s not my job you know what i mean like no and i have so much fun but i also like when you took me to six flags it s it s so fun to also look back on to ever to have it was fun we like blacked out and fun there i do appreciate that about your vlogs Laughter so that s what i mean is like it was worth it to me to struggle for so long to be able to now have a job where i get to live in what i consider fun yeah and i also think that that s the that s the general consensus for everyone in their s like it s a A A and everybody tells it to you while you re in the struggle you re like i don t know dude like i m really not sure i m ever going to be okay and they re like no you ll be okay you ll hit your s things will just start to happen and you re like i don t know dude and they re let s like no because you re panicking now you re planting the seeds the seeds will grow they will turn into flowers you will pick the flowers and it s like wow and i m still planting seeds and i m still always thinking about what seeds i can plant that will be in a year or two or three years from now yeah we got ta we got ta you got ta keep planting seeds that s what life is but it is so interesting in your s when you have A A nothing and like the fear and it s like but then the certainty of the adults the the older adults around you where they re just like now chill out and it s like i can t chill out yeah there is it s like a balance of the two because you want to secure a future but you also don t want to grow up so fast that you missed it yeah um i think i m i m sorry i m going a lot this is like my last one but i think this is very relevant to all of this because this was december nd of i had been away from home for years i got back from i was home for the holidays and i was reflecting on hanging out with all of my friends from high school and what they were doing now and i said i looked at my lifestyle as my friends from high school shared feelings and emotions from from their college their current college things i couldn t do or bond with or relate to at all and i felt like an old man because i m the same age but i m like living this weird life in california i feel like an old man but not an accomplished one not being educated is not a cool thing because they re all just talking about like what their degrees are and what their job like they re all like at the point where they were securing jobs for themselves and getting real salaries and i was like uh it s not a cool thing to not be educated and i feel like i m missing a part of my generation but in a weird way it also assured me that i m doing the right thing which is like chasing my dreams um i said i might not be rich and i might not be as far along as some of the people my age but i know i need to bust my ass and do anything and everything to make uh basically entertainment be my reality acting you can say i did say but i just i always felt this taking a risk on myself because when i would come home everyone would be in their like salary jobs that they re making now a year and i still have nothing to show for myself i m waiting tables at two different restaurants and then my roommates also had real jobs and i d be like what am i doing i m like getting older and all these people are progressing and that s what would fuel me further to be like i have to make something of myself or i m going to be doing this forever here s something i can relate to it says on the same page and then it s just a little guy saying hello is anyone on the same page as me no no one sad do you have any like journal entries that you can read us i read a couple right um let s see more about rob oh no i don t want to read that i left out some very humiliating stuff as well i mean it s like deep deep and dark i love some humiliating stuff out also that s so funny no i m sure i can find something because like a lot of my stuff is what uh what am i trying to say it s it s it s my made up stories which i m actually starting to realize like like how we were just talking about like we like talking about work more than we like talking like anything else we like doing work more than we like anything else and like our relationship got stronger when we started working together and i don t think a lot of friends can say that but you and i love what we do so much that it like is a bonding force but i m noticing like because i went through like diaries and this was the one i picked because it had the most personal things in it and what i m noticing is even in my journaling i prefer to talk about made up stories that i m writing than i d like to talk about myself and i think that that s kind of interesting i don t know what it means it s only something that i m just now having an epiphany of but like it might be this might be another form of escapism for me like give me an example of like a made up story what do you mean like i will do uh like a lot of this is um early jokes from my stand up set so you would kind of do it as a inspiration board slash journal hybrid which is what i did too like i would cut and paste quotes like the amount of quotes in this thing is embarrassing like how i would just like obsess obsess obsess over how i was going to make anything and everything work out for myself yeah like even this per like here s a quote from ryan seacrest to manifest success obsess yeah literally so a lot of this is like me doing that wow fascinating i used to have this really fun idea that i still don t want to give up on called mean girl quantum leap which i just am like always thinking like there if there was a squad of like like i feel like this the most conniving manipulative capable people on the face of this earth are teenage girls specifically mean ones because they can plant these like psychotic little bombs in your mind and just make you feel so shitty that it s like you ll destroy yourself over a word they utter in your direction because they know like they know the root of your insecurity and what makes you A A feel miserable so i was like wow like we don t need assassins like we don t need the cia we don t need seal team six we need a A A quantum leap mean girl squad that just goes back in time and like hangs out with hitler for a day and it s like they re like oh tiny man do your mama really love you or did she not really love you and she s like she didn t love me and it s like so i had a bunch of sketches that were just series of like young girls who are like in sheer uniforms hella peppy like the early audis quintessential mean girl and they would just go into a scenario and flippantly say something nasty or like the one of the sketches i wrote that i really loved was when we this is so dorky when we were when america was developing the atomic bomb there were two different labs that were working on it there was uh one in livermore actually which is where i grew up the lawrence livermore lab and then there was another facility that actually developed the bomb but they were in competition with each other so that one would develop it quicker than they are in space right yeah exactly but this was both in america this wasn t us against the russians or whatever this was us against us to come up with the atomic bomb as fast as we possibly could and so in my the sketch i have both scientist teams presenting their atomic bomb and everyone s like oh ah like so scary so crazy and then another doctor comes up and he goes i ve got something even worse than that she s got the like she s the the meanest A A with the hottest tits and she can throw kicks higher than anyone i know meet trixie and she like comes in the room and like looks at the president up and down she goes ew like they just sent her off to end world war ii by just being a A A to all of the superpowers so that s what s in my thing yeah i do think uh yes teenage girls can be well i i wasn t affected as much by teenage girls because for some reason they ve locked to me and were nice to me because they could sense maybe you re one of them i think i was just the gay guy so girls felt comfortable around me or you re one of them revelations um but i still think it is the sentiment that uh people play on other people s insecurities is still true very much so on the internet too if you reveal something that you re insecure about on the internet they will hold you that way and use it against you they ll hold you down and beat you over the head with it for time to come um also can i just take a pause yeah i feel like you and i just got caffeinated and we jumped into this like a couple of cokeheads why because we did i was we re like wait everybody sit down really fast here s the podcast let s talk about kindergarten it was a really gnarly A A time i told you anybody have any cigarettes a little bit of a different episode it s a coked out A A crazy A A episode oh my gosh wait this one entry just says it s wednesday i know Laughter i was like let s bring our diaries today s podcast is

start with level one which is um perception so level one is all about gaining perspective on how your friend sees you it s also a test to see how well you know each other and we re in a fight right now possibly with the first uh answer with the response that first comes to mind um if you guessed incorrectly feel free to give the actual answer i blacked out the last part of what you just said i don t think it matters did you even retain what you just said i don t know if i m supposed i m unclear on if i m supposed to like read and ask you the question but we re both A A blacked out okay what s one small detail you remember about the first time we met that you pranced over to me in the in the closet i was in the closet and he was in the closet because i was in an actual closet was i coming to get a juice or was i boldly coming over to meet a redhead i think you were boldly coming over to meet a redhead and i feel like at that point in time or like really soon after you like spanked me but i really hate being spanx oh oh my gosh i remember because you got mad yeah it s very triggering for me yes because you like snapped at me oh he used to make me cry we didn t know each other very well no but that was a phase in time when everybody was smacking each other on the ass and it was like a normal greeting but it was really upsetting for me that and understandably so but like as a server in the restaurant that i worked at that s how that s like that everybody like we would walk into work and everyone would slap each other s butts it was literally a point in time where everybody in every clique was smacking each other on the butt like hey girl hey girl it s like everybody was touching butts but let me tell you guys i do not like my butt being interested no and she lost it you know in an appropriate way being if that s a trigger for someone but i just remember feeling like i like had shoved my foot in my mouth and didn t know how to recover from it and i was like oh my gosh i just like assaulted this person no but i was i m scentsy we were covered here we are imagine i just woke up from a crazy night out where did i end up and what do i regret well that s so uncharacteristic if the year was it s anywhere in weho but you strap on your rollerblades and you go home and you regret not staying in your own bed and doing your A A facial routine couldn t be further from the truth really yeah because you never stayed over at anyone s house you left immediately after oh no uh i i m talking about now this would never happen now no you will you don t sleep at anyone s house now no yeah no but yes in yeah mm hmm yeah i i d be wilding out and that s what oh wow we re goofballs oh it s at minutes on both okay um oh you re unpredictable you could have been anywhere in your no i was either at your house with my shoes on in your bed or in my car in front of the house i lived in waiting oh today uh what are we how do we answer that well i just don t think this applies to us today well we don t go anywhere we re very predictable and boring yeah to this day it s your house or mine like honestly this is stupid oh can you get a good one no maybe pick from the middle okay it s hard to do with my nails what assumption did you make about me that was furthest from the truth ooh i smell a fight i mean i didn t realize you had an alcohol problem oh you was farthest well no because you would come i mean we were with each other at all times but yeah and you would come over and chug an entire bottle of wine but i just i didn t take it as like for some reason i just thought it was normal for our age right and you would be blacked out all the time right and i d just be like she just likes to have a good time it s so funny now i m thinking back to earlier today your dad just like pressing he s like you want to like it in oh like no thanks well the way you store him a drug addict the way you stormed into the house seemed as like you might have needed one because my head hurts so bad and she s like i need tylenol and i need water and so i m like dad do you have advil liquid gels because lizzie said i m gon na kill myself if i don t get liquid advil liquid gels like so specific and i said oh my god they don t have that so i m like going through the medicine cabinet and my dad found some prescription thing from when he was supposed to have the surgery and he kept pushing them on lizzie and yeah i don t think my dad if he had asked me one more time i would have been like A A yeah bruce crack that A A out let s A A let s crush it up and snort it so it hits the stream a little faster than mine oh this is an addict so funny though he also really has been getting me lately because like like today i needed to go pick up a light for the podcast and i needed to go over there the other day to pick up my animals and i keep saying like hey dad do you mind if i stop over i need to come get x and x and he ll be like sure and i m like oh he hates me you re crazy that s literally the text thing that you added to the docket yes because i don t know is there i ve been seeing it go around with like a lot of adults where parents will text their kids and their kids will be like why are you so mad at me and they re like i refuse to not use right punctuation because it hurts your feelings like with this sure period yeah it s just like a little too oh that s why you when you re texting you need to like be over the top so i disagree i can t convey that i mean but i never feel that way with you yes you do you sent me an apology text after you sent a period at the end of the normal sentence and i was like i don t get it oh but you hadn t reacted to it it s cause i m busy baby says the person that texts me all day non stop yeah oh what was your did you have any weird assumptions about me no i was a big homosexual yeah oh wait did you just pull that card should we get deep and go to level two yeah let s go level two let s go we know each other better than this let s go deep deep okay what was my last breakup like for you i never really seriously dated anyone i will say that your breakup with my good friend was a devastating blow in our relationship we ve already we ve already we have but it s you pulled the card and i m answering okay it was devastating for me too it i wasn t in the right place no no no that s fine does he ever bring me up yeah all the time really yeah he would he does nothing but wish you ill really you won t even listen to the podcast no i m kidding he s not thinking about you he s married and happy i wish him well he s doing well okay no i m totally joking he literally doesn t bring you up okay sorry you just got exhausted what do you want to make more time for what s getting in the way of that so i m supposed to answer this yeah wait we got to read the level two instructions where s that little crumply paper i don t know can anybody tell me how the hell do you know okay i can t listen to that i don t even know the real word so it s partially like an original lizzie gordon i guess uh how careful my knees don t bend up i don t know well seriously make it up you answer for yourself what is it maybe i hate this game what do you want to make more time for what s getting in the way of that um to just really live it up and you know what i feel like i m out of computer editing all day every day and i feel like it s really taking up my everything so i would like to find an editor and i know i ve had offers but it s hard for me to execute and relinquish that what feels like power because i feel like it s such a tedious long process to find the right fit and get a person to where i would like them to be to cater to my style so it s exhausting to me can i make an unsolicited advice yeah structure your day a little bit more my day s very structured do you have a quitting time um i mean on days that aren t the day before an upload day yes but then if my deadline hasn t been met then it goes a little over it s normal yeah sorry what about you what do i want to make more time for what s getting in the way of um i d like to make more time for my husband and i would say our polar opposite schedules are getting in the time in the way of that i would like to do yoga with him quite frankly you didn t ask but that s what i d like to do no i mean i like that i just doing a yoga i don t like going to yoga with other people i feel like it s a very no i m not trying to i m not trying to talk to him but it s like i would like to go to yoga with him as a regular thing that we do as a couple there i said it that s a big ask is it i think so well is he ever gon na go to yoga with you dude probably not he won t even go to bed with me i found the directions this is legit a co cat episode number one put your phone away screen time is high enough this week level two who are you really this round is about asking the really the rarely asked questions and connecting on a deeper level okay yeah we re just asking each other what are you usually wearing when you have the best time what do you always regret wearing oh oh um i like wearing this is so absurd i want to know i love wearing an oversized t shirt specifically my ghostbed shirt which is stupid because the bed that we have is a ghost bed not sponsored but they like send you a t shirt with it and joe jokingly was like do you want the t shirt i was like yeah with a knee shirt i love the t shirt i uh i have two now two t shirts um and i love wearing that with the tennis necklace that he bought me and some short shorts it s insane and what do you always regret wearing i always regret wearing these pants to be completely honest they re two sizes too big but they re cute and they just feel bad they make my stomach hurt but not like physically like they make me embarrassed to be me and i can t explain it can you put them in hot water and and dry them on hold no but i could move the button over like to here this i don t know about this game tell me you re fading without telling me you re fading stupid we ve got a cinnamon roll to get to after this so we better just power through uh i uh like wearing the v neck that i have uh ten of in three different colors because it always just fits me right oh yeah and i always regret wearing underwear that are too tight because i can never get comfortable and i wish that i had just gone commando always instead of wearing tight underwear damn i guess i have some panties i hate wearing too what s the most recent thing you ve been influenced to buy skims really yeah i bought skim shapewear for the thong but i got ta say as a girly who A A with kim k heavy oh my god we didn t even talk about the kardashians last week and it was the big episode what i don t think i ve seen it yet sorry wow they can t commentate on it and so when this airs there have been another big episode that night where whatever we ll have a full blown recap maybe but by then it ll last week s news okay so i bought the skim s thong shapewear in beige um because often because i like my my thick ass but i would like to have a little bit more shapely tummy because i m bloated all the time and i m just trying to suck that A A in um and i ve noticed that my pants feel more comfortable if i wear shapewear sometimes but the problem is it s like this is made for like a long torso A A or something but it s like the thong part goes up so high that the only part that s getting compressed is my rib cage which doesn t need compressing are there different sizes i got a small so maybe i m an extra small but i don t know because it all it compresses weird because then it also has to sit above my hips otherwise it ruins my hip shape and then now i just have like a bunch of A A shoved down on top of my hips which is unseemly is that a word both of the things we were influenced to buy did not work out for us because i ve really been wanting an aura ring i honestly have been what the A A is the point of that everybody be tracking their sleeping A A what does that do for you it s your like don t you check your steps on your phone no i do like i know you do i obsessively do it i always like to make sure that i m going more than the previous week and i like it s just something i like to do and i would like to track my sleep and i always hear them sponsoring podcasts so i reached out to our ad agency i was like can ordering sponsored the podcast dead silence never got back to me so auring if you re listening hit us up um because i m like what s the point i d love in order honestly if it s free give it to me no so then i saw uh gucci came out with a collab with orange oh yeah i was like wow this is like i ve been on the line of an oaring for months i and i was like i m just gon na bite the bullet and do it and so i did it and i was like you re supposed to have it on whatever finger this is and point your fingers so i put on ring shane s ring that is like the similar style that they converted into the aura ring and i was like perfect i know my size and i waited for two weeks i got so excited because my delivery had arrived yeah i put it on the other day and it was too A A big can i have it and i called and i said i sized this to other rings another gucci ring and he said oh well they re aura ring sizes and i was like well you did it in european sizes and he s like i know it s european sizes but it s aura rings and so i call them and they re like well we don t have the size that you need it s only at some stores did you return it yeah so i returned it it didn t work out i i called i tried calling all the stores that would have it and then i got in a fight with the gucci employee because he was pissing me off this is embarrassing you might have overshared just now also no he let me just can i just tell you a little bit about it yes okay so then the gentleman that was helping me do it initially was so nice and he called three different stores because it s no longer online so he s like it s only at some of the stores i ll call the stores for you and i was like great so we called three of the stores and he was like none of them have it and i was like okay bummer so then on my own i wasn t gon na make him look further so i started trying to call the individual stores that showed that they had it on my own but then when i finally got connected the guy s like oh this isn t the individual store it s only for the store like you only reach our customer service which is like our main hub for A A sake and he s like they ve already done three requests for you and they re only allowed to do one so he already overdid what he was allowed to do for you and i was like don t you want to sell rings and why can t you just see in your computer what store has it in stock so you can ship it to me he s like i just can t do that and i was like well i don t know why you can t do that like why can t you help me out like i obviously purchased the ring already i just want the right size he s like is there anything else i can help you with i was like well i don t think you helped me yet you said that yes i was so mad do you have that tone of voice or did you have a nap no i said it i said it in the middle of tone and then so i m convinced he canceled all of the requests i already had so i m never gon na have an aura ring and i m so sad damn some that was a lot to take in i think you asked this next one i feel like i did two in a row oh my gosh okay when was the last time you were a bad friend what could have you done differently well i guess we can bring up the beef you brought up last week because that was technically the last time i was a bad friend when i hood winked you into accompanying me to sloanes to pick up my pineapple dole whip and then i abandoned you wanted nothing to do with me and didn t even want to stay there and eat it with me but here s the deal i recognized my selfish ways she didn t apologize i sent you a textbook i said listen listen i m sorry for hoodwinking yeah i don t engage with that many people so i don t know the last time i did somebody wrong did i do you wrong recently or something no feels like you have something but i don t think so actually i ll let it pass i feel like should we get to number three and we go back to two if it s not super juicy let s move on no i don t think you ve ever wronged me wild card oh buckle up both players set an intention for your friendship compare you know what i am like so grateful for you like when i watched back the vlog from six flags i thought wow i have so much fun with you and you re a very thoughtful giving caring friend i was so scared you were about to say butt because it s make set an intention oh so i would just like to continue on our path of deepened friendship okay i m done with that too you same okay i wouldn t mind no that s a crazy intention i m third on your call list but whatever no i was gon na say i wouldn t mind moving to colorado and being a suburban A A mom with you we would have so much fun but i can t set that up there s so much that i would love to do with you here like we if you were staying here today if the things that we could do i know and honestly i thought i was gon na be here long enough that we could go to a workout class between episodes and the restaurants i want to try um okay actually can i that can that that ll be my intention what i want to change our work trips into more fun trips well if you would stay longer than i understand why you can t but if you could stay for like uh like if we could record the podcast one day hang out together because we do have lots of fun together that s definitely the intention i want to set actually okay um i don t love that one what s the last time you had a big win how can we celebrate um oh A A sorry i have these blisters all over my feet and i need honey to come lick them yeah uh what was my last big win i don t know i guess i would say my last big win was probably getting the puppy oh my gosh yeah and then um that woman i m riding with now yeah which is a huge win yeah and we can celebrate bye i don t know like a little bit for me when i think about celebrating it s like the work is the celebration for me because i love the work yeah getting paid to do the work is a celebration um i don t know oh wait what should i announce my youtube channel oh my gosh yeah i got over subscribers on my youtube channel because we had been reacting to our past videos yeah and honestly you should make the ones of us unlisted or uh public so that they can go watch what s live now so if you go to elizabeth gordon on youtube i ll link it listen i think oh you changed it because there i had that ambition at the beginning of the year of being a youtuber which i still think you should toy around with i don t know she has should we just pull the trigger on it and say like just this week there s gon na be a cooking video yeah so if you guys could subscribe to her and support the video when it goes live uh we ll let you know when it s up on instagram should i just make a commitment right now that forces me to do it well yeah but are you going to post the video that you already have filmed do they get ready with you you have to film a whole new one yeah okay yeah i think you should this pick a day pick a day make it happen uh i think tuesdays i upload typically on thursdays the podcast is wednesdays shane uploads his podcast on sunday so i think tuesday or friday friday friday well friday like people go out on fridays and then they live on saturdays so not a great day for youtube tuesdays tuesdays next tuesday wow i m gon na post a cooking video i m excited i m gon na make creamy tuscan chicken okay so i ll leave her link her channel link in the description section below watch we can call you up from the uber delete that part of the video i m not going to so go subscribe to her channel it might be the one and only girlies um i think my recent big celebration is moving forward on shane and i having a child hell yeah there hasn t been many updates because there aren t many updates yet right i mean i m hoping that we can uh have a surrogate within the next like four months ideally like that would be yeah i m manifesting for you within the next two months everything with the egg donor is moving forward hopefully the embryos will be frozen soon and then like obviously you don t announce you re pregnant until the pregnancy is like very solidified so can i throw you a baby shower to celebrate uh yeah okay yeah once it s like right in full motion we ll have a baby shower yeah i mean with our timeline with like a best case scenario i m thinking like my birthday present will it be your baby yeah A A all over my fourth of july dreams he s like i m manifesting and by manifesting i mean impregnating when i decide to is it crazy to manifest your child s sign no i think a lot of people do it okay yeah yeah got ta avoid them gemini s baby stuff i m married to one i m allowed to say it yeah A A is crazy as my girlfriend lizzo once said it s like a threesome A A with them every night yeah yeah another wild card do you ever know which one you re getting nope nope just kidding i love him what i don t like okay get a new one there s no rules for us i should have pre selected yeah that was my intention but i lost track of time what s the best way i can show up for you when you re going through it i feel like we have the same answer for this what leave me alone don t tell me you can hear me crying mind your A A business no i feel like we re very communicative like uh when i ve gone through hard things you ve actually shown up in great ways which is just offering the support if i need it like i m here if you need me yeah yeah but i think both of us prefer to be left alone to scream cry yeah the only one i really melt down around is shane yeah same with joe yeah because i love being held by joe oh my god last night for example i was crying but i wasn t scream crying and i wasn t scream crying because i knew that james could hear me and joe was like in the room and just like how can you be nice i wish i could scream cry right now but i don t want james to hear me i i m starting to get concerned with how much you re screaming ice cream cry every day well here s the deal i know i m not withholding the screams the funniest thing the funniest thing was i swore to god i was like i was positive in my heart of hearts i was alone in the house no one was there so i was just walking from room to room scream crying at the top of my lungs from room to room and then i turned around from the kitchen james is sitting in the living room how does he react to something i literally couldn t stop crying i was like i wouldn t be crying this hard if i knew you were here it was like the most pathetic moment because i couldn t draw it back you know what i mean i was in my field and are you always crying about the same thing or is it yeah okay well i d say the same couple things it s always the same couple things it s a A A sad time bro but it was i was so shocked i was like uh what s something i don t give myself enough credit for oh everything are you talking about you or me no you oh i think it was a personal question i m gon na do it i don t think you give yourself enough credit for everything and i think that s why you trip about your vlogs posting what do you mean like i think part of your anxiety is you don t realize that all that A A that you used to write in your journals like those manifesting things like living it and like make making it a thing what did you speaking until you make it it s the dumb A A version that i say but i think you don t realize how much you have accomplished and how much of that is because of you and i think that you could take a little bit more time to like take a deep breath and be like girl well thank you i feel like i m always on what feels to be i enjoy the work i do but it does sometimes feel like a never ending treadmill like i m like okay i got ta vlog up wow i have another hours of editing ahead of me yeah so it does feel like i i i do want to come up for air more which is why i need to delegate like that s what i hear so many youtubers like we have to you have to delegate things to be able and i would live a more fulfilling life you know like i don t know that you celebrate your wins i think i do you do because you A A on kim kardashian for doing that which makes me think if you spot it you got it like should you well no it s just jarring to me that she s still it s not that sh i want her to celebrate her successes it s the can t believe it s me right and it s like well i can believe it s you right and i can but like when things happen to me i m like well i can believe it s me i ve worked a decade to try to get anything right so when i get something like it s not i can t believe it i ve been working forever for this it seems like your mind might be skewed to if you don t succeed you re like i can t believe i didn t do well enough but you but if but the the more positive reframe of it is girl i do i think like the kim kardashian state of mind is the place to be like because if you re no longer excitable about what you re doing it s over do something else yeah yeah um uh what about you baby girl i think i don t remember the question well it s something you don t give yourself enough credit for i think how much you give to the people around you like i really think you show up for those in your life in a way that is very uh is very what s the word i m trying to say um i guess respectable like jaw dropping to me like the way that you re able to show up for everyone in your life is incredible to me i appreciate that but i see that as i don t see that as like oh you know what i mean like i don t see it as a pat on my back i see it as these A A showed up for me yeah so it s more so like i can t not be there because i owe them i have a i have a great debt of gratitude for those people and that ties back to kind of your lesson with your estranged grandpa yeah which is like being there for others so yeah you re not alone and it s also like it even most of these people were there for me when i was a small child so it s like i mean even take people out of it yeah dogs like your willingness to go to four different vet appointments all an hour away from each other in one day and never complain about it right but you know my dogs did a lot for me oh i m not saying they didn t but it s like never a complaint about it which is i m i for completely to be super real i m in a very blessed position that i don t i m not forced into a corner and and i i have options and there are a lot of people who are forced into a corner and don t have options yeah so i m just incredibly grateful that i i get the opportunity to take them to four A A vet specialists yeah because not everybody does and that sucks ass um but yeah i mean i don t know i don t again like i think i m i just think i m lucky i think i m lucky that there s a A A costco cart full of A A who showed up for me and you know the funny thing is like at the beginning you don t think you re worth showing up for right like at the beginning you re just the A A kid who s destroying everything and doesn t understand why things are going wrong but like you know i just mean like even like the day to day tasks that have to be done it s a lot to i mean it s hard to run a household yeah to keep things clean to to stay on top of everything and then a dish in addition i think that s why people s circles get smaller as they get older because it s just so hard to maintain doing it all yeah yeah yeah finish this sentence you re the only person i can blank with hmm i mean you re the only pers i would say like you and shane and i mean you re definitely the outside of my love relationship i feel comfortable being my authentic self with you like i never censor myself around you which i can t say for everyone you know yeah i would say same i would also say like i enjoy chilling with you yeah we don t and i hate chilling like i am not a chill girl but i like chilling with you yeah we don t need we re we re those kind of girls where we don t have to like be super like it s not weird if you re staying at my house and we re not doing something we don t have to do i could sit quietly and watch you edit for a long time from the dog s bed like to be completely real i would not mind laying an uno s bed and watching you do nothing for a A A five hours okay let s try to get one more before we have to say goodbye like literally um what s something that reminds you of me yoga rollerblades i love how the rollerblade thing is so stamped in your mind because it s such a A A visual when you explore when you explain that one scenario to me i was like damn that s an identity and it was a forced identity because like my car i i could never tell if it was going to start or make it from point a to point b so it s like the roller blades it is that s reliable so funny i think it kills me because it s such a thing it s so iconic oh i would say your animals like if i see an animal that s similar to yours i m like lizzy s somewhere loving her dogs right now i do be loving on them A A all right i think we can sneak in one more okay what are you what are you proudest of us for getting through together what nothing our big friendship hiccup no what i can t say you ll have to edit it out yeah i mean being on the internet is tough getting through the internet together i would say i ll say it so you have the perfect edit pickup i m proudest of us for getting through the internet together yeah i mean sometimes it can be challenging yeah it s a hard thing to stay authentically yourself when it feels as though the world is coming at you and i guess i am eternally grateful for you that even in our darkest of times on the internet when it wasn t okay to be associated with us you stuck right by me if anyone said anything to you about it you would stick up on my behalf you never like wavered on how you felt about me no i know you i wouldn t A A around with a bad person but i m saying that s like rare to rare in that moment like not many people made it through that moment you haven t seen my ryan expose videos well sometimes she will threat like if i piss her off she ll jokingly be the truth about ryland adams coming and i m like hold on let me screenshot some things myself A A it s always joking of course is it all right you guys thank you so much for hanging oh my gosh we re gon na run out of time again A A fun was had by all wow we were having so much fun we forgot to exit out the show um all right you guys thank you so much for enjoying hopefully another edition of the sip let us know if you like episodes that are structured differently than the norm i feel like we did something different today we hit the ground running it was dangerous sprinting i don t know if it was great tumbling but hopefully uh you found some pleasure inside of it uh if you want to follow us on social media i hope that you were able to blow your load inside of this episode i wonder if anyone s ever done that to our podcast like while they re listening have you ever jacked off to our podcast i don t think ever to a podcast in general that um do you uh i m gon na i m gon na overshare okay when i lived in an apartment with a lot of people and i would i wanted privacy while i was jacking off and i didn t have headphones i would put on a really loud show on my tv like doogie houser or something just go at it but then i met this guy who was in dookiehouser and he came on in the episode and it ruined everything what happens though if they think you re just watching tv all these people that are around you and just bust through the door that s the other thing that i thought was like do they know that like doogie houser means i m jacking off because that s A A weird do they think i m jacking off to doogiehouser because i m not that s just for my privacy you know what i mean that s my white noise all right you guys well don t forget to follow us on social media at the sip official we re also on there personally go subscribe to lizzy s youtube channel because this might be the one and only video i ever post let s see how hard you go for it i m putting no pressure on it if i fail there s no pressure on this we re all gon na laugh let s celebrate the wins and hopefully it s just that uh thank you guys so much for hanging around with us we ll see you next week and love you very much goodbye and that s the zip wow what a scary thing Music you
Music thank you Applause Music thank you we made it what are the next words no idea does anyone know seen one take what marker what if by an act of God Chris s slate literally had the next words already written on it wasn t him for like my own studies fortune telling the next conspiracy videos about Chris good morning hi it s A A raining so we re gon na be a little gremlin hello hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of the Sip I m Ryland Adams of course joined by Lizzie Gordon yeah this is A A wild it s so hard to be a person in this gray house it s so hard to exist in L A where it s snowing girl it is not snowing these A A news reporters I know like okay Northern California Big Bear yeah you re getting some snow but these people that are reporting live from the Hollywood Sign can eat my A A dick that was very impressive but is it actually snowing there was like a little bit of hell that turned into like a tiny bit of snow and there was like the slightest covering on the ground and the lady s like it s really accumulating and then shut up and then she s like trying to interview the people that are like walking up the street and they re all tourists because they re just here to see the Hollywood sign and they re like I don t know I don t live here and she s like this is crazy huh and I just I it was so funny to see how over dramatized the snow was like the rain was wild did you get the flash flood warnings oh my gosh yes so I ve gotten them multiple times here and it s like not raining you know what I mean so sometimes I m like uh how do I gauge this like how do I gauge the danger of this flashlight it was so aggressive it s like stay in immediate Place only leave if you re evacuating due to danger and it s like what right and I had a film festival to go to so I went and I drove through A A three feet of water to get onto the freeway are you okay no I m not okay I m not okay it was A A terrifying I m really uh now scared of hydroplaning can you just take that in do you know how much three feet is yeah it s a lot no it s a lot yeah it s a lot that and I felt it with every A A move my card made and then immediately no it didn t go like that because it was so deep I had to slow down but if you stop you stall out in your engine floods so you re slow driving I m slow driving through it having a full blown meltdown started seeping I didn t know what to do like I was I have my friend Mal and her husband in the back seat and Oscar s just like keep going keep going like literally I haven t felt that kind of anxiety and it s like that kind of anxiety triggers gnarly laughter for me so the toxic A A inside is like do this all the time three feet is like enough to swim dude it was terrifying it on that stomach yeah paddling when you play Murder did that and then my immediately my check engine light went on I was like I guess that s it for the Prius we got home because we were out filming and I have so many trees tree branches yeah trees like there was a full blown tree that just fell in front of the exit gate like you couldn t exit the house because a full blown tree had fallen down so dramatic branches everywhere Chris was here filming we were filming for Shane s main Channel and uh right when he like went to leave the garage the biggest gust of wind ever happened and we re like maybe you should just stay the night because it was A A crazy did you stay the night no no he braved it he braved it you go to your apartment did you go to Bakersfield my apartment there was no way you could have drove into Bakersfield no I actually don t think we could have I think the the five was i was closed I think because like a grapevine there s probably legit snow up there well the five like fully flooded by Burbank yeah and fully flooded like those cars that was more than three feet even at my apartment like when I got out of the car I just like stepped into like a mini River do you know what I mean like my my up until my ankles were covered in water when I stepped out of my car in my parking lot and now he s a prepared man with rain boots looks so good today he s got these rain boots on that are so stylish all I can think about is bread and butter but what it s I don t think it s related do wait like actual bread and butter yeah I can t stop thinking about it I ve been thinking about it since I woke up this morning when it s freezing that s just what you want yeah hmm my weekend was horrible oh why no like legit I as you would say I was having mentee bees for like a full blown like how many bees hours why could not get out of the worst mood of my life was it validated or were you just in a mood to me it felt validated well what was it called like on Thursday I snapped my back out of place oh you know that s a A A us old girls we can not function with those snapbacks no and I ve learned I was like you snap your back you go to the chiropractor yeah I went right to the chiropractor because I was like oh no we re filming for Shane tomorrow I want to be able to move because it s at the point where like any movement s like oh God and so I go to the chiropractor and I was like Wow sometimes when I go to yoga towards the end of a back thing it like snaps me back into place and I feel as good as new yeah I don t think you re supposed to work out right after the chiropractor no so I went to a yoga class immediately after I went to the chiropractor I went to more of like a stretch one like a less intense workout but a more focused on stretching and I think I A A it up even more and so all weekend long I like have not been able to move and I ve just been like in a pissed off State because when your like body feels like that the littlest of things just make you yeah lose your mind I get it and that cat won t stop peeing on my beautiful rug and I couldn t get the first piss stain out of the beautiful rug I went to the store and I tried everything I Googled and I tried all of the solutions hydrogen peroxy Don peroxide Dawn dish soap baking soda I literally tried every concoction the internet recommends yeah nothing worked I tried the white distilled vinegar and then I tried every pet stain remover on the market and for some reason because my back was hurting so bad I was so hyper focused on it I couldn t let it go and I m just sitting there like relentlessly scrubbing for hours and Shane s like you ve got to stop this is so toxic yeah we ll just turn the rug around and so I finally convince him to turn the rug around and there s a A A pee stain on the other side of the rug that we must have already hidden once when before here s what can I uh there s there s a couple questions I have for him okay get a washable rug well so that s what we re doing we we took that rug out and Shane s like that s it we have five animals we re gon na have kids we re doing ruggable yeah so we ordered a ruggable rug and I m done with these A A bougie rugs yeah a ton yeah the other thing I want to say is I read in the comment section on our podcast last week you need like two or three litter boxes I ve taken action okay I ve given another litter box in the house there s now two massive litter boxes Louie is a hungry A A so I ve given him his own free feeding food station okay and everything s been a lot better I also ordered some spray that deters animals from peeing on rugs because I still have some other rugs in the house but right when I sit down and like get over my A A anger I look up and my whole blind and wall is drenched in water stop you and I like oh the world s really testing me because we just paid so much money to have the roof done and I guess they didn t cover one of the edges so now the rain was leaking through one of the edges of the roof and it s in the room with the really high ceiling so it s coming all the way down from the roof feet of A A drywall and then they re gaslighting me once they come out it was I spent my whole Sunday fighting with this company they are coming out and now they re doing replacing the drywall but that s a whole nother week of hell of them inside of my house and like the roof was exterior it was loud but it was whatever this is they re in the house and I have to put my five animals somewhere while they re in here redoing the drywall and getting all the A A A A out of the wall and replacing it Jesus can you take the five animals somewhere and just stay somewhere else maybe I don t know throw them in the G wagon with all that I m so blessed you know yeah these are all like I no I really do have to take a step back and be like even though these small things are frustrating in the moment like I m so beyond blessed and it s like at least you can fix it they re so minuscule in the grand scheme of things and it s just like I need to take a step back I took a little bath I meditated and I was like you know what live easy brother just live easy nothing s gon na A A with my piece today I said nothing s going to A A with puppies today I slipped in a massive pile of piss and hit the ground so hard that my toes bent backwards and nail polish was taken off and my toe over here started bleeding inside of your house yeah slipped in a puddle of piss Joe had stepped in it so he was like having a conniption God and in like my codependence I was like I can t have him being this mad in my space I m gon na just help him clean it off so I m like rushing to help shut this A A year old man up and then like my haste should bring him his wet towelette I slip in the initial piss pile and it s like literally I slipped so hard the A A nail polish flew off my toes they re A A bleeding I A A busted my knee open and then Joe s like I died and I just went shut the A A up I started crying but that threw my back out and I noticed that this morning at Orange Theory that my hips all A A up because we are old like you pointed out and it traveled up my body what is it about the rain I seriously think the rain brings about demons in my life and you re so attached to my life that it like also haunts you dude it was actually this is actually so I don t know if I told you this but I realized recently like I get sympathy hangovers and I get sympathy Rich Laughter because a couple people in my life has recently come into like huge money and it s like I m rich it s like no the A A you re not wait how are they coming into huge amounts of money A girlfriend of mine just got a check for a settlement yeah yeah and I noticed that like I did a lot of creeping on you this weekend because you like looked so cute going to a birthday party thank you and I was like damn oh that s another friend yeah I go to that party I m like oh no I m loaded it s like so yes you

kit um he wrote you re getting your cards replaces a nightmare but like we all know that no it s it s a bigger A A nightmare to get your credit cards and your whatever cards replaced at Bank of America more so now than A A ever because apparently people were fraudulently going in and and stealing people s bank information with like fake IDs or whatever to get the temporary cards and I rely on those temporary cards as a dumb A A who throws her wallet away like twice a year and because if if I throw that away I need I can t not have access to my money right you know that s crazy for however many days it takes to get your cards they still haven t sent my business card and it s been over a week so anyway I go and get my temporary card they go oh we don t do that anymore I go okay well how do I I can t just cancel my cards and have no access to money did you deposit a shitload of cash is Cash falling out of your pockets no because also like I m gon na lose that you know I can t walk around with cash I throw my A A wallet away so I was just like okay well I guess we ll replace one card and then we ll replace the other and the one that I didn t need actually like because I so I keep my personal card uh turned on and I just get a replacement so I can keep using it on my phone right and then I canceled my business card and asked for it to be sent to my house the A A card that I don t actually need gets sent to my house and I still don t have the business card so I can t cancel this card because I still won t have another card and are you checking to see if people are spending on it I am they re not I definitely threw my wallet away I threw my passports away once upon a time so I can t find my password my wallet is definitely the number one thing I lose daily yeah but I am going to return the wallet I got for Joe and get a girly version of it okay for me I like that I do too I thought about just using the one I got and I was like this is so masculine it looks like it wasn t for me right yeah yeah we re trying to choose who s going to be our parents if uh our if something were to happen to us before the babies are born oh wow that s because we re doing legal and so like before like they sent us the legal contract and now we re reviewing it and he s like a couple of things you got ta answer like who s gon na be the parents in the event that you both die before the kids are born what s so Joe and I were talking about this this weekend and it s like you always pick the person where you know if they died they wouldn t want you to have your kids because they re better than you anything like you always pick someone who s a little bit better than you to have your kids in case of your death but you know for a fact they d never be like oh I don t want Lizzy to have my baby I have some suggestions for you do you need them or have you pick yeah you can give me your suggestions do you want me to do it on error privately no go on air for sure Austin well that is kind of my first choice yeah also takes care of all of us I haven t asked him yet so Stacy s gon na hear this first before I ask you raise these babies dude raise these babies yeah in worst case scenario for Shane and I s love and they re raising this baby right now Laughter yeah cause it s like rude to put it on my parents like they ve already had enough kids like my grandma lives with my mom so like it would be too mean to like be like here s a new baby right which Austin but like he s young he has a house he has a job oh I I as a person who barely speaks to Austin thinks I think he would love it okay what s your last of us beef before we get into our hot toppies are you caught up on the episodes I ve fallen off the train I keep thinking we re gon na go back we re gon na go back but I haven t gone back and see so here s my maybe like not so popular opinion I don t really give a A A about this show I think I fell off too I I want to A A the A A out of Pedro Pascal because everybody does that came up at the party someone brought him up they re like he s so hot and I was like yeah everybody wants to A A him and Joe was like is that your way of you say you want to A A him I was like yeah I said everybody are you listening what s his status in life Pedro yeah no idea but I m single married straight gay it feels like he s looking for me honestly if that s what I think he s up to I m not gon na look too much further into it because I like it as is um so I m watching because I care about him as a person has it developed a lot more no every there is it s like it s all a stunted development because every episode the new development dies and then they re just spoiling it who A A cares never need to go back you re never going back anymore I m never going back because it was something I was like oh Shane and I can watch this together but then we re like it s not the right thing to watch while you re eating dinner and then after dinner it s like I want to watch something like Housewives right I mean at any rate I will say spoilers ahead no I don t okay can you spoil it without spoiling it try your hardest okay so here s my beef with it this most recent episode we go back to Elle s origin story is that the daughter yeah no yeah it s okay it s the day them she s come out as a day then she s better than the whole time is it not great to say she s benedatham there are they them there are they we re learning there are they them has they yeah she they talked about it I believe they I m not trying to be mean I m not trying to like be really bad I just I don t remember in the show that ever being no I m talking about the person in real life oh okay okay that s completely different from what I was well it s part of the character as well because they wear a chest binder okay anyway this is her their origin story and wait in real life for the show you re gon na show the show okay they re Blended okay anyway we re in a mall right and if we re looking at the timeline of this show the outbreak happened in like or something right okay which means that and then in another episode they say we re years into this mess so if this child is A A years old she has never known normalcy of the world okay and it s not like they have music because it s a bleak A A existence which they ve established they don t have TV they don t have movies she s basically like a sewer rat who has no parents also so nobody has told them what the A A life used to be like okay this whole episode is these two kids who are or to who have never been alive during a normal time period being in a mall feeling nostalgic listening to s music and playing arcade games but like there s not a chance in A A hell that a post apocalyptic kid is gon na run into a mall and be like I A A with Mortal Kombat heavy you know what I mean like they don t know they don t know they would they like turn a carousel on prepare it and they re just like knowing exactly what the A A a carousel does but it s like no one told you what the A A a carousel was how did you know to turn that on you can t just suspend your reality for a second not this heavily and then the other thing that s A A irritating is like it s got s Nostalgia music playing but it s like if anything were to be playing in this mall it would be whatever was playing on a loop in right not the A A s song that the writer is obsessed with because the writer came of age in the s and the writer A A played Mortal Kombat okay now she s dragging the Creator and I love the creators I listen to the creators podcast every day for five years of my A A life really yeah huge Craig Mason fan huge John August fan and to be completely honest Craig I think you ve sucked a little bit too hard on your own dick and I mean that with every fiber of my being sir respectfully I love your work you taught me most of the things I know and you got ta chill out a little bit bro I m shook I know it s a big I mean I m tired you know I m tired I was everything s fine when you re tired I was up late I m cranky I slipped in pissed I m like not you know it s when it is what it is so we re allowed to be nasty I did an improv show with Jason Alexander last night so I m like a big deal the guy who broke into Britney s house at our wedding just kidding it s the guy from Seinfeld wait what though what you wouldn t know any of these things so don t worry about it okay I hope they did they well you were with the criminal last night no you know what I m talking about right Chris Chris knows oh okay moving on all right let s get into some hot topics this headline made me cackle out loud because it was just a hyperlink so I couldn t see it Lizzy had put it in the document I click on it and it s like criminal how hard I was laughing at just the headlines read the headline baby Alaska woman gets kicked in head by a moose while walking her dog but it was just like the headline with the Bold text and then the photo right below it that just like sent me out of this atmosphere because it was like what the A A so what s what I think is particularly funny about this is the first place I saw it was on Tick Tock of course because it was this family is in their truck and they re driving down the street at night in Alaska and of course she just happens to be recording no she pulled out her phone to record because there s just a moose who s walking down the street instead of like honking like a A A crazy person saying like watch out there s a moose she s like no you re loose is on the loose literally that s what she s doing and one of her kids is in the back seat and goes yo shouldn t we give that woman walking a heads up she s like and then literally this is the Walker and this is the moose and the woman goes look out hey look out after the kids like yo should we give her a heads up she s like yes look at it it s crazy to me when these people that record these things become the hero of their own stories when they re like exploiting somebody to go viral on social media I don t think she was trying to go viral on it I don t think she was connecting the dots that this moose that was running full steam no I I don t know when your first instinct is to pull out and gently record instead of being like hey A A watch the A A out it seems like you have an intention to post like I had also seen this story on like inside edition where like this year old woman was working as a pizza delivery lady yeah and she like got to the store or got to this person s door the nest camera caught it she like fell and really biffed it hard yeah I saw that poor woman s like A A and works for Domino s and she just eats A A so hard we re gon na get in trouble for this one no because they started it all turned out fine they started to GoFundMe for her and they raised like hundreds of thousands of dollars quit your job and they let her quit her job and retire so all was good in the end and she wasn t like hurt in any crazy way I just think it s the end of my story I ll be delivering a pizza I ll eat A A and whatever crowdfunding is available at the time will help me into retirement but it just felt like even that then the family that posted the nest footage like recorded them being like giving her the hundreds of thousands of dollars and it just like gives me the ick a little bit because it s like it like are you doing this for attention or are you doing it to actually help change This Woman s life in this scenario I could see the update being valuable to those who contributed and loved this woman yes I do agree but in other instances like I see people all the time like go like they re only acclaimed to social media Fame is them giving huge tips to people but that s not their own money they raise these money on crowdfunding sites themselves to go tip strangers right and that s how they get a following so it s like that that you know sure it s icky but it s still great for that server yeah yeah but then there s also the dark side of this where there a few years ago there was like a homeless man who this couple raised like four hundred thousand dollars for and they just never gave it to him what they just A A him and they re like well he probably isn t gon na have the means to see it I think they did get in trouble legally because it s fraud right yeah yeah uh back to this moose thing I thought it was interesting I don t know anything about mooses but this moose was just jaunting along and then just wax the person with one arm and then keeps running straight up Duck s a A A in the head like wouldn t you think oh my biggest fear is getting attacked by a mountain lion and they like attack me and then they re like eating me from the inside out right it s like a prolonged event whereas the moose was just like keep it moving yeah yeah which reminds me you deleted my Jake Paul fight no I moved it because you put it two places on the document oh my bad but that moose was throwing fists like Jake you know what I m saying Jake wants to lean back a little bit get real A A far back and then he just throws a Haymaker hahaha he s probably laughing all the way to the bank how much do you think he made for that fighting I think you still win money oh good good well if it s like a pay per view thing he s getting paid x amount to show up I don t know if it goes I think he produced the fight too wow did you didn t watch it no what I I watched it you did yeah you were with people that wanted to watch it yeah I wanted to watch it you wanted to watch grown men fight yo here s another unpopular opinion on this episode of let s cancel Lizzie Gordon just keep adding them up tally him in the comment section at this point I don t even care to cut A A out I m just like Let Her Go my back hurts so I m just gon na let things happen so I think the Paul brothers are like super inspiring laughs I don t know how bad that sounds I mean the toxic thing to say the way that they were able to turn like a good YouTube presence yeah into like mainstream all every dude in America like A A over you also like pretty incredible the like as a person who lightly Vlogs once a week and can t believe how much effort it takes and I put like no effort into it do you know what I m saying yeah like I will my vlog s at most six hour Endeavors this isn t a good like sell for your Vlog Channel right now no but it s like that s all I can put into it right you know what I mean and they did it every A A day at a very high energy level editing very well edited very well and on top of that you see these boys and it s like they re that that s a version of acting they re playing to Their audience in that and it is a A A demoralizing character to play you know what I m saying like that is awful that must have been psychologically really A A hard yeah and then not only that but they have the tenacity to capitalize on other influencers and take coin from them as well like oh my God but more than any of this I m not like this isn t even why I think they re inspired sure it s low key evil what they do what I am inspired by it s like I heard Logan talking I think on Jeff FM about his like work ethic and he s like talking to Jeff and he s like Jeff but if you know your brand man you got ta lean into your brand and it s not just about your brand right now it s like what can you grow it to be this is your job do your A A job to the best of your ability and imagine what you could have by from doing that if only I could take that on advice on this podcast I mean I take that advice in like other aspects of my life yeah yeah and it s like it s just the way that they like rise and grind is A A impressive the work ethic is very impressive yeah I mean they re up working out all day every day they re working all day every day and it s like damn sure they take time off to have some pill addiction issues but like who doesn t you know no I just mean like a few of the things that like even the name of their A A companies like rise and be original I think about that sometimes and I m like yeah I will do that I am original I am there s nobody who s as stupid as I am you know what I mean I can lean into that I m gon na be I m gon na name my daughter Maverick you know what I mean I yeah I ll stop but I was watching the fight thinking like he s leaning back a lot I enjoyed it I had a good time sorry I love like your admiration love for them but then like harsh critique at the same time it s really great yeah okay so Addison Ray is set to star in a new horror movie Thanksgiving opposite Patrick Dempsey yeah a group of survivors fighting zombie like creatures and an action thriller about a stunt man targeting victims with his killing machine car no you mixed up two different movies there okay so this is uh the stunt car thing that you were just talking about is actually from a movie called Grindhouse that inspired this movie right so Grindhouse very confusing I got very bored I m trying to explain it too so in grind house there were a bunch of different like um what are they called movie trailers that were created for fake movies and this is one of them oh and their mate and Eli Roth is making it and does he make other popular horror movies yes he does he def yes he makes good for Addison Ray I mean honestly good I can t hate a hustle and this girl has really made something of herself doobie hustling I don t think she s I don t have a big heart for her as a person who just stood here defending the Paul Brothers I I have I it weighs heavy on my conscious what This Woman s had to deal with in regards to her like families siphoning off the fame like her dad and her mom are kind of like fame s an ugly thing and money s an ugly thing as well yeah I find it inspiring personally because like myself me being me like not the greatest actor in the world this gives me hope like after her Netflix movie debuted at number one Netflix then signed a deal with her for her to produce and star in two more Netflix films does she want to make our Christmas movie hopefully wow she could you should play me you know you d be really good at the producer role A A you she s in two scenes and has three lives make our dreams come true Madison baby go red so I just think good honor you know yeah good for her is she still tick tocking I don t know I had to delete The Tick Tock app I know what well I was trying to edit my Vlog this weekend and I d filmed a majority of it all of it on my phone and was trying to transfer the footage from my phone to my computer and it wouldn t do it because it wouldn t download from the cloud because my phone was full so I was like you know what Tick Tock is toxic I m gon na delete it and then last night before bed I downloaded it again like a A A crackhead it s like I need like me in my s when I was addicted to Grindr I kept saying goodbye and I kept coming back goodbye goodbye goodbye wow yeah back though uh Lady Gaga gets sued for not giving reward to dog thief yeah can you believe that no I actually can t and the more that I would spiral down into this story it s crazy uh this lady let s give the backstory first for those of you that have forgotten a few years ago Lady Gaga s dog walker was walking her three French Bulldogs when he was shot in the A A chest multiple times and the dogs were kidnapped so he survived and I think he was able to hold on to one of the dogs too actually which is like A A wild so they Jack these two French Bulldogs This Guy s in the hospital recovering Lady Gaga says I will give no questions asked to any person who who returns returns these dogs to me or helps AIDS in the return of my dogs and this A A comes out of the Woodworks and she s like so funny I found these dogs which is crazy because I wasn t following like it was so long ago that I had to like reread and from what I gathered this morning it s this woman was friends with the guy that stole the dogs knew he stole the dogs and went and stole the dogs from him to then give back to Lady Gaga but then she was it turned around that she was then an accomplice in stealing the dogs in the first place but her giving them back she was like because there s no questions asked I was supposed to get the five hundred thousand dollars yeah A A you A A I wonder though if in a court of law she ll win I don t know like if Lady Gaga posted I mean it s so morally corrupt and A A twisted in every way like the the karma that this girl is gon na face is gon na be who knows near death yeah I mean I hope she chokes on her own spit and dies I mean that yeah you re a A A A A you re a A A A A you re gon na steal someone s dogs shoot someone in the chest steal their A A dogs and what lawyer would take this on a A A A A like a A A A A let s get gaga yeah who s this lawyer I don t know I hope this A A is filing her on paperwork too so she has to go through that A A hell as well I wonder if this will escalate to a point where like Lady Gaga will have to go to court or if she ll settle which would be so like can you imagine having to settle I would never I would never I just don t know you re gon na have to pull that money from my A A fingertips and then also I might shoot you in the chest I just don t know from like I don t know the law obviously right so I don t know from that standpoint if her sign was you get five hundred thousand dollars for returning the dogs no questions asked does that mean she gets five hundred thousand dollars I don t know it s not like a legally binding statement she didn t like sign a contract with like whoever is returning the dogs I mean I don t know I know that there s like I don t remember the actual like you know case law about all of this but there are there is a lot of history in it because there are police officers who will pose as a person buying drugs to get a drug dealer so to some degree this is similar to that you could argue that and no matter what it s like A A you dude also stop stealing dogs stop it what do you like you think you re gon na make money breeding them you re not these dogs don t have papers you re not going to make the same A A coin off of them and you re not going to do it well so all you re doing is ruining a A A dog s life who s really happy with their family but also and ruining a family s life who s A A stop who s gon na buy Lady Gaga s stolen talk you know well sometimes I think it s more about breeding them so they ll steal a dog so they can breed the dog because this person was targeting Lady Gaga because they re Lady Gaga s dogs honestly no I just don t know yeah I don t know what the marketing Ploy would be inside of that like you can t Market I don t think it had anything to do with Lady Gaga because stealing French Bulldogs is such a A A problem right it s like it s such a problem that like we don t want icky in the front of our house anymore looking out the windows and like we took him for a walk on Christmas in Publix because he loves people like that was his Christmas present and we bumped into another woman she s like oh I have a friendship I don t bring my Frenchie here and we were like I know and she s like stay strapped like that s how we talk to each other wow and it s when I walk the dogs I walk them in my running shoes and I ve trained them now like bubs we re running you know what I mean let s go how fast can you go so that we can run if we have to like we my husband and I like practice like I have a plan if I feel unsafe I just start running I don t give a A A if I look stupid I just start running and then the other thing is like you know we we talked about like plans like don t be embarrassed just start screaming bloody murder knocking on all the doors because no matter what like I can t let them take my dog yeah you know what I mean especially because like he has he has such a good life with us and I love him so much and I would rather I I mean I would rather him be hit by a car than taken by someone who s just gon na put him in a A A cage and try to breed him yeah and that s also something that s starting to stress me out about like the breeding websites that I look at because the one that I I we got him from like we got him from a great family like there s literally inspirational quotes on the puppy s walls and I swear to God icky is the sweetest boy because he came from a really sweet home where it s a family they love these dogs they love these puppies they stay in touch with every family that gets one of their dogs and um I see on now these these websites that these dogs are going for like twenty three thousand dollars and the ones that go for twenty three thousand dollars I know like a bunch of people go in on buying it because it s an investment and I know that dog is just going to be used for breeding that s so sick and it yeah it bums me the A A out and it s like I mean I don t know it has to be it s like there s so much compassion and love that has to go into the to life making specifically for like a puppy or a dog because dogs are just the purest sweetest most loving so it it really bums me out to see like a like fluffy Frenchie getting bought by like five people who are posting pictures on Instagram with it getting ready to breed them when they re six months old and there s no way to stop it like it s not illegal by any means um that s no and that s the thing that so like the website I use they do random checking on breeders houses so they won t feature you as a breeder on their page if you re you know Shady right but they don t really look at the buyers like I wanted to face time with icky s family so that I could know where he was coming from before I picked him up and they didn t want to see us they don t give a A A as long as your car as long as your cash clears I mean they give a A A because they stay in touch and we like text and send pictures on Instagram and all those things like they know his name all these things right but um I don t know if they they met with every family right you know it s harder to rescue a dog from wagmore than it was for me to buy icky yeah and I think to some degree they the price sort of weeds out some of the riffraff but I also see like that demon that demon Frenchie in New York is back up for adoption because the family that got him initially couldn t train him or take care of him and then the woman who adopted him afterwards returned to him I don t know what that demon dog is but uh there s a demon dog in New York who s a really cute friendship and I might go get him because he s been returned after being adopted again okay Brian Cox slams session co star Jammy Jeremy Strong s method acting is annoying this is so funny I guess Jeremy Strong on the set of succession once he shows up to set he stays in his character he s like full blown method acting he s like all the way there the entire time and Brian Cox is like Jeremy s gifted but he will not lose his talent by embodying his character off screen he goes on to say he doesn t have to be a big A A religion it doesn t have to be a big A A religious experience and then the reporter said well what s it like being around somebody who s always in character and he said oh it s A A annoying don t even get me going on it it s about it because it s like it must be A A annoying it must be awful I Met Sally Field right after Lincoln and Daniel Day Lewis is famously a method actor and like she and her son were all A A up at this like after party for the Globes because she was on doing like the award circuit that year and they were always and they re like it s so A A annoying I had the sun s like I would go see my mom and I had to call this A A guy Mr President oh the A A it was the best night of my life it was so sick I just I mean I got it s a whole another level I know like Jim Carrey like famously did you ever watch the Andy Kaufman documentary on Netflix I watched the documentary and I saw the movie when it came out and you know I love it man on the moon he plays Andy Kaufman and Andy Kaufman was like famously obnoxious but Jim apparently while filming that movie like did not break character like there s footage of him like crashing cars into like the studio sound stages yeah and he s like he he s saying like the character doesn t want Jim to come out and he s like just staying full blown there the entire time and now Jim even present day when he s like doing the like confessionals for this documentary that they made about him being a method actor for that movie he s just like sitting there like yeah Universal didn t want any of this footage to get out because they thought everyone would think I m an A A but I don t care I mean they do now anyway everyone thinks he s an A A yeah Jim s had like a rough few years I mean he s so talented he s recently like garnered a little bit of his like Hollywood love back but there was like a period there where everyone was like A A him but he s so talented he s so tired I mean I don t know what he did other like was he just like generally kind of rude to people or just like in his own lane not like I could be wrong but I think it s pretty dark okay yeah because I do feel like there is a certain element of when somebody gets very successful I understand an element of them wanting to do their job efficiently which means not like stopping to talk and check in on everyone s feelings all the time it s like I m here to do a job as much as I have a great job that s fun and entertaining I m not like here to be everyone s emotional support or make you feel validated in your job role in this production I can be polite and I don t have to have a conversation right now yeah and I think that s where a lot of these huge actors get a lot of beef because like they like help the help or the subordinate workers amongst them will be asked to not speak to them which I understand I get it too and if this is a big role for you if you re a big actor you re taking a movie because you think this is the right step for your career which there s a lot of pressure on choosing a right role because Hollywood s all about momentum if you lose momentum you won t get the roles you once had so it s like I m preparing to do a huge A A monologue I don t want all the crew members telling me they loved me in this movie or like bringing me away from what I m thinking about talking to me about anything yeah I m I m I ve got to focus I hate when Joe comes in the room and I m writing just says nothing to me I m like okay he s like oh am I bothering you it s like yes yes you are I love you so much I love you so much but yes you are and see and that s the person you love most yeah so imagine a stranger like literally didn t want to come here today I just wanted to cuddle with him and the dogs and I it s like don t don t talk to me he s like you never listen it s like you why why would I listen to you right now you just interrupted me but um I mean I don t let either of you talk to me before this show no he literally oh my God you say it I don t yeah you said don t talk to me it s not because I don t like you guys I just don t want it yet I mean man I just got so hot so hot ding I was gon na see something I completely forgot most recently was Austin Butler obviously who just like can t kick his character which I think is in the long term gon na affect his future roles because if he s giving me the X if casting directors can only see you as that even in your real life it s like how am I gon na cast Elvis you know yeah he s giving me the ick all right well Paris Hilton s family didn t know about her son who we now know is named Phoenix do we do we already talk about this on the podcast well we talked about his name we didn t talk about her recent that was before she posted a photo with him right and now she s revealed that none of her family even knew that she had a surrogate pregnant until a week after the child was born and in their lives could you imagine Keeping a Secret like that no I tell everyone on the internet every step of my journey I would die I think because I mean I would internally combust I couldn t talk to anyone I would have to fake my own death like because like honestly if that s and then it s like a double reveal surprise and a baby this is like a trend now I people are showing up at their family like non famous people are showing up at their family s houses with A A babies in crates here s and they ll do the whole announcement and then they ll be like guess what here she is and then the parents of these parents are like what okay the dark and twisted part of me is like do you think if Paris even told any of her family members like well what if her mom said it to like one of her sisters and then her sisters and then it gets out and it leaks and then her like big baby reveal is like I m not saying that s what she did but like Paris Hilton loves a good press moment so like the toxic part of me is like maybe she didn t tell her family for that reason or maybe it s people protecting themselves from heartbreak because I think to like if something didn t go right or if you ve let everyone in on your journey and then you also have to live the Heartbreak with everyone and have everyone coming at you with questions or sympathy I think there is a large element of celebrity that probably just doesn t want to deal with that heartbreak publicly and I I totally get that and I think about that sometimes like if I m if I m going to continue to Vlog through my fertility Journey the most annoying part of it is my mom and Joe s mom watching these podcasts and then discussing amongst themselves instead of calling and talking to me you know what I mean you re also more so just like you want the in person attention rather than than them I don t even want that but I definitely don t want them talking amongst themselves as if this is the actual information do you know what I m saying but the but the are you saying you re lying on the podcast no but I m like I don t want my close family members to think that this is a form of communication with me right like you got to talk to me you know what I m saying right this is this is not a conversation you know like this do you know what I mean you just feel like sometimes they can watch you for an hour and be like I know what s going on with Lizzy this oh literally they re like well I was gon na call and then I watched your podcast and they just decided not to and it s like okay that s A A fine A A but um but more than anything it s like I think about that like what if I can t have a baby and then I ve put it all out there but then I remember like you know if there is anything to pain and suffering it s that if my pain and suffering can be relatable to somebody else who s in pain and suffering and that alleviates a little bit of pain for both of us I think that s a beautiful thing and that but that s different from being a celebrity actor it s a little more specific to our jobs and what we ve chosen to do and how we ve chosen to put ourselves out there I think YouTubers uh find people that watch them because they relate to their vulnerability or what they go through in their life good or bad so I think yeah as like YouTubers it is a learning moment like when the worst things in my life have happened and I talk about it on YouTube not only do I feel like I get support I gain knowledge I get to let it out and it s like this beautiful even with like the cat thing people are like you need another litter box and I look into it I m like I need another litter box yeah you know and that s something surface level and silly but I mean for me it s the necessity to do something instead of just wallow yeah and I think that that s I think that s good for everybody I think it can be good for everybody involved I think you can become toxic if you don t have the right like there s a boundaries yeah being exploitive exploitative of your own life and people and things in your life versus like sharing for a purpose or a reason or a greater cause yeah yeah yeah good on her for being able to keep that secret though I couldn t real sneaky I have to tell like I we get every update with this journey for us and I m like calling my mom you know she s like shut up I heard it on the pod um I think we should probably just get into advice right advice though yeah you don t want what was this um I talked about that and then the wedding thing oh you don t want to talk about the wedding I mean you can if you want because I thought that was a great idea for a movie okay talk about it I mean I ll hold it close to my chest but I thought it d be a great concept for a contained film okay well let us in on the story no because then everyone else is gon na make the movie oh my gosh you re such a A A team you know Craig Mason s listening right now and you know he s like I wonder what Lizzy s gon na make that movie about he s never casting you in anything or working with you fine I don t want to be casting his thing wow I m busy vlogging for five people who won t take my calls anymore it s fine let s get into some advice though Ryland is titled this by girl in relationship with you you re not supposed to read my titles it s just so you know if you want to do it or not hi Rylan and Lizzy hi girl hey I would really appreciate some advice on my relationship my boyfriend and I both have been together for three years and I love him very much leave him stop it this is the healthiest relationship I ve ever had and I can see us spending our lives together I m bisexual but have never been in any sort of relationship with a woman and my only worry is that I will regret never exploring that side of myself and possibly end up resenting my boyfriend or our relationship I don t want to throw away something so special to me but it feels like I m closing off a part of myself and all advice appreciated sending love to you all especially Chris who s just the sweetest wow oh wow um I don t my personal feeling is uh I mean I don t know I m not bi so I can t speak to the want to explore or having never explored regrets but I can say that if you are in for me a forever relationship means that there s no sexual stray but that s me you know I would say because you re uh it sucks because you re at a point in your life where this is a healthy relationship you like him a lot everything s going well the problem is I do fear like your concern of being maybe having kids and then still feeling the strong urge to explore something you never got to do I would say love has a weird way of working itself out what s meant to be will be I would be very honest with my boyfriend and I d say listen I love you so much this is the healthiest relationship I ve ever been in I m having these feelings and see if you guys can come to some sort of something together on your own whether that s like okay let s take six months and reevaluate let s break up let s explore I mean I couldn t do a third party in my relationship but I m just saying I do think you re doing a disservice to yourself if you don t not only bring this up to him but try for yourself and I think if you re thinking about it enough to write us about it it s something you re heavily considering or needing to do I know that when I needed to hook up with a guy to kind of confirm why I felt off for so long like questioning why I wasn t like taking to the girls that were initially like throwing themselves at me like I could tell like you can tell when somebody s into you and I like my best friends in high school would be like what are you doing like why aren t you executing this this is like like this girl s all into it and I m just like I don t know and for a long time I thought I was crazy and then I hooked up with a guy and I was like oh everything went off and maybe if you are genuinely bi and you go both ways you can find your your way back to him but I just I I think you need to like be brutally honest with your partner and then come up with a plan for yourself yeah to extrapolate on my whole the love doesn t stray sexually thing like if you re thinking about something else or somebody else that probably means that this and just being healthy is not a reason to stay in a relationship yeah you know we we are in a day and age where we have the luxury of not just settling for healthy like you can have you can have it all you can have love you can have health you can have passion you can have all of it and um you know sometimes the perfect relationship on paper doesn t equal happiness exactly and so if you re not happy and lit on fire by this thing because you re thinking about something else so severely that it s distracting you I would say pump the brakes on this also young as A A years and that s I don t know like if you were and like engaged I d be like I d really consider and maybe like reach out to a therapist yeah um but because you re so young I a brutally honest conversation with him because this relationship is healthy yeah and then figuring out your next steps I think is ideal yeah yeah I think we did that one right yeah did we do this one no um I hope you all are doing well I m currently planning my wedding both me and my fiance are in recovery and I know Lizzy is in recovering is in recovery so I need advice I know I absolutely don t want liquor at my wedding I think I m okay with beer and wine but I m having second thoughts I have read on wedding threads though that guests can get bored if there is no alcohol Lizzy did you have alcohol at your wedding if you did did you get triggered at all if you didn t have alcohol at your wedding did your guests still have a good time I have three years sober in my fiance has four alcohol is not our drug of choice but my mother in law is saying it d be better to just not have alcohol altogether but I don t want people to be bored I honestly think me and my fiance will be fine if there is alcohol but I guess I d also just like to be prepared for anything in case anyone gets triggered I look forward to hearing from you all and love the podcast um it s your wedding don t have alcohol if you don t want alcohol if you re not happy to pay for the alcohol A A it you have a DJ there I can dance if they re bored I agree and I think if it s a concern of yours at all you should just nip it in the bud I mean obviously I m a big um cheerleader of your wedding is your day like I didn t I not that I didn t consider those closest to me but I wanted it to be about Shane and I s relationship what felt most authentic to Shane and I and the wedding s supposed to be the best day or one of the huge milestones in your life if you think there s a chance that you could be triggered by a substance at your wedding I just think it s not worth it yeah it s not worth it and it s money dude it s expensive and if you have guests that are like oh I m not gon na come because there s no alcohol or that s going to be boring they re not your real friends to begin like if you would have told me there s no alcohol at my wedding I would have been like great who cares there was alcohol at my wedding and like to be honest like I wish there wasn t I get a little bit annoyed around people who are drinking it s just it s like and it s not even because I have an alcohol problem it s because it s annoying well and I don t think like I don t think being around a blackout drunk person is mind if I have a glass of wine is when somebody is like and a lot of people at weddings do get to the point of black yeah people get wasted it s not casual drinking at a wedding it s not like we re going to dinner and I m having a glass of wine it s like I m having five cocktails I m puking in the bushes I m gon na A A my girlfriend in the bathroom like my Twisted cousin brought Coke and we re all blown out like it s not it s annoying it s A A annoying and if you re worried about people being bored instead of spinning the alcohol the budget on alcohol why don t you spend that money on like carnival games or experiences a poker table you can engage in yes because it s like you can that s a lot of money you re saving on alcohol you can hire experiences or games or anything fun I don t think I would work to please anyone else especially if you guys are going strong with three and four years of recovery yeah and it s not even about triggering your ISM it s just your day yeah and if you don t want it you don t have to have it I agree don t spend all this time to then have all this drama and especially when you re bringing all these family members together like the alcohol only like really expedites the amount of possibilities for fights or arguments or riffs yeah and like for me it s like I want to remember this day I want to remember it with my friends I don t want my friends to be like oh my God I totally forgot I did the senior wedding or like I m I was up all night drinking and forgot like are you are you cool with me doing it s like no I m not cool with any of it if you have to ask you know I m not right don t do it I say stand strong and stand strong just don t do it and live for yourself they re probably already married this has been on here for a while sorry girlfriend I hope you didn t do it ha we re the worst we are the worst um all right you guys well I guess submit your new advice questions so we can be timely uh contact the zip gmail com there s also a phone number I will leave in the descriptions uh description section and pin it in the comments uh try to leave them under seconds get straight to the point just so that we can actually share them on air um and yeah yeah it s your life you don t have to do anything you don t want to do yeah except for pay taxes all right you guys

come on in or not i ll hold my drink tray that s excessive hey says who psycho hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the sif i m ryan adams of course joined by lizzie gordon we also have chris who s currently setting up the shop because i ran in like a crazy boy oh i was going pee didn t flush the toilet what are you what is going on it was white like what what is the rush though like why are you running why did you run into this because i made a latte i didn t want to lose energy the sun setting you know i had a plan for us to be outside i wanted to be in the hot tub beautiful oh my gosh thank you chris we look gorgeous um so i wanted to be outside but then it started raining and now the cushions are wet so here we are inside again but i thought we could enjoy some nice time in nature together but it wasn t in the carts for us no we hate nature chris hello hi he was just swinging out on the swing in nature you were in nature i was really i never get to relax and that swing outside is so it s like so relaxing which is just swinging i mean i literally don t know what the A A that is what s the swing there is a tree swing right up front in the front yard do some exploring on your free time no i m not like i m gon na go lay and look at tick tocks near you while you edit this yeah it s really crazy how you can just for hours dissolve into tick tock i m so content i went out i watered my plants and then i walked back upstairs and she s still huddled in uh what s that position the fetal position position and um just watching tick tocks and and she just cackles at herself she laughs listen i m not watching tick tock who is everyone apparently gosh are there any viral tick tocks that we can discuss um yeah there s one that i think is pretty funny we could do it right now if you want well i mean i think i regret asking you this well you already did the cats out of the bag A A you ran into this moment so there s a tick tock right now where you like describe someone like they re a but they live in their mother s basement oh i ve seen this do you want to do it to each other how do you do it so i would go like i m going to do it to you okay and it might i don t know anything nasty to say about you just think i ll do chris just kidding it s because it s because people think i m mean to you think no i m just kidding well i don t know let s let the victim speak what the A A i m the victim this on this is the i m the victim on this show you said last week i was the victim i know i was being nice if anything of course chris gets the victim card now and jared gets to sleep in the bed upstairs wow lizzy is happy wow room drama honestly i texted your ass before i got on that plane and i said i demand the A A bedroom you know what s going on here the thing is because jared s blood you can say it s because jared is shane s blood brother and i m no one s blood brother so i sleep on the floor somebody left a voicemail oh gosh what say it well i feel like it doesn t do them justice if i don t play the voicemail is it nasty no he said who s he the man that left the voicemail who s the man i don t know do you want me to show you the voicemail yeah cause now i m like what is it gon na hurt my feelings because i m on edge well no you just said he s blood related oh i have it right here let s see if it works and i m really elevated from a couple of blocks um and i m just wanting to know is it just me or does anybody else think that shane s brother jared looks like ryland s mom vicki i don t know i just i was watching shane s podcast and i was looking at jared s face and like i said it could be the weed it could just be a conspiracy or coincidence i don t know but let me know what your thoughts are love you all so much bye they think that jared is vicki s son no they think that jared looks uncanny to vicky although i haven t done a comparison side by side but the implication is that he would be her son oh well that you listened to that whole thing and didn t you do you know what uncanny means i don t think that means blood related it doesn t but it s like an uncanny resemblance yeah but i just think that he s high in looking at the podcast thinking wow the two of them really look alike but don t you think that the implication of that would be that vicky is his mother no i don t think so at all and thus shane would be your brother too should we do some exploring i don t think we should be getting into this sounds like you re about to ruin your family no i don t you is so crazy um let me just look at jared really quick without the beard i can see it i wouldn t call it uncanny though okay what were we fighting about before this that led us to that oh the bedroom upstairs yeah so lizzy normally won t give me the time of day i m begging her as one of my only bffs A A kidding me no i i ask you to come don t make me screen record the amount of text messages that i send you a day that go unanswered that s because they re a lot like it s just like go on with the fact that you re reaching out to me and i m unavailable i like i i don t like phones like i like even when you call me like i love you so much but like i don t enjoy phone like i don t enjoy texting i don t enjoy phone calls that much and i do answer your phone calls but i m just saying like i would much rather spend time in person with you and so i m always asking you when you re here to stay a night so that we can wake up and go to breakfast and go work out and do friend things and then i stay a night no and then this is the first time in forever that you stay tonight you kick my ass out into the cold no jared and chris are staying for three nights oh you want to sleep over jared and chris are staying for three nights so it only makes sense that one of them sleeps in the bedroom because if you stayed in the bed tonight then i d have to change the sheets tomorrow because i have a skin fungus no i mean that s because also i think it s gone i don t know man i just checked a diet coke i feel like i need to poop but i can t like i made a latte Music and there i was going nuts because i could you stop looking at your phone with me turn that thing over unless something detrimental to our lives what is going on no i just can t see oh whenever it was like when it goes on and i m trying to like read who it is you know what lizzy and shane discovered when they walked in and bumped into each other today here let s reenact it oh do you have the same phone case okay let s try it again i don t think they need to reenact no back to one from the top oh we re gon na bump into each other Music show the phone case and shane did order that and lizzy was also wearing leopard print uh leggings and shane has been on a leopard kick let me tell you like this has come out after his birthday now but like so as we ve been watching the real housewives of beverly hills all of them have leopard print stair runners and i was like it s cute but he somehow took that as i said that we could do that in our house and i said this staircase is not in a position that that would be okay we can do it anyways no you ve walked up the stairs oh i thought it was gon na what is shane s birthday next tuesday well yesterday when this goes up okay that s good to know okay um but anyways i got a lot of leopard print things for his birthday what did you get so many cute things although i do want to say like the selection for women is much better of course but so it was tricky you have leopard printing but i made it happen i m sure you could get them a lot of really nice like summertime t shirts that are buttons up button up and leopardy and sexy well more so i want like fun adventurous ones for the podcast his podcast oh he does like a good fashion moment on that so yeah we re into the leopard right now last year was boucle this year is so leopard and that s how i m thriving um what about you what about me i heard you had an encounter while hiking this week i didn t hear i got photos and i was like wait okay it is aggressive and i need to be very clear about something i never like to photograph somebody without their consent the only other time i did it was today in the airport when i saw that french bulldog and i started filming him without the owner s consent but i saw josh peck while i was hiking again and it just feels like i like the next time i see him i m gon na have to say something he doesn t live in that area unless it s for me he s a huge A A fan of the sip so josh peck goes to fryman canyon so that he can bump into my A A ass and be like lizzy i heard you re vlogging can i make an appearance how s the pod do and i said she should have i bet he would have said yes i let him i so i was walking and talking with my friend and i like turned around and like did one of those like forgot everything i ve ever thought in my entire life up to this point and rob s like mid sentence and i was like so what about you amy and she s just like what dude and she like doesn t know who josh peck is so he just like passes us anonymously while she s like you re being weird and then i m like oh i m listening to you but i wasn t i was taking my phone out and i was like picture of josh peck only because i wanted to send it to you but yeah nothing for public nothing for public but we might put it on this pod no oh i don t think we can do that that s not nice he looks great yeah but i i just i have nothing like i like josh but i want to know like what makes your panties go wild for josh i wouldn t say my panties were going wild i mean every time you see him while you re hiking it s like a professional kingdom it s like a professional tingle you know what i mean it s like oh like he s someone that should be on this podcast oh yeah i love that for us i say that all the time yeah i know you acted oh i did consider like balling up and like rolling down the hill and then bumping into him being like oh my god i m so sorry but this is so random i have a podcast with ryland adams and a vlog you want to be on it i did consider the vlog thing but then i thought that s crazy but when are we not well um i think i don t know i probably haven t put out the video of what s going on but i m sure that we ve all we ve shared a photo by now of what s going on are you gon na let the dog out of the bag the puppy out of the bag do you want to talk about how this is another atrocious slap in my face what do you mean he flies me out for tuesday and wednesday and a puppy comes on thursday yeah these A A got a puppy that they don t want me to know they were like well liz is gon na have to leave on wednesday so she can t negatively imprint on our baby girl and how is potty training going in your household because that s A A everywhere most nervous about i ve done it twice and both were challenging because it s an added layer of i i like to be strict up front and let them earn their space because uh if you don t i feel like there s right yeah but with dogs i ve uh like previously we had gotten dog trainers and they their suggestions were you cr you let them out a lot yeah you crate train and as soon as they re out of their crate you take them to the bathroom and stuff and i just think if you don t potty train your dogs when you get them it s hard to go back and reverse that like if they think the house is on is like a toilet yes i totally get that and at the same time i read somewhere that my dog has no control over his bladder until he s nine months old french bulldogs yeah but he is really good about going on or near the piddle pads unless he s shooting in our bed which is just like very far from a piddle pad because i m ready that s just i think he s trying to tell us something Laughter so sometimes he shits in our bed like amber hurt i m ready for more love in my life i can t wait i m so excited are you brainstorming names for her this beauty retriever baby girl yeah it s a golden retriever you already have the name gorgeous what s her name i know it seems like a spur of the moment thing and it was in the moment but it s something we ve been discussing for a year is getting another dog yeah um and the evolution of how it happened for when it happened will be on the vlog because we filmed in real time of it happening and i just think it s a cute story so i ll save it for the vlog but i ll tell you guys here we have two we have two names picked out but we re not going to choose until we meet her because it it doesn t feel like you can name the i can t tell you no lizzy i mean i ll tell you off the podcast no you will you always say that one more thing and then the second that camera cuts neither of us remembers because we both have tiny brains well and we re not friends well i m just saying that s why jared s sleeping in the A A bed isn t it we go to separate rooms as soon as we we re done filming and we re like okay lies i lay on the dog bed by your desk and watch tick tocks like a loyal A A while you edit our futures i support like a good girl so i m so very excited i can not wait uh i m sorry that you re gon na miss it but i still need to meet my god baby icky which is the name you have stuck with now right yeah but now we re going back and thinking like is it jimmy oh do we want to call him jim just when icky had started to grow on me i know and it feels like it s become his name because i bought a name tag that s a little hamburger and says icky homo okay jimmy for icky i like icky now i know it s your dog you re living with icky we knew another french bulldog named jimmy that looks exactly like him so we want to like call him jimmy and james like short for james s gym and james is his other father it s a complicated love story my problem with the name that we want to so we have a name for the puppy and then we were looking at the picture of the puppy and we thought ah i don t know she s more of a claire yes and then well not clear but we thought she was more of the other one but then we were looking at the pictures and we thought she really is the name that we wanted to name our daughter our first daughter i don t know like what sex will be when we have a baby no that name is s uh but we have we have a name that we want for our first daughter whenever we have a daughter and so now it s like this conundrum do we name the dog what we wanted to name the daughter will there be a new name for the daughter or that s kind of how we came up with icky because joe you re going to name your daughter icky no our son cause joe was like joe wants boys i feel like i m going to be blessed with boys because i want girls so bad i just feel like god s like here you go A A and so one day i was joking with joe but joe s like what do you want to name our sons i was like i don t A A care you pick doesn t matter like he s like i like icarus and i was like have you do you know what that story is cause i don t well he didn t either so apparently a lot of people don t A A know i m not gon na go back down that hole with you i wish that i could because you said everybody knows that everybody knows everybody but the two closest men in your life well three uh i would say i m third joe james than me no i think it goes like bubs icky joe james you so you re five what is that what s happening the toilet oh scared me when you looked up like that i was like is it is it the end of days you know what really just drove me through the wall this morning what were we talking about before you no we were talking about dogma oh but joe wanted to name our son icarus okay go on um so i m expecting furniture but when are you not A A expecting that s beside the point what uh okay so this like groundhog s day and then i had to use my nasty voice and i said did you even really help me could you listen to my story my name is ryan and i was expecting this piece of furniture for an event i m throwing on the internet and let me tell you it has been backordered i don t answer unknown numbers right but because i was expecting a call and it was an number i thought ooh this could be it yeah so i answer it and it s somebody trying to sell me a promotion and i get it s her job and i i put my hands down for this or hanza i whatever i m not sure you get it um my heart goes out to this woman because she s just trying to do her job she had to deal with every cell she gets is a sale closer to richness i don t know yeah probably a pay bump and uh it was spectrum and she s like hi it s spectrum and i was like i just got to work i got ta go and she goes this won t take long and bulldoze is into the thing yeah he s like you just got ta hang up really i don t wan na be so rude right now but i am gon na hang up and she s like she keeps talking and telling me about the promotion yeah well the promotion and said i am gon na hang up but i don t want this to be perceived as rude i keep getting calls from spectrum and i m just like i don t make any of the calls in my house i can not decide whether or not you spectrum click and then they call back and i was like you know what i need you to take me off this list right the A A now and the guy was like all right i m gon na take you off the list but i need to let you know through these five different paragraphs that you are going to be called every day for the next days but on that th day no one s going to ever call you again and i was like let s start the days now tyler we re done that s on me for answering a potential spam call but i also was just thinking someone called me someone facetimed me from an unknown number the other day and like loki i kind of wanted to have chris facetime them back oh okay uh the problem is also do they think that we were just waiting around for sarah from spectrum to call me to get cable it s like they don t think i ever had cable figured out i m not sure what s going on with spectrum but they need to start mining their own goddamn business so the other thing i ve been doing in colorado is talking politely to spectrum uh is really caring for my yard like i never did that in california that s not true you have a rose garden and you have your lemons you re the lemon queen yeah but those were just existing and they re low maintenance and they come back right uh but here i really wanted to plant out some beautiful flowers so i spent the whole day with my mom planting like flowers yeah okay i can t wait to see it uh so it s very fun and i was very excited you still haven t acknowledged my flowers but i haven t seen that man and i ve been very concerned about my grass and like shane rolls his eyes with me because it s been a very dry hot summer and you can t over water like we have a well so we re not on the restrictions that like a lot of people are but i still like try to be conservative with water because i know that it s a scandal to have a grasp the drama it is and so uh i m just praying for the rain every night and i m like out there petting you just peeing on it will this help will this help come on stupid so yeah that s all i ve been doing here is like gardening taking care of my lawn at like p m i go out for a good two hours and just say nice things to it and hope it grows i d love that for you yeah he s a gardener boy i m a gardener a farmer boy um wait what s that game you guys play that s not real and doesn t amount to anything this seems like an attack no it s not that game that s like not about anything but you just play it and it s

about your ac unit mix up or your new nespresso machine i don t remember where you were talking about this specifically but you were talking about how you were on grindr oh i think it was shane s podcast you were talking about how you were on grindr and you went to a guy s house one time and he forgot to cancel on you and his other date showed up yeah joe did that with an ac unit repairman the other day because our ac unit went out and joe threw a A A fit and it s like i love my husband so much but that guy and his air conditioning is it s too much i m literally in my room like putting together some A A and it s like important and i hear joe run down the hallway and in my heart like my heart sank i was like something really bad s happened like his mom might not like something s A A like i ve never heard the man move like that in my entire life sorry i m laughing no it s have a feeling it was so scary and i like opened my door i m like baby oh my god what s wrong and he s like the air conditioning just broke and went off and i m just like are you A A kidding me because not this is also if our ac goes out it doesn t matter joe has installed swamp coolers in every A A bedroom there s a huge A A air conditioning unit that he bought at costco and put in the living room that s hideous there s a hideous A A air conditioning that he s installed in every A A room we don t need the central air it s crazy and it s so cold it actually pisses me off i ll enter a room and instantly be a little bit A A i ll up like it s it s painful how cold a room is and this A A is throwing that big of a tantrum over the ac going out regardless he calls him a million different repairmen to see who can come out the fastest i did the same thing this week he didn t cancel any of them they all show up in the front A A yard he has to go out there they re all measuring dicks yeah like one of them one of them is like whatever man you got here first but like our landlord will only pay for a specific person to fix our thing so like the guy who was like what do you mean you got here first was the one our landlord was paying for it so joe was like no i need you you though can go it s just like this awkward A A thing and they re like gas is a million dollars yeah just like i m sorry man they re all making a million dollars because all the ac units are going out it s summer and i feel like so we had the same thing happen where we had we installed central ac but then in the kitchen there s still split units and there s one in the bedroom and the split unit has been going and i think because we ve been running it so much some of the pipes have been freezing so it s trying to clear but there s a frozen pipe so i just need to turn it off and chill for a moment yeah that s what i ve learned in hindsight so i call the ac people the only one that s like yeah we ll work on this and we can get there today uh comes they obviously have no idea what they re doing and i m like these are the two units that are broken i come outside and they re working on the brand new central ac unit that i just had installed and i m like so flabbergasted and i said i literally just told you that these two were the units that s what you said those are the words you chose i literally just told you it was these anyways then the central air broke and the split units were broke i had a full blown meltdown because i didn t trust them to come back and fix it but i had to pay their two hundred dollar service fee to come out and break your existing unit yes so much love i love it and so he s giving me cuteness aggression though i have to say like i m literally gon na break my teeth out of my head and throw them at chris but i ve decided the problem with warranty companies with repair companies like i m calling an expert because i don t know yeah so even if i m supervising them i still don t know so what if they re pulling something out to make it worse to charge me more and i have no idea god no i i know i a lot of people are like what do you think about this is like dude i don t think A A anything about it if i had a single thought about this i would not be asking you oh my gosh i love you uno can you tell i m sad you are the sweetest boy in the whole world he s got lipstick on his dog sister coming too you have a sister on the way okay before we get into the meat of today s show i thought we could talk about awkward moments that we can t shake yeah did any stand out to you i would love to know yours first well i want to know how awkward we re going because i m not trying to like bare my soul and then have you be like one time i walked out and i was wearing a pants and they were floods something i didn t realize that wasn t embarrassing is like in colorado it gets below freezing in the winter obviously and i once stuck my tongue to the flagpole and it froze there yeah see this is what i m saying that s not an awkward thing that you can t shake and that s also probably not your story you saw that in a christmas story that plays out no i want pictures i want proof you think i took a picture this was before cell phones yeah likely story for a phantom A A awkward moment what made you want to share that story well you know how well what something that was really mortifying somebody i work with yeah i got on a zoom call and i follow up with them on instagram yeah and they re always posting pictures of their baby and in the moment i had a brain fart of if the baby was a boy or a girl and so i brought up the baby and i was like oh how s the baby doing she he and i couldn t remember the gender of the baby and like i and then the mom had to tell me the gender of the baby which makes me look so disengaged and i just it was i know it doesn t sound mortifying but you should have been on the gender of that baby i still fall asleep thinking about like how awful that moment was yeah and the way in which i recovered was like it non existent yeah so i just stuck my foot in my mouth and then shane heard it too because it was on speakerphone and he was walking past and then he was dying and he was like yeah no no that was really embarrassing oh no that s funny i was offered a job one time and i didn t know how much to charge for it so i thought i was emailing a friend of mine like how much hey like i ve never done this before like it was a task i d never done before i was like i ve never done this job before so i don t really know what to quote this person to pay me but i wanted to be a lot of money and i accidentally sent it to the person who was offering me the job and then i was like what do i do and i tried to like make it right by being like sorry that was for my manager and did you end up working with said person i did but they didn t pay me oh yeah they never paid my invoice they did agree to the rate though whatever chris do you have any that stick out i know you re not prepared so if you don t see on the

m always farting to be completely honest with everyone i m never not farting yeah it s awful and it s embarrassing talk about awkward moments my entire existence has been nothing but an unwanted fart leak oh my god this was joe and i were fighting and we were at that airbnb in temecula that we stayed in during the at the beginning of the lockdown and i thought he had left we were because we were having a big argument because i was just being a nasty A A for no reason because i was upset that i was turning and everyone forgot oh except for him who would play into this like beautiful thing and i was just crying and i was like i want to cry if i want to A A cry i m going to A A cry i moved back it was not enough i felt like enough so anyways we re fighting i swear to god he walks away and i

soul left my body and i was like i just want you to know i wouldn t have farted like that if you were right there and now i want to die more somebody had said uh never mind i thought i thought i had seen something Laughter our sponsors call and want their money back who s the last person you searched on instagram oh how do we find out you just go to search and then when you click the search button it will tell you oh my sister in law yeah and then khloe kardashian wait really yeah she was looking at stacy to find one of her recipes i actually don t think i ve ever searched any of these people i maybe have searched jenny you have for sure because they wouldn t just be there but i don t even know who this is let me see who i ve searched all mine were like uh i was trying to find that crumble exposed but then my last one was durie from the real housewives it s all real housewives women and then i did i guess wendy williams has created an account for her podcast so i followed that and so it was dirty wendy williams podcast and kyle richards cute we love kyle richards do you know who that is um oh my gosh i know she s in the halloween movies and i know that she s a real housewife and i know she s friends with kris jenner and i know that she made skinny girl margaritas that was bethenny frankel are they different people okay yep okay um let s see another dare if we can get a juicy dare before we move on a juicy dare i guess we should have pre selected right i mean yeah but look at us look at us now do you want to try and make ourselves cry could take too long or it could be really fast i i well yeah i mean i don t know if i can can you do it sometimes if i like really think about the fact that you re letting jared sleep in the bed and not me i m trying to push the tongue against my uh roof of my mouth really hard i ve heard some actresses do that i don t think that works i got a little teary yeah i thought you i thought you were there oh my gosh yeah you re about to let one out i ve if i hadn t been distracted sorry i could have really gotten into it i was just trying to share tips sometimes if i think about that pink song you took my hand and showed me how he promised me you d be around okay i thought this was funny i d give anything um we do have uh some some pretty juicy advice though i mean we re definitely out of A A we don t even need a segway everybody can tell that we crashed and burned minutes ago moving on let s get into some advice though okay so this first one is a voicemail from a loyal i don t know if she s a loyal viewer she A A better be okay let s get into it her first thing is i m not that loyal to you guys but i do wonder what you think about this hi guys i need some advice my boyfriend and i have been together for a year and a half and we have a three month old daughter lately he s been acting weird so i asked him if he was cheating he told me he s looking at girls at work two in particular that worked with him almost every day it broke my heart and i really don t know what to do from here i m glad that he was honest and he promised he would stop but i just need some advice i would appreciate it i honestly feel like uh A A you man i have a three month old child and if you can t commit to a relationship with the mother of your children and your children then you need to get the A A out of it and do not waste her A A time my advice is more to him and it s pull your head out of your A A ass and be grateful for the beautiful situation before you are you out of your goddamn A A mind so much how dare you so much how dare you i mean i know a lot of and i m not justifying his behavior in any regard but i m saying i know like pregnancy or having babies uh can change a lot i know it s not uncommon to for the woman to get postpartum depression or for the guy to feel detached and maybe in his detachment he feels uh disconnection from the family in general but yeah google i feel detached because my wife just had a baby instead of looking into oh no women in your A A office space i agree yeah i think uh even though he was honest with you i think uh you guys need to have a serious discussion and talk about how you re going to get through this if you re going to choose to get through this together i would immediately require and request that my boyfriend go to couples therapy with me because if you are gon na work it out i think there s gon na need to be somebody else weighing in on the situation that has a professional take because i i too would wan na make something work with my baby s daddy but it s hard to fathom that a person would act this way or even say that to you in this very fragile time in your life congratulations on the baby dude that s exciting nonetheless and i yeah i agree with what you said like you have to go to therapy with me it s a bummer it s like it s a bummer because i also get understatement yeah and i get not i get needing and wanting to work on it and to try and i think that s very admirable i m also going to say that if you guys do decide to work on it and try it it ll probably be very hard but for your own mental piece finding forgiveness for him for his dirtbag A A behavior and uh because it s not really for him it s for you you need that peace of mind and truly working for yourself to overcome it if you guys do decide to stay together because again that ll be for you and i on i i like thinking back on it i honestly hate the honesty you know it s oh i hate the honey you were just pregnant you carried his child yeah nothing justifies this form of honesty because it s like i m not cheating on you he can take a moment of private reflection and say you know what maybe i should look into what s going on with me and work on it before i start considering cheating on the mother of my A A child and i think even before therapy asking the root of the issue are we not having sex enough what like what what is the factor in which you felt the need to look at another person in that type of way i mean it also sounds like you guys got pregnant pretty early in your relationship because they ve been together for a year and the baby s three months old so there s also a chance that i i agree with what you said ryland you should definitely reevaluate the relationship is this the right relationship for you is it the right relationship for him because it takes two to tango um and if it s not what does co parenting look like and again wish he could have had a tiny bit of patience and waited a little bit longer than three months postpartum but i guess you know life on life s terms and sometimes it s rocky and it s hard to accept but you have to because there s no other option yeah wishing you the best and your baby of course yeah sending you lots of strength spend a lot of time reflecting on what specifically you need because you re a new mom you got to be mom comes first right now whatever is healthy and right for you mentally and physically takes priority so focus on that hopefully you have some family you can lean on as well yeah okay this next one is an engagement update if you remember we had a caller call in the girl who really wanted to be engaged and she was young and your advice was chill the A A out and i said your val your feelings are valid she s been married for years now so she said hi ryland and lizzie hope everyone is keeping well thought i would send you an update we haven t gone to paris yet which is where she was hoping to get engaged and we re not going for a few weeks but i took yours and the audience s advice and sat down and spoke to my boyfriend about how i felt about the whole situation i know deep down jay is the guy i want to spend the rest of my life with but him supposedly not matching my energy had me second guessing whether or not he genuinely felt the same i joked that i can wait until the next leap year and propose to him then and he got upset with me his response was that he does want to propose and wants to get married but only in the next few years so he wants to wait i soon got a little emotional myself and explained him not wanting to talk about it more made me feel invalid and that he would never propose i really should have chilled my bill i told him that the reason i m so pushed to get engaged now because i loved him so much and i wanted to take this massive massive step with him he finally confessed that he was not in the right mindset to get engaged but reminded me how much he loved me and said he will propose he wants to catch me off guard at a time i wouldn t expect it with paris obviously not being that moment i ve had a lot to think about and decided i should take lizzy s advice chill your bill thank you guys so much for your opinions and to everyone who told me i wasn t crazy for wanting this so badly at least i know i found my soul mate she said she ll be sure to send pics of paris when they get back whether or not you see this email well she said merci beaucoup also dude great update um because i like tru i don t know if i ve shared on the podcast before but i literally ruined my first proposal opportunity with joe and i wanted to marry him two weeks in i was psychotically at my bloomingdale s day job looking at dresses being like i m gon na buy this one on store credit because i m gon na get married in it this weekend at the beach with the boy i just started dating two weeks ago because i A A know he s the one and i was right he was the one but he was like i m not gon na A A marry you two weeks and that s insane and then when it started coming down to it i just kept being like when is it gon na happen like i m i m going to leave you i m going to leave you because i don t think that we re on the same page and if you don t love me like i love you and you re too chicken A A to commit to this then i m gon na walk and like i was like spending the night at your house sometimes too just like making the threat real i was like i m gon na go stay with ryland which i is valid like to feel that way to feel so head over heels for someone and them not reciprocating that energy is valid but i agree with you like but the problem the problem was i was jumping to the conclusion that he was not reciprocating the energy right and i was not asking him what he wanted and then one day when we were like in the throes of an argument about this because i couldn t show my bill he said well you ve never asked me what i want and i said well what do you want like i didn t mean it because i m an A A and the poor guy spilled the entire beans about the proposal plan he s like well i was gon na do it at this restaurant in scottsdale when we go for this i planned this whole trip blah blah blah blah hat the ring i was like i was like i just met you i wouldn t stop complaining no and i was like baby i didn t mean like how do you want to propose i meant like when do you see and have like what are your life goals you know what i mean like what do you want in this life well he just like seized up and i was like i m so sorry i exist and then when the actual proposal came around i knew so i wasn t surprised and i was all i was a A A again but it was still a beautiful moment and he found a way to surprise me even though i m the worst woman in the whole world to ever try if you re confident in your relationship and you believe what this man is telling you that he does feel the same way yeah let it breathe for a second to let him plan something beautiful for the two of you so that you can experience it unlike our beautiful elizabeth yeah get out of your own way girl exp like just take it as he wants to give it to you because i bet it s going to be sick oh i just remembered there was a ps and i didn t see it because it was on the other page uh oh okay so uh she said p s he must have told his mom about the whole thing because she told me in person after a couple of drinks not long after the podcast came out that she knows her son and i are meant to be and that she has never met someone so perfectly matched for her son girl i m excited for you it sounds like you have a beautiful love and no matter what when or where this proposal happens every day leading up to it and every day after you re gon na have each other so just relax into life and enjoy it sorry i told you to chill your bill that s fighting words in my house dude crazy like any if if any words should be banned for being triggering and upsetting it s the words relax or chill A A off with that A A are you trying to have me burn your house down i love that she s mad at herself honestly well thank you so much for listening and watching to our podcast and supporting all of us this episode was a fever dream dude i feel like we haven t even started yet make sure you follow lizzie on youtube she s vlogging maybe chris will start vlogging too who knows who knows um obviously listen to shane s podcast and we love you so much we ll see you next week goodbye and that s it Music you
Music thank you Music you ve just got here and I m ready for you to go I m ready to leave what is wrong with you I called my husband and he s gon na come get me no you Laughter why are you doing this I don t know I think I m just fussy she sat down and she goes I can t wait for this to be over and I was like then let s cancel the podcast if you re not having fun doing it anymore then I m not gon na do it either because do you want to be honest with each other no I said this I said this morning I just a little stressed out and I m like oh once everything s recorded I m gon na be like oh so you can t wait till it s even over either that s bad oh no I don t think it s bad I enjoyed doing it with you well then why can t we wait till it s over well I ve got a few things I m living for it s a big Fu to everyone watching oh that we re trying to rush through this I m not trying to rush through anything it seems like you are okay TBH I was being low key aggressive experts would say I m a little fussy I ve had a long A A day I went to light our background and I said ooh smell my candle and what did you say I said it smells yummy but it also smells like the carcinogens that are gon na give my babies birth the facts and is this a you thing or a Joe thing Joe doesn t like me being around candles that are whatever parabens or something and can you explain though I need to know like what I m what are you doing it s I guess some people feel that there are certain chemicals in scented candles that can cause cancer oh yeah so Joe doesn t like us to burn scented candles should we blow it out also delicious well you can get like certain candles that don t have those things in them and can I m gon na need you to like tell me something I know I don t know though I rely on Joe heavily for to survive on this life Joe just buys me specific candles that I m allowed to burn you do it by smell you think no it s not by smell that smells like it s a bad one I mean just judging by it I doubt it s like a soy candle or whatever or like a beeswax Candlelight but there s a paraben I don t even know if they re called I don t even know a problematic to use bees things too and not in the same sense that it causes cancer okay just kills the bees does it kill the Beast I don t know I don t think I don t think it kills the bees because it s like you need the bees to be alive to function right do bees die when we get their wax though because like alpacas I used to have this thing I know where do you think wax comes from I guess the hive right but I ve seen like even honey so then why is honey a problem if like vegans do not like honey because well it s because it comes from an animal isn t it a bee yeah and so it s all living things but if it s veganism also confuses me because it s like aren t plants living too well like where is the line like I know there s unethical fur but there s also I think we re literally off to the dumbest start like honestly but I just want to say like I have a fake alpaca over there but now owning alpacas I know it s no are you offended by your fake alpaca because this is what I m saying I know there was no harm done to the alpaca to get the fur rather it s necessary the alpacas rely on being sheared before they will die because they ll get too hot in the Blazing summer heat yeah I don t think bees die when you get their honey or their wax but I know that like honey is a problem is what I ve heard I haven t looked into it who said that honey is the problem I ve seen some things on Instagram I see the headlines it sounds just so A A I see the headlines and then I keep scrolling because I I guess I m a monster I didn t care enough to look into it I ve never seen the headline I don t even know what you re talking about like there be there is a shortage of bees in the world honey is delicious though I had it I had a peanut butter and honey sandwich today before you guys arrive because you guys were in the air and I wanted to order food but I didn t want to assume what you guys wanted to eat for lunch yeah so I was like I need a little something to hold me over and I looked in my pantry there s nothing like always yeah so I made myself a little peanut butter and honey so good and then the second you land Lizzie s like I go okay well you did some stupid girl thing and booked a flight that doesn t work with our schedule well no because we re doing a different schedule today because I m staying the night oh yeah I wonder what s gon na happen I I know it s very tightly scheduled I could tell you exactly down to the minute Mark what s gon na happen baby and I think that s the thing is it s not just that we re like normally we do the podcast you do too and you go yeah but you want to do a vlog segment she s turned it into her business venture and then your guys is welcome we got ta make a new intro yeah and so it s just there s a lot to do and we re both trying to be vloggy girls so yeah there s a lot to be done what are you vlogging everything oh I did a whole vlogmas yesterday because I had to get it in before you guys came what did you what did you do or is it a secret because I also did a whole vlogmas yesterday I baked something oh she baked it s delectable I like it and it was beautiful it s like an Instagram yeah I ll save I ll save the review anyway I asked these two what they want from Jersey Mike Jersey Mike s yeah I m you re not gon na come out of this as a good person no you re a shockingly out of touch person it should be illegal to order these two things no no no what do you guys want so thoughtful so caring so nice so sweet no what do you guys want from Jersey Mike yeah he said we re I m getting Jersey Mike s what are you who are you guys and then on your A A phone we

put it on when we re recording the podcast doesn t work for Joe oh yeah he s my priorities did you realize for the first time ever honestly I was trying to figure out how you even pull that maneuver because my brother was like oh if you put like sleeping or something it won t do it and then I put it on and I didn t get that message I get that I get every time I message you that like oh I set mine as like a little A A you how do you do that I say sorry tell Rylan A A you no literally tell me I don t know I don t know how do you make a rude response come to me every time I message you it s like Lizzy s too busy to talk and some say that but it s true the other day I really needed her attention for something work related and she wasn t answering and so then I saw the iPhone gave me a thing like can not notify Lizzy notify anyways question mark all the time boom and it and then I got a response from you Chris all the time too he s gon na do that psycho A A too yeah he s a cameraman he can t have his A A phone going off at work oh though where I did turn on the do not disturb yeah oh yeah I turned that on all the time yeah I hate you guys just put your phone on silent it s so rude when I text Dad you do not talk right now I m like really quickly I feel like Chris has an answer on the bees I would like to Circle back I do have an answer okay way to speak up for yourself I mean I could hear him going and then it s just like we just went crazy so I wanted to bring it back to him for those that think Lizzy s mean to Chris look at this circling back to information she wants for her well okay first off there are conflicting things but as they re out usually are but the first thing that popped up said beekeepers are not hurting bees intentionally when they are harvesting honey almost everyone is doing it the same way that they leave enough honey because I guess if you don t leave enough honey they can starve or they can be bad or harmful for the bees but beekeepers tend or try to make sure there s enough honey for the bees and the hive consider it um so what s the most problematic end of this I mean the other end was saying that bees aren t treated well uh much like any other Factory farmed animal because they re enclosed so that the beekeepers can collect the honey and they re making them produce more honey than they would naturally so they re not free range basically uh I don t know I guess they re just treated badly and and I try to get the free range eggs and so they re not consensually employed and some some of them are are starving they re not they re not left is like a huge World issue and we re like no it is a huge World issue why is honey problematic Laughter exactly my point I didn t say it I don t think we even know what we re fighting about I m having a great time okay back to Jersey Mike s oh my God hit me with it idiot whoa that s a huge name Chris and I both text him we want our sandwiches can you finish whoa they say they want Mike s way he goes what the A A is that well I know they ask you when you go to the store I ve been once what why is this so funny I don t get it foreign like everyone knows this no but I said no listen this is where I think you re I have to read the text messages because they re so funny okay but in my defense I said listen it hurts I said on doordash which sponsors our show thank you so much there isn t an option for like yes yeah Mike s way isn t an option isn t an option on Postmates what does that even mean I said wow that s insane just forget the mic swear I guess Chris sent what Mike s way is like you need to explain so Chris sends what it means both of you want everything in that nice video that s why we asked for it well the thing is okay so it doesn t what I ve discovered after Chris sent me the description of what is in Mike s way because I was like what s in Mike s way unless he s like I don t know like no I said like oils and seasoning it s like it s Mike s way like it s everything that you get in a Jersey Mike s Subway it s Mike s way it s Jersey Mike s way it s the way that he likes this game he s like well I have these options so you need to tell me what it is and Chris so thoughtfully set me up as Mike s way and I did discover on the app once you click on a sandwich they automatically check off what is mine how was I supposed to know that that was my Square oh my gosh it s so funny it was such a nightmare and there s nothing worse than like I was trying to like set up everything for the podcast get everything ready to go Lizzy s asking me what ingredients I have in my kitchen and I m trying to order food and there s all these options for three sandwiches and I m like if you guys just don t tell me what you want on your A A sandwiches No One s Gon na Eat It was just wild when you were like what s Mike s way you are ordering lunch next time I ll pay for it do I just have mascara running down oh God that would be good sweet sweet revenge let s talk about you flying with A A all over yourself the next text I said was I m seriously dying of laughter from my Center seat on this full ass Southwest flight with just a little bit of A A on my knee so we ve re we renamed our puppy shitty ass oh cause he s got a shitty ass and I got to the airport today and realized there was just a little bit of A A on my knee oh it s because those pugs have those exposed A A yeah it s because his asshole s exposed so when he sits on your lap if there s something left over it s just well I don t know how it got on my knee but there was just a little bit I should probably sat on you while you were sitting on the couch no because I like left I don t know it doesn t make sense he was also A A all over the house while I left so I had to pick up a bunch of A A also any normal person would go to the bathroom and dab it with water get it off and I don t think they have paper towels at the Burbank Airport they just have those blowy things I d rather walk around with it a little wet on your it doesn t look like it was just a little bit of A A did you see that Viral Tick Tock going around that was like somebody hit the streets I didn t watch it because I thought I ll bring this to the podcast because I m curious and this is good for Chris to ask too but the question is like you know how all those things are going viral like how do you what do you do to afford this car what do you make oh yeah so this person on the street was like can girls pee with tampons in and I was like go away I don t want to see what their responses because I don t I genuinely what do you think what do you think I mean they use all of your mind use all of it turn it all on right now Chris what do you think I actually don t know what do you think I think this feels like can you A A with a dick in your butt no a little bit maybe a little bit no I can t maybe a little bit I don t know no I read I hope they serve beer in hell and I know for a fact you can A A with a dick in your butt if the Dick s coming out of your butthole I guess the A A could come with the dick but not with this A A couldn t come out with sorry if you re eating but oh I don t know I also just the answer is yes you can pee with a tampon in so are they different holes I ve been told they are so you don t even really know I m unclear on the whole I m on the way you just spill the game like a mom Chris can you pull that up apparently there s two or three holes I know but the p is different than yeah he comes out of the area uh yes it s absolutely possible to pee with a tampon in I knew that I told you yeah all the time as a woman as a woman when you pull your tampon out is there pee on it if you ve peed like is it I think it depends if you get it on the string well no I m talking about the the actual tampon you would know to tell if it was wet like if it absorbs because it absorbs the period so it must be a different hole it s absolutely a different hole Your Case Closed your urine comes out of your urethra and your menstrual blood comes from the vagina so it s a different hole so the vagina itself is literally a hole you re plugging that I don t know how would you Google is the vagina so how would guys not mistake your pee hole for your vagina hole because it s very different you don t even know I know that one is like a time you have a urethra vaginas are very confusing have you ever tried to stick something in your urethra if I did I wouldn t be able to pee out of it but have you like it s a tiny hole that s the thing though have you heard of sounding no where there s like a little metal rod that guys shove in their penises that makes me sick and I don t even have a dick I want a barf like honestly that s making me sick I literally might barf you re gon na have to stop it s a thing like it s like why isn t that in saw you know what I mean if you want to live if you want to truly appreciate the life you have you will take this metal rod and shove it into your pee hole uh so there are two openings in the Volvo the vaginal opening and the opening to the urethra that s what it says so the vulva is the stuff around the vagina which is the whole the urethral opening is the tiny hole that you pee out of located just below your clitoris the vaginal opening is right below your your wrist and it s all encased in the vulva so I guess my question though is how could we just figured out A A the dick years guys no but I am curious like how does the tampon not mistakenly go up the pee hole there s a difference in hole size okay so when you re pushing something up it just goes if you think about it yeah a penis goes in a vagina it doesn t go into urethra you and I both have your urethras and we both got sick at the thought of shoving a metal rod in one okay so that means it s a tiny hole so if you were to really inspect you could find where you okay I mean Case Closed if you pee and your tampon doesn t have pee on it right okay it s all Case Closed there s multiple holes we re not sure you barely knew I know now I cracked the case A A solved okay do you want to talk about the best day of your life or what oh my god do I want to talk about the best day of my life I ve been dying to see you to talk about this I mean you called me right I know but you didn t care I mean I cared more than the other person you were talking to that s not true they cared more than you really yes they know it s a big deal for me so multiple times in my life I have been out in the wilderness the Wilds of Los Angeles specifically Burbank and Sherman Oaks a valley girl if you will and one time I was smoking a cigarette and a gutter and a Tesla drove by and it had judges see his face all over and I went that was JoJo siwa mute him mute him he s in the middle of my story mute him at least it wasn t a yawn it s about to be look at him no it was adjusting so then I m on the phone with my baby mama Haley and her mom s there and I m on speakerphone and there s a A A Lamborghini in front of me a white Lamborghini with two Toy Story characters at the back of it and I go but that s Jojo siwa and then I went I bet that s Jojo siwa and it was A A Jojo siwa I looked in the mirrors and then I was like should I follow but she was faster than me because I m in a Prius and she was in a Lamborghini you couldn t speed up and at least wait not the way a Lamborghini does with a Prius was she going that fast yeah around a yellow light that A A is reckless low key like really though and she literally called me and was I thought she could have floated into a different app it was sick I love JoJo the fact that I keep being around Jojo siwa and Josh Peck means that they must come onto the show I mean that would be great but what are the odds what are the odds what are the odds honestly maybe not big I don t think they re that big of them coming on I don t understand what we re talking about because statistics aren t really my thing so the second we started getting too deep in the odds I was very confused I m gon na be real with you so I don t really know what the odds are but it feels like they re Slim have I just reached out to them slim is not good that means that they won t come on oh sad how smart you are I m not asking a question I m a creative type I can t be good at everything I can t sing I don t bowl and I don t do statistics everything else I m great at and what would you say to Jojo had you been at the same stoplight what have you been nothing I would have been scared no I I get instantly terrified if it s someone I love I m I like shut down I m like you did send me that Tick Tock of that Meghan Trainor song that she s got a Gucci um and I was like wow the amount of effort JoJo put into that Tick Tock where she s like twenty five thousand dollars worth of effort huh yeah yeah because she had all the designer clothes on that s that woman she s about A A figured it out and she s like I would love to have JoJo on this on the show got it figured out since she was like eight what s that like like I just discovered what vaginas are all about like it seems like you ve been known and I want to know how you knew okay she s also got a cruise that I m like do I go on it or like she s going to be the Grand Marshal of her Cruise no like xomg pop is the Grand Marshal of the cruise and it s like I want to go but I also feel like as an adult woman without a child it s kind of sketch for me to go and I m not trying to get it she s gon na make an appearance like was she a helicopter in and she has a helicopter I don t know why wouldn t she I mean she s everywhere with her face all over it A A I love her why did she Toy Story characters on her Lamborghini I think she s like sponsored by Disney she goes to Disney all the time her girlfriend Avery asked her to be her girlfriend at Disney this is getting too deep is it it s not that deep I yeah okay okay this holiday season the best deal in

honestly none of us live in Pasadena that was A A wild that was really crazy of you to have everyone A A fly drive out to A A Pasadena bowling for a night of bowling like A A you couldn t find something in the valley ends in Studio City honest to God no it can t what the A A was that anyways we drive out to Pasadena I m like whatever we re here great and I m minding my own business sucking ass at bowling having a great A A time do you go bowl with the curbs up I asked for them and they all laughed at me and said that they usually only do that for children and I said okay and can I please have them and they wouldn t give them to me but I do have a method where it s like if I jump a little bit and I throw it from between my legs with both hands like this oh it s um it goes good like I m not good and it hurts my whole body but it it s I m knocking A A down I got multiple strikes yes I swear to god wow it s embarrassing thank you the point of your story please I m minding my own business throwing the bowling ball from between my legs with both hands hopping on one foot getting strikes and looking over my shoulder I see not Laughter the love of my life oh the love of my life know him not personally but kind of I thought you ve had like awkward encounters no I have and they re called play dates so when I was a young warthog I had told all these stories well whatever I told Haley that night too will you you remind you refreshed him no I was looking at him I was like and I was being Lizzy so like around my like co workers I was like Haley Jo Osmond s here I know him I m probably not gon na say hi like because I m crazy and then my friend Maya was like oh I ll go tell him I was like Maya you re drunk don t do that and she stops him and I see her stopping him because it s one of those things where it s like he s walking and he s got a baseball cap on and you can tell he s trying to be like Incognito guy and I m I already have hives you know what I mean I d have a second he walked in because I m in love with him and he comes by and he s like brought his head down and Maya grabs him Haley Haley and he likes nothing worse nothing worse than that grabbing Hands On grabbing him and he goes she s like no my friend knows you Lizzy do you know her he s like I guess she maybe looks familiar and I m like I don t look familiar and then you have to start name dropping yeah I did remember years ago when I was at so and so s famous house was it years ago I don t know it was years ago I did say that he remembered the house well of course he would yeah hi Haley come on the Pod buddy missed opportunity tonight Joe was behind me and he s like I m just gon na let you have this moment and I like totally I was like just so you know like I was obsessed with you I had your picture all over my room I bought myself a fake engagement ring and I had your head shot framed by my bed so like that play date was a really A A big deal to me and he s like cool so like what are you doing here I was like I m at a wrap party he s like what s the show and I was like it s not really a show foreign you re like we re in Pasadena I was like we re in Pasadena Haley obviously this isn t a real A A show this is a shitty rap party obviously this isn t a studio gig I ve been looking up Haley do any of us look like we re doing well no wow that s being on Haley s behalf no why would it be mean he wasn t part of our party he was there with his friends in Pasadena I think he lives there no Pasadena s A A beautiful it is nice it s very nice and it s Rich it s it s yeah I don t know why anyone would go that way though I d rather go towards like the ocean in Calabasas yeah Pasadena is a lot cheaper oh it is yeah I didn t know that honey what are you doing Honey s so cute okay she looks thinner so do you want to talk about some more of your adventures in Los Angeles like what do you mean let s make a deal ugh I mean you can bring this up because we were on the phone when it happened if you want to well okay so well no you you got ta you got ta bring us in on the journey so when I called Ryland this is so sweet honey bunny so when I called Rylan to tell him about Jojo siwa I started checking my emails also because I was done with my story and he started talking and it s like what are we gon na talk about now so I started ignoring his intro his part of the conversation and reading my emails and I got a A A email from the casting director of uh let s make a deal let s make a deal it s sad that I know your story more than you do and because I don t know if you guys know this about me but I was on an episode of Let s Make a Deal because I was very poor send a link I don t know how to find it honey this has got ta stop honey you got ta pick a lab girl yeah is it mine come sit mama so like let I don t know if you guys know this but it is like one of the most demoralizing things to be a A A part of because they take you and put you in a like garage and like is it called Sun City what s that horrible part of Valley that s like not safe do you know what I m talking about I don t know if we should alienate more I don t know what it s called but there s a part of Los Angeles that s like not safe and like that s where they film this A A they take you they make you audition twice who s the host Wayne Brady okay they make you audition twice for this show once at a casting place in Burbank and then when you get to this like DMV garage or whatever you have to dress up as something stupid so you already feel like a A A A A do they pay you enough to audition twice they don t upay you at all what they don t pay you at all you go I was so broke that I had a friend to drive me to both auditions and then you d win yes how did you know you what are the odds of getting chosen very slim because the audience is what people and how many people play and I m there I don t like maybe seven or eight and I m there in a A A unicorn onesie by the grace of God I saw my friend Evan there I was like like I m not alone I haven t A A want a kitchen set he was doing we re both broke we were both doing broke people things trying to get money in Los Angeles you know you have to pay taxes on whatever you win he learned that the hard way so I was there he got to actually play I didn t get to A A play they locked you in that garage for A A six hours then they make you leave your phone somewhere and then they put you on a bus move you away from your phone to another stage where they sell you like like those very small Costco packs of chips and coffee for like dollars they charge you they charge you for the crafty this seems like a Ponzi scheme it s like sane they make you go to two castings yeah you show up and then they charge you for food it s like how are they really making their money us we re paying for all of it emotionally and financially and so I m sitting in the back row like they re like the more you dance and the more you look into it the more likely you re gon na get selected I m in my stupid A A unicorn you re so loud oh my God and I m like like dancing alone in my A A onesie they wouldn t let me me and Evan sit near each other either which was really sad so I m just like alone there and there s like groups of people who come with like friends from out of town and they re living their best lives but it s like for us La locals who are there because we re A A hungry it s sad it s A A sad and then at the end they come up to me and they go do you want to try and make and I was like that s why the A A I m here Wayne Brady and he s like if you can shoot this piece of mint gum that had tiny mint spores in it it s literally like a strip of mint Spore gum he s like if you can chew this and blow a bubble in seconds I ll give you bucks and I was like you know that is this for his own entertainment or is it felt like A A cruel and unusual okay because there s no A A way you can do that and they gave me mint Sports so they knew I couldn t succeed and no matter what I m gon na A A try my hardest so I was like a A A unicorn because I need that money I need that money Wayne I freaking needed that money Wayne and I didn t do it so I didn t get the money oh and then I just went home and then you have to get on a A A bus they take you back to the garage you have to wait in line to get your A A and then you have to go home so very demoralizing demoralizing and then they emailed me and asked if I wanted to come on the show again and here s the deal A A you I emailed her back I was like I m triggered by this email please take me off your mailing list did she reply no you re like I will not go through that torturous experience and also like A A you Wayne Brady well that reminded me I saw a clip uh going should we break down wow sorry we have one minute oh let s break down okay see okay goodbye so that reminded me of I saw a clip going around of Meghan markle s podcast I ve never actually listened to the podcast but I heard this clip where she was talking about her experience on a game show because she was one of the briefcase girls on I think it was Dill or No Deal I thought it was let s make a deal but then it s hard to say what the titles are honestly there yeah I don t know very confusing yeah I just know my house is Wayne Brady the clip from her podcast is crazy it s as though I don t know if her entire podcast is like this but an audiobook as though she s reading her own audiobook like her and other people sat in a room to script an hour of content for her to read as though it s her audiobook should we make Chris do that for our podcast can you imagine if we tried to read our podcast but it was so neither of us can read and then in that moment I knew but basically just talking about she felt demoralized even though she was paid as A A to go be a model I was tired because I have exceptional Beauty and then I was objectified for that beauty for the job that I applied for as a beautiful person and I just can t help but thinking am I nothing but too beautiful I left an icky stop filling in my stomach I spelled something like that because it s we say shitty ass now and so she can what oh and so she had to leave the show because it gave her a bad Vibe and I just you imagine being so rich that you can just leave a job because it gives you a bad word she felt demoralized which I guess is I get it girl hey Megan at least you were well lit probably had free craft service got dressed beautifully got to have your phone and got paid I m sure very handsome and I bet you weren t in the shitty part of the valley that s not safe I bet she was on a studio a lot I m pretty sure she was on what s it called Fairfax I bet she had a parking spot A A get the A A out of here I can t stand her I can t stand her I don t care honestly this is the one that this is it this is the one that ends the mall with her A A like just her Cadence and the way that she reads it it s like girl I might listen to her podcast if it was like made it to the top Echelon of performers a dream which a lot of people have and few ever get to realize and when I realized I had achieved that dream I thought ew well another one of the co hosts came out and was not co host of the briefcase girls came out and said it was a career starter for me I never felt objectified by the job I was treated wonderfully and I loved it so I guess it was through her perspective which isn t wrong like she s definitely allowed to feel that way yeah but it s just like I don t know her in general is just like it s a lot I have to hit my head against the wall a couple of times I mean I if if if we were to give Meghan Markle some advice though advice though that s how this segment started originated we were gon na just give celebrities advice unsolicited unsolicited advice so let s do that so Megan here s some advice though I think you need to wake up in the morning and make a A A gratitude list and start thanking God for every single thing you have in this big beautiful life including your A A compound in Montecito it s a lot A A it s a A A lot thank you God for these blessings you have bestowed up and your contracted by the family yeah and Spotify didn t even fire you here I m sick of it enough is enough do you think anyone s listening I m not trying to be mean I know she s highlighting good things well I was talking about Kim Kardashians as well she s always like promoting it like my new podcast I m like Kim has a podcast she talks about yeah I mean it s nice it s like she s doing good for the world she s talking about the reform work that she does is that what it s called perform I mean whatever where she helps people get out of prison yeah yeah great good stories no Kim s a badass and everyone s like like her but it s how about those pictures of her in court the illusion because there s no cameras in this court so the only like okay backstory yeah Black China sued all the sisters except for Courtney and Chris because she thought they cost them a job or cost her her reality show yeah but it s really like you lost the reality show on E about your relationship when you lost your relationship yeah what s the show if they re broken up exactly I guess their life s individually and it seemed like it was toxic as A A oh yeah more on that in a second I want to talk about toxic reality TV shows in like five seconds but the all the images that were released from court that they showed on the Kardashians the like the recent episode the girls look A A crazy and it feels like the whoever was in court doing those sketches was like A A these girls like they re gon na look like A A in this record and the reason I brought it up is because in the picture that I saw Kim is like looking like her lawyer self she like has her pin to her notepad and she s like um Kim s like I have to go now guys because I m gon na go for closing statements like what a unique opportunity I have just go sit in on a court hearing where I m being sued for a hundred million dollars crazy my life is crazy for such a big elaborate show don t you feel like nothing actually ever happened no I always think about that too I m like wow they must be so busy but it s like a lot of wheel spinning and like not all you know what I mean that s my problem is there s so many like high highs like and even when Kim s excited like she gets a huge Balenciaga campaign she s like pinch me I can t even believe what s happening it s like I feel nothing because I heard her wanting that Ripley s dress I told my mom like I will marry you and it s like Kim that has no weight by your standard because you will marry a lot of anyone but honestly it s like and also who A A cares she s like I m doing all this for minutes of my life and I m like why like why I love Kim like I love how ridiculous she is I just uh as a overall review of their reality show I m just saying for so many huge things happening in their life that only such a famous person would get to experience in this lifetime I don t feel like I m on the ride with them and I don t know if that s how they relay it or if it s not edited in a way like I feel more connected to a lot of YouTubers I watch that I m like going on an emotional Journey with this person that I don t feel with the Kardashians no I mean I feel it with Chloe sometimes I feel like Chloe s was the realist I get yes I was like that for a long time but it s a certain point I just started thinking like I understand when you re in a moment in your life where like it s sad and it s not here but it s like at some certain point instead of just talking about it all the time just opt out like I didn t want to go to her premiere don t go but then she like talked about it the whole time and I m like just don t like you don t have to you have enough money to stay in that house in Calabasas yeah just stay there run your clothing line it s a great clothing line the other thing that I think that people don t really understand is like because you ve been to like award shows and like we ve been in certain rooms that like a lot of people don t have access to and like around like huge money like crazy big money I m you re more than me I ve been in some very unique experience situations that don t make sense with Mom rooms those Brentwood mom rooms are A A crazy because they re all Reese wither not I mean it s not Reese Witherspoon like I ve lived in houses where they ve got Picasso paintings up and they re like you re not allowed to take pictures in here because we don t want people to know we have Picasso paintings though because we don t want to be robbed like crazy A A situations nuts when I used to work there and I would see how the teenagers it s crazy live their life yeah I would my mind almost exploded because I couldn t comprehend like at the Pinnacle of My Success living how these teenagers live honestly it s nuts when you think about the bills that they rack up it s like damn girl like that s what I m making a year that s just what I make in a year but that all that I m saying all of this to be like on the other side of it like as an outsider inside of it it s not that cool like I don t know how to explain it like yeah it s very comfortable but there s it s like it s not that different do you know what I m saying like it s just this item is more expensive but it s very similar to this item that s not that expensive I think the biggest difference with the financial element is the security if something goes wrong or being yeah those sorts of things are a different level I m talking about the superficial objects right and the emotional state of life and how you go through day to day feeling waking up existing yeah I m talking about just basic object A A it s not different you know what I mean and it s like and the more I get into these like higher up professional rooms even like you have this thing in your mind that says like oh I m not as good as so and so but then you sit in on someone says meeting and you re like oh no I am well because you re the difference between me and so and so is million dollars that s the difference and that you might be well that s not fair to say for everyone but I think the person the underdog might be working harder at that point right put and Crossing every detail yeah as opposed to somebody who s very successful and can kind of let things slide but I I do think that like the veil of the mystery of it all is like the mystery is that there is no mystery yeah and I just felt like even watching the Selena Gomez documentary I just felt sad I was like I I am glad that she could show such a candid side of herself yeah but I just wanted some like glimmer of hope for her like right I it was it was over the span of six years and I was like there s no moment where she s like giddy excited about anything yeah and I m like if you re not like I understand the music is a reflection of what you re going through and maybe it s not fun to promote that sort of music but it s like and she understands like she has this purpose of like a platform but I just feel like at some point if you re not getting enjoyment out of it or you re not enjoying the process or the things that come along with the process just stopped out for a while yeah just stop like if the whole process makes you miserable don t stop and find something that makes you Gideon smile like don t feel the weight of your world of the world on your shoulders to do something or be an example for someone if that makes you miserable yeah I think that s almost as awful as powering through being being unhappy and I mean who knows what they left in what they didn t I m sure there s moments of her life that are pure joy but I just felt like gosh I wish she could find something that really does bring her happiness yeah and maybe the philanthropy work did do that for her maybe she ll I think she seemed authentically proud of her philanthropy work in the school that she started and all of that stuff and I think that s huge but I just I loved her going back to her her middle school too and talking to those kids and I love the message that she imparted to them of you re the only one who can tell you no but it feels like to me it felt like it was not a burden to her but like not exciting like she s I still felt the weight of her like sadness through all of it yeah I think that I think that there s different I see I agree with what you re saying this wasn t gracious or happy to no no no I know that right but I m saying I think that in that moment because I could hear her voice quivering in the school when she s like you re the only person who can tell you no but I think more than anything for her that s the juxtapose position of where she came from and where she is right and that the quiver in her voice is oh my God like look how far I ve come like you re the only one who can tell you no and just like to tap into that just a tiny little bit like I definitely agree with that because even like what I was just saying were like the difference between me and that guy is million dollars but we re doing the same thing right like I don t have a lot I don t come from a lot and I m able to do exactly the same A A thing and I was trying to tell you this last night but there s like if you want something bad enough this is your goal but you re starting over here so all you have to do is take apart all the pieces that make your goal and realize what the first step you have to take is after you reverse engineer all of it and then just take one A A step at a time yeah to get to your goal yeah that s all it is you don t go from start to finish you take one step at a time and everything in between is how you get there yeah and if that goal makes you miserable once you re there it s okay to reevaluate exactly as well yeah and if you don t like the steps you have to take probably not the right goal for you yeah and wrapping it around to the Selena Gomez thing again I thought it was incredible how vulnerable she was and I appreciate what she showed to the world I just on a personal note hope she finds genuine happiness in this life same you know yeah um I think there was something else you put on about oh that she named her kidney or after someone oh yeah Fred Armisen Fred Armisen I always say his name really fast because I don t know how to actually say it I don t know what that is you don t know who that is of course then who cares well did you have sentiment to say about it I think it s a funny thing I did well she s like I hope he finds out about that and I think that s funny he s a celebrity he s a comic is on SNL importantly idea I ll just close my mouth say it I was gon na say don t think she should name it after Francia who gave it to her wow he went there I just sang I mean Francine Fred are close and who oh they are no I meant name wise they both start with F I actually I literally refused to dive into that drama and even see what it s about well and you never know the Arc of a friendship and what happened there but you know yeah I mean I honestly I doubt anything happened there but I didn t click on any of it there must have been something because she felt salty enough to make a comment about it what did she say well Selena was doing press somewhere and mentioned that she doesn t fit in with the Hollywood well that s in her documentary she says her only Hollywood friend is Taylor Swift yeah and then she Francia commented on that post somewhere and said like she made a comment I forgot what the actual statement was but she was like weird or awkward or some she made a statement on it because it s like well we are friends we ve always been friends I mean I don t know if they re friends right now and I gave you a kidney and it s like you know I would feel maybe I don t know what their falling out was like or what it was over I m sure Selena feels Justified I m sure Francia feels Justified yeah I mean I don t know like that might just be like a joke like also when Selena made that stuff I don t think so because then Selena came back out and just said like sorry I didn t mention everybody I ve ever known yeah right okay but that s what I m saying like I think you know to some degree she s in a documentary about music kind of right so she might be thinking like the only person in the music industry that I m friends with is Taylor Swift yeah Francia is not in the music industry okay she s an actress and quite frankly like a sense you know Make It or Break It I feel like I haven t heard a peep out of that A A she s in Hilary Duff s show yeah but that was like this year yeah so this is no she s always on some show she is I m good for her she s always consistently working on something she was the bad girl on making her break it but she s not the one that got pregnant we only have five minutes oh I m not very wrong ignore me oh really I was gon na say wow it s like we did cocaine and we re just smoking cigarettes and talking about kindergarten I ve my brain I m sorry you know I love

they re all me no they just said that in the in an episode of the Kardashians and I just think that s A A crazy A A wow delete them don t read them get a new number well if I understand in the sense of Kylie is of such use to a lot of people that if you have your use of use to people oh okay if you have Kylie Jenner s number and you need a favor you re probably going to take your shot shoot your shot and so I feel like with DMs I can relate in a certain way not that anyone has anything to gain from me but I don t the pressure of opening DMS is too much for me that I just leave them unread and maybe she feels subconsciously by not reading them she s not being as like well I ve got to read it so I m not like being as rude not replying especially when I think that it might be you asking me for something right or she just has crazy group chats they re blowing up it s just all me it s every thought I ve ever had okay I didn t see this but I saw it going viral everywhere did you watch this episode I understand Rihanna did a song for a soundtrack but don t you think she could have released a Bop for all of us as well isn t she like retired from music well that s what I m saying it s been a million years and then she came back with granted I think she should have done the soundtrack but also give us like a Rihanna Pop I mean I don t know did you you didn t see it that was like a movie it was shot on a beach with a red camera it was fine I m talking about the show The Savage Fenty show oh I m talking about her music video oh I don t know what you re talking about no what do you mean oh you did for the first time in forever she released a single and she was promoting it like I have a single coming I have a single coming and then it was a movie soundtrack which great I m not knocking but I just wish that while doing that she would also make a song that s like a classic Rihanna song was that the song for the Black Panther yeah okay I think the director like harassed her into making is what I understood from an interview hmm not actually harassed her no but yes like pressured her very hard to do it and I understand artists doing that I get it but I also just like if she s going to do it like also give us a bump you know I don t see the correlation I do she like her coming everyone has been asking her when she s coming back to music for a decade right and then she teases her coming back to move music and it s like a movie where she s just like going along she looks beautiful but it s just like you want more you want a more from Batgirl yeah I get it she s but if you like honestly that Savage Bunty show like that woman has single handedly put to shame every A A loser ass Victoria s Secret show that did you watch it yeah and it made me feel inspired and empowered and A A like you watched the whole thing I mean I had it on while I was editing but it s sick it s sickening like it kept drawing my attention I was like damn this woman is really A A done something here I want to take back whatever and that s what I want to feel about in my panties I want to be like because I just told Selena Gomez if music doesn t make you happy and you re miserable during every point of the process hey Rihanna if you re miserable making music and it s not fun for you and you love being a billionaire making clothing you know what good for you and you are doing great for the world Thrive girl Thrive you know what I take back everything I said Riri I was always on your side just keep being you bad girl never forgot Lizzie was the one who had your back from the get go and so what was this Johnny Depp appearance he just he walked the runway and like he was invited to actually he s just like walking so she s team Johnny I think everybody s team Johnny oh yeah the courts have ruled in his favor he s back baby isn t it crazy that that was the Talk of the Town for months and months and months and I can t even remember any of the details anymore that is a crazy thing about you that is definitely a crazy specific to you craziness wild right good for everyone that has but what is Mike s way I ll never be able to tell you hey Jersey Mike s hot tip just put like a Mike s way button on doordash postmate GrubHub anywhere you can order food they do no they don t they do they don t I literally ordered it today and there wasn t a button in the Jersey Mike s app there is I don t know about doors who goes you have the Jersey Mike s app yeah you guys are nuts I prefer doordash because they re a big sponsor of our show okay brat what am I being brought you need to blow doordashes I blow you doordash I actually use doordash all the time though oh really did you use our code and I love it look it up in the description section below use it Riley doesn t like what I say that I used to use doordash to get cigarettes okay Lindsay lohans you put Lindsay Logan s Christmas I know I m not about to like fix that autocorrect okay so tell me about it did you finish it did you go back I I didn t even I was in and out wow I was in and out you you know I love Jane you guys are so I loved it you need to respect no I loved it I m so proud of her I m inspired by her she seems like a normal person again I planted the seed again yeah she was off her rocker for a good while on her it is nice to see that she is of like the mental state seems like she wants oh I don t actually know she just seemed faded like she seemed well maybe yeah that s what I m saying and not and to me this seems like a coherent woman who is of sober mind and body and she was recently married I think she s really just found peace yeah and A A I m so happy for her I planted the seed right once I found out it was available to Shane all day long I was like the movie s out we re gon na watch the movie tonight are you excited for our movie night every hour I d be like we re having a movie night I love you and so I watched the whole thing I enjoyed it I thought it was really cute I thought it was really well done Christmas movie yeah I mean come in comparison to a lot of those other like hallmarky movies it s definitely gon na live in the shadow of ours unfortunately most of them will but it s still right up there not me being like I hate when people are so cocky about what they re making like just surprise them with how great it is did you finish the script I m so close I m I ve been asked A A Chris dude I was working in the car on the way here okay I m very busy okay I m happy for Lindsay I m glad it s out it s you know yeah I love her okay um any of these other things that you want to talk about see them no oh what was this the Facebook status and the demilios oh Dixie and A A Noah are officially done really yeah that s a reality show I finished yeah can you believe that can you believe that yeah I did I always I started we don t have a Jacuzzi I start strong with the like Kardashians every season I m like oh I m gon na do it and then after four episodes I never go back yeah the demilios I finished the whole thing was because they come out with two at a time which is nice we never talked about this what yeah we did not the end of the demilio it s not on our show oh we had a private conversation off camera there s another thing would you like to bring it to the SIP oh yeah what about did I say something bad no but neither of us felt good about that music video at the end of it well here s the thing also did was anyone talking about Charlie s music video at the end of and that s even if it okay well it wasn t amazing and I say that because I feel like she was trying to kind of rip off Olivia Rodrigo s song can I say something that s deeply concerning for me I honestly thought that Charlie s acting was going to be good and then after seeing the music video I think it s not the case I feel like it s different though uh acting in a movie versus a music video like it s not I think it s easier to act in a music video though because the music for me music makes me very emotional well maybe her song didn t do that for her I mean she wrote it her A A self and it s like about her big feelings for a guy that doesn t have feelings no she said it wasn t in she said did you not watch the show maybe but it wasn t a storyline in her life but she wrote the A A song allegedly allegedly it s from your A A life you know I actually helped myself it s not about little Hootie from the little hook that or I don t know music from the little thing that they teased in every episode leading up to its release I thought I was really gon na like this song because I liked that little voice like I couldn t even tell you a lyric from it no me either and so many Dixie songs I could tell you lyrics from yeah yeah you know well you are hard for Dixie I m a little hard for Dixie I think she works really hard I think she works really hard and I love a good crazy A A like I m out of my A A mind no I think so too I just think it s interesting even if the song isn t good music is objective yeah um I is that music subjective yeah um it s just another example of tick tock doesn t translate to other places no because she s the biggest tick Tucker in the world and the music video only had a million views in the first week and I just thought how is that possible yeah like even if it s awful like wouldn t you think these hundreds of millions of people would at least be curious to see what s going on literally a hundred million people over million people crazy they re not not even a Second Glance from them not even a first glance from some of us but yeah um so I but I wanted to talk about how Dixie and uh Noah are officially done and I was thinking about remember time on Facebook when it s like I m officially done with my boyfriend now single status changed I hope you know that means I mean business I wouldn t know because I never got to that point because I was gay and never got in a gay relationship oh so you never even like had emotional trauma with a girl where you guys were like girls were always trying to make it official with me but things weren t clicking weird on my end so it never happened wow so I never got to do that like in a relationship on Facebook oh are you anyone now yeah on Facebook oh no we don t Facebook oh you Facebook no I don t I thought you did what I thought you just think I m over here on Facebook I thought you were yeah what do you mean I feel like you told me you re on Facebook a few times why would we be talking about Facebook I just feel like sometimes you re like well I was on Facebook the other day but are you am I only need Facebook even if I were to scroll are people from high school yeah and I feel like that s something we were talking about am I wrong every once in a while I ll scroll to see what those people are doing see that s what you said that s what you A A said but post on Facebook or like something on Facebook or comment on Facebook Over My Dead Body how about you Chris have you ever emotionally terrorized someone with your Facebook relationship status uh I don t think so just me I don t yeah all right okay are you in a relationship on Facebook I m not on Facebook you aren t no Chris I know it s an hour into the show but do you have anything to say oh God about anything or Facebook I m on I have a Facebook I barely ever use it ever wow that s black panther made me cry that s all I have to say all right any other things you want to hit on before we say goodbye to everyone I don t know so I think we hit everything um John come back to this I mean we ve got three minutes left on the clock do you want to say anything I don t know we ll come back next week because we ll still be here you re done talking no are you I don t know why are you putting this on me all right you guys well thank you so much for watching today s episode of the Sip I hope you enjoyed it oh you know what we didn t talk about what my A A goddaughter s birthday oh

were no options left you can pick the seats yeah and you didn t think you just needed it s okay if you needed a little me time no there s no open seats for not additional money okay I wouldn t mind if you would have splurged a little actually I would have thoughts were really expensive for some reason yeah like outrageously expensive and I had to get us I did have to pay more for one of the seats wow all right we should check in for our flight in the middle of the podcast I forgot that I had gotten these really beautiful sashes and crowns for our th episode and we forgot to wear them so we re making up for lost time yeah and if you can see the balloon bouquet was so much work that we thought why not just make it say although I think that that s not a one that s a I don t think they can even see the but here s the deal guys what I mean if we we should do this for every episode new new balloons just celebrate no this was the worst experience and not the worst experience it was worth it but I don t know if had Chris not been here today yeah I would have had a full blunt I would have held down I don t know every time I ask you for help you re like I m doing things too and I m like like we re trying to leave for lunch and Lizzie s like I ll be in the car I m like I have to upload the previous footage I have to take my dogs out I have to make sure that there s nothing my dogs can chew she s like can we go yet I m like Lizzy I know everyone s having a good nice chat like well it s time if we don t leave now we can t go to lunch at all and I m like yeah we don t have five more

God the fried fried pickles so the waitress has uh experienced us on multiple occasions now she s starting to realize it s a recurring theme yeah and she goes wow you guys sure do love the pickles and Lizzy s like I all the way from Los Angeles where it s pickles that takes it even to our next to the next level and she did confirm that air frying the pickles does check out hell yeah next time and Chris you got to meet the alpacas oh my God okay they re obviously cute like you see a video of them you know you can see how cute they are and it melts your heart but something about them in person their eyes looking in their mind I like nearly cried what did I tell you about this morning what you guys were talking about my alpacas yeah remember I told you they ll make you think that you forgot you forgot A A you don t it was crazy live this morning because you re still alive right now you kept texting in the group chat and Chris wasn t responding so then when you finally called me because you had there was a misunderstanding because I said you know I m not picking you up right and then how about Lizzy calling me in his panic and mad at me because she read it wrong and thought I was picking her up she was mad at me I was like well you better A A not be she s like this is iron called an Uber this is real annoying because now I ve called an Uber and I m like no read the text again I m not picking you up and I m never gon na pick you up I was like how that I m annoyed that you would come get me I like that we re there yeah I mean I was like I ve assumed I d never see you here again and you will and I won t that s okay there s two times I was being nice it s a lot I do set up while you re on your way here like so once you re once you arrive it s just like sit in right I mean I d pick you up from Burbank any day you asked me to and I would drive you to Calabasas which which is out of my way and I would drop you off that s something and I just leave and that is I want to highlight one of your personality traits that is very good and how did you go out of your way to do things like that which I will not like airports are a no fly zone for me no no fly zone for me but they re like a no go like hardly ever will I go pick somebody up from an airport I m like there s Uber for a reason you know my friend Montana what our entire relationship was predicated on me driving him to and from LAX when we were new in L A I have a Christmas video from years ago where you two are dropping me off at LAX I m not kidding I was going through all my old videos the other day and before I even did YouTube I like was vlogging I guess I knew what vlogging I actually know what you re talking about I thought we were dropping Montana off with my flip camera no you guys were taking you were dropping me off to come to Colorado to visit my family for Christmas where did I have Montana in the car I don t know was I also dropping him off for to go to Chicago maybe we got ta watch this Vlog we ll watch it wow it s a throwback it is copywritten music in it because I didn t know you could be monetized on YouTube yeah you and Montana are my oldest La friends wow you Montana and Mao none of these people know those people good point this is too inside wow Mal was in my vlogoween oh she s a spooky storytelling Queen okay Val Mal it s Mal that s actually how we become friends I didn t even know this A A we were both at the Groundlings and she missed the second class and someone kept going Mel is Mel here and I was like it s Mal as if I knew her didn t know her I just thought she was cool when she came to the class so when she wasn t there I felt the need to stand up for Mal now everything I write there s a Mal character or a Mallory and it s all her okay if you re not gon na name me after one of your dogs after I ve named you after one of my alpacas at least two weeks ago I know but I m saying if you re naming characters now A A entire movie starring you about you for you thank you yeah I guess I am a movie star psycho I can t wait to be a movie star me neither honestly I m living for our fourth chapter in life which is us just doing like you know how like in the movie Elvis they say that like his sad years were all those horrible movies he did those are gon na be our goals and here s the thing like I get rubbed the wrong way when somebody s making a movie and they re promoting it as if it s a godsend whereas I think we re very realistic about our dreams and then I hope when it lands we ll surprise people with how good it is instead of being like well now it won t be a surprise I want to like humbly take wherever we can go and we re just gon na like put our heads down and do the work and then when people get to enjoy it what sorry I thought my favorite slides were sliced in half but I m still thinking they are sorry it could be an optical illusion if it s not I m gon na have a full blown panic I just saw the whole thing it s it s good okay I don t even know where we were going oh I well we weren t going anywhere all right well do you want to talk about your spooky car morning I don t even know yeah actually this is a hard left turn to like legitimately terrifying no yeah so you know how I leave at the ass crocodone to get here it s dark outside every morning and I m like oh my God every shadow is someone coming to get me in like some into human trafficking or whatever yeah cause nobody drops you off at the airport either no I have to drive and walk in the darkness you how much is it to pay there it s embarrassing for one day could you just pay the ten dollars it s like bucks pretty expensive but it s also I don t think a shorter walking oh it s definitely shorter walking no it is A A annoying at Burbank because you have to go up an escalator and then it makes you do like a walk around to the structure yeah it s like almost the same distance walk maybe a little safer maybe not I don t know I m not really parking lots too yeah um at any rate I have noticed the past few mornings that when I leave at like a m there is a lingering smell of like fresh cigarette smoke which I think is weird at your house or at the airport at my house outside my house well are the boys still smoking no no one in my house smokes cigarettes anymore how did they quit because they were well they re still using nicotine products they re they re puffing on Vapes like douche bags but um but yeah like the past the past few like it s been a few times for me to like make a comment about it because it s like okay I m gon na note it it s weird it smells like cigarettes maybe someone s in a work fan somewhere and also maybe someone s in a work fan somewhere and this is their schedule they wake up early in the morning to go to work and that s why I m smelling the cigarettes and so it just it smells so fresh it s just a little Eerie you know what I mean it s like someone just smoked a cigarette just put a cigarette out near very near to my front door do you like the second hand smell more than anything I don t like the feeling that somebody is on my front porch in the middle of the night smoking a cigarette okay that s what I m afraid of right it s not it s not relapsing it s well that s not what I was talking about I ve never I m sorry I don t I won t derail your story well so that s spooky and then I got into my car to leave this morning and all women are terrified to get into cars when it s dark out they check all the front the back seat the front seat the trunk all of it underneath the car so your accountant doesn t get slapped you check the handle to make sure there s nothing on the handle that when you touch it it s going to render you unconscious like a bunch of A A you got to worry about a lot of A A and there s a lot of things that people could hide under inside of your car yeah you re a messy woman in the car no my car s clean but I don t believe it oh I don t believe it we ll get to it I need photo evidence you ll get it I ll send it to you the second I get home okay so I get in my car I throw my luggage in the back seat on the PA on the driver s side so I opened the driver s side back seat door and I opened the driver s door and I shut both Chris is yawning I m probably gon na be abducted you guys are such A A A A and when I go missing and this is what s online you re gon na feel like real douchebags no I m really interested I just woke I got like two hours of sleep I m very tired back to the normal so I shut the doors and you know I m a Slammer there s not a door I don t slam you re always telling me to take it easy you know what I m saying I slammed my the back door my door and a door still open I go that s weird I reshut my door a door s still open you know the lights on so I get out and I shut the passenger door those are the only two doors I opened and I shut both very hard and they re still a door open and then I go around the other side of the car and it s the passenger side of the back back that was open I ve I never opened that door there s no reason for me to ever open that door I m the only one who like drives my car do you leave your windows down a little at night I don t leave my windows down a little at night I will confess sometimes I don t like like lock my car because I don t think of it because in my mind I m like I think my car automatically locks I don t know but so the back door on the passenger side was open and that s weird as A A and my Orange Theory armband is gone and that was the only thing that was out in the car was the car expensive yeah well who knows what the A A it is like another housewife is roaming my neighborhood smoking cigarettes at am just to be a little A A Orangetheory armbands that are registered in my name like oh is is that how that works I ve always rented it because isn t it up front a hundred and something dollars it s like but if you go well if you go all the time I know because it s three dollars a time to rent Oh I thought it was like twelve dollars a number whatever I don t know but regardless someone A A took mine I think I got ta really look in my car but I think someone took mine you need to start locking your car well duh I also don t want to A A park my car on the street anymore but that s A A weird right yeah my car is literally spotless right now sorry I m puking pickles but that s A A weird if you find your Orange Theory band it s still weird that my back door was open though very even if I find my Orange Theory fit are you parking on the street or in your driveway I m parking on the street I mean right in front of my house that s not stopping anyone I know my my parents had left their garage door open once one night on accident and somebody had stole my dad s truck Jesus they luckily because the trucks have GPS yeah my dad was able to just show the police the GPS of the car and they were able to go get it right away is this his new truck or the old one I mean the new one but he s had it for like four years now wow but yeah I mean even in safe neighborhoods I don t think anyone s above like doing drive bys and checking doors right so you definitely need to be locking your doors yeah I mean it s the for me it s the combination of the lingering cigarette smoke in my door being open that s really A A do you think it s your neighbors like that lady that was once spying on you is like out on her front porch smoking in the morning she was never spying on it okay she was just in her house looking through her window and I happened to look out my window at the same same time we were both like icky loves Ronnie she s not spying on us but it was weird it was A A weird it stressed me out but my car is A A and A A span right now not a A A Speck of trash or A A in it so they could probably see your Orange Theory band and thought who wants to steal an orange theory armband it s such a specific yeah it gives me rashes is it is it GPS trackable so you can see if they used it no oh someone would know if they used it but I don t think they know what they took it probably they just probably think oh this is a Fitbit but they re going to be like disappointed as A A when they find out they stole something that s integral to my life and can do nothing to them I hope I find it in the car but yeah Joe so here was the other thing I want to talk about Joe s a A A superhero okay you know I ve been directing those things yeah Joe took my car without telling me while I was working and I would never know because I m just in a dark room for A A hours and took it cleaned all of the A A out of it and got it detailed he s a cleaning fiend he is and remember when we were joking like he better be steaming the floors he was steaming the floors I m serious yeah does he love this I think he s just a good man who deserves his dick sucked I m sorry Mark gon na have to do that tonight sorry Marge his mother is watching you owe him three Marge has started texting me little like sneaky things like she knows I know she s listening that s fine you can stay Marge she knows but this is the type of A A you have to hear this is the over showing I talked about in last episode you brought it up you were the ones our lunches get dinner it was the same sort of thing and I m starting to think when Chris what happened it s real dirty you don t remember in the middle of that restaurant when we started talking crazy wait why is it my fault what were you talking about you sick A A about top and bottom preferences and how it all works out wow I think I black out when you guys talk you were the one bringing it up oh and then you guys answered I can t and then I blacked out I give this woman any ounce of food and she s done for the day like we go to lunch and it s like no more use of Lizzy for the day I got back and I m like okay so I pulled all these wonderful advice those submissions and I m just like reading and I even make headlines for them so I can like pitch the headline to her yeah yeah and I m like Chris I need some help and she s like yeah Chris we need some help so then Chris this is like the most official production meeting we ve ever had all three of us sitting in the circle in my office on different chairs and Chris is like reading the submissions and like checking off what we re gon na talk about on today s show we are better with Chris here we re very much so better with Chris yeah I had fun I guess he can stay fine we ll keep him we don t perform as well without you we really don t okay sometimes I sit here you just go I don t think I have any thoughts today Music and then we just blink at each other and throat laugh and we re like and that s the sit oh that s the whole show I ve been trying to get my life together no way you know I ve been wearing the same v necks that I know the podcast people audience the audience knows as well because they re like time to retire that shirt and you know what it might be time to retire at this monologue we ve heard it verbatim a few times you can play the records back oh I say it with like love I say it with love with a full belly of Love okay A A me then no no no gun if you have something to say no I m saying we can retire it because drum roll well I figured if I m never actually gon na go shopping I ll online shop yeah so I invested some time in myself this weekend and I online shopped and you know what I got some really cute things I hit the purple one okay Laughter Applause we re gon na get some cute sweaters and I thought well Lizzy s always talking about Abercrombie so I checked out Abercrombie and actually when you got here today all of them arrived but it arrived in a Hollister back and I was like I didn t have a Hollister turns out it s Abercrombie what a dick tease but okay where I have to like confess to you yeah you know when you were shopping for me we were like I should invest in some like good quality sneakers and they didn t have I have like fat feet wide fat feet so it s hard for me to find a shoe that works for me that s casual and cute and delicious this is all we talk about on wikiFeet on your page Laughter and so I ordered those shoes that all the celebrities get A A for wearing oh the that s why golden geese is on there yeah why do they get shiffer just because they look just because they re so yeah they re like women s shoes no they re for all sorts of people yes I mean mainly women celebrities wear them but the boys too but I was Googling like sneakers that run wide and it said that their sneakers run wide oh and I do think they re really cute but every I don t know my phone like targets crazy Footwear did you get like metallic gold ones no I just got like distressed white leather with like some black strips and it has like the star on it they re cute how much were they I don t want to tell you I want to know no this is the problem but they were no more expensive than the ones we were trying to buy at Nordstrom that were a brand that I had never heard about right and those were wildly expensive exactly were these seven hundred dollars no were they they were they were yeah but I thought if I m gon na wear them I mean I ve had these I was wearing these shoes in our picture that I posted on Instagram from when we started the podcast two years ago so when I find when I find a shoe I like I wear it for a long time yeah so I m hoping that there ll be a match but then I m like oh am I like really gon na be a douchebag walking around in public because all the headlines I see about those shoes are like not this celebrity wearing this shoe again do you get the shoe articles in your Apple news no oh just me yeah okay interesting if you don t like them I ll take I m gon na be looking sickening I got this I ve never had a long puffer like uh past your knee length yeah and it has like a little throat ooh zip up too so when I m walking is this from Abercrombie no Zara nice yeah I want to see your house I did some damage damn Daddy and I m so excited I haven t bought clothes for probably ever since our Vlog I deserved it yeah so I mean you never buy a clothes and I m always saying like I need new shirts for the podcast some company sent me this so this is good that s a goodie yeah that s a goody hoodie they re really cute actually they re giving everyone off if it isn t I could I ll put it in the link code Rylan yeah put Rylan for off feet yeah they re not his feet but they are somebody else f e a t oh did you want to talk about the birthday party you ve been planning for six months finally coming to fruition it did come to fruition and tell us the theme I hate a theme party okay so it was uh so it s Shannon s last year in her s she s and uh it s it was a roaring theme and it was a murder mystery party so we bought a kit sounds fun no I like hearing about it but I don t I wouldn t want to be there well I was really excited I ve never done an actual murder mystery theme kit and I really like there was a game yes everybody played a character I was holiday is it like clue yes oh that is kind of funny and you re a character within the game but I thought that there would be some like you know mafia s super fun so fun because it s all lying and strategy and you have to really listen to people in real fights that affect my real relationship absolutely same I love it I want to do that for my birthday this year don t invite Shane he takes it personally she s totally invited I m saying he s not you guys are actually hosting it at your Calabasas house that s fine okay it ll be themed he won t be there if we re playing mafia I hurt people s feelings I m telling you I will threaten things I don t even know what that is oh crit for those of you listening that don t know about the game Mafia every like a group of people gets together and they put in a fishbowl either you re a townsperson or there are two people who are Mafia and one person who s a detective and then one person who leads the game everybody closes their eyes the mafia opens their eyes they kill someone in the group and then the townspeople have to discover who the mafia is correctly yeah so they go around and they say I think it s A A you and you have to defend yourself and so if you re the mafia you have to like swear up and down it s not you all like threatened to like pick up someone s room for three weeks if I m wrong I ll like really go crazy stand on table start screaming experts would call that a tell um but that s what I thought it was going to be like and it was not that we each had like a script where it s like you can only ask people these two questions and then they had a scripted response so I was like so even though the Killer Is Random it could be it s none of this is you know what I mean like it s all predetermined but nobody knew that it was predetermined I mean it s only predetermined because it s scripted but no matter what you still don t know who the Killer is because you pull a number out and if your number comes out and it has an x on it it means you re the killer okay and so there s even there s two responses there s like if you re the killer this is your response if you re not the killer this is not your response but there s no strategy to it because because you re told what to do yeah so it takes the fun out of it I thought so but it was still really fun because everyone like comes in character the outfits were cute yeah and the thing that was fun was like when you guess who you think did it you have to say why for yourself so that was the only part that to me creative yeah other than that like my ADHD was like I can t do this you know can we scrap it and play Mafia yeah I wanted to be like obvious I was like just saying people like listen it s not me it s just not me I made beautiful charcuterie boards beautiful chicory Awards okay so good I could have eaten all of them by myself great conversation awesome conversations okay great costumes everybody committed the A A out of their characters I couldn t be friends with you guys well that s working for my birthday and if you A A it up I swear to God I ll play Mafia in character well if I give you my credit card will you order my costume I m having a theme party I know that s what I m saying I can t order my costume fine but you have to wear whatever I order you I m fine it s a penis and a boob plate you want a breastplate penis I don t care thank you no I probably can t handle a theme okay I also like to have a party where I can leave it you know what I m saying Laughter I am not hosting your guess after you ve left if you re sneaking out like you did at your wedding which valid everyone sneaks out of their wedding I ve been to like three I wouldn t know I avoid them like the plague did your brother stay till everybody left his wedding uh no no yeah I guess there is like that exit moment where there s like the things and the people exit and then other guests are like well A A me I m stuck here now to do what on my th birthday I was like I want a big party so Joe threw me a huge party and I did ecstasy and didn t want to leave the bedroom and then he was like I m never throwing you a party again you crazy A A because I was just in the bed all night listening to Hamilton on repeat holding my playbill thank God Shane came into my life because I before Shane I would like didn t know if I wanted a party or didn t want to party or wanted a party I d go back and forth a million times then I wouldn t plan anything and then I d be upset that nothing was planned but it s my fault because everyone asked if I wanted to do something so like I m not good for a birthday I I really like an intimate situation or I like something that I can plan right I do remember a theme of me as being underdressed because the last time I went to like one of your friend birthday brunches I showed up and you re like that s what you were oh I said that to you I was like yeah it s like jean shorts and a t shirt everyone s like dressed up as like it s brunch on Saturday it was my golden birthday you piece of A A you want to invite me somewhere know that I m not getting dressed up well that was also like a like that was a big day so we started with a spin class at evolve and then we went to brunch

me right now we just had a break you could have taken a break all right iced tea hold on I m burping I m really coming undone okay come on keep it together should we make crystals these two no I don t ever want to have crumble cookies again you were the one that demanded them and I thought because Lizzy texts me every week did you try the crumble cookies and I go yeah no which never even replies because it s like it s too much and then you said did you try this one and I m like I don t I think I didn t get that one and you re like you did and I m like I don t I know you do because I watched you eat it online you can t lie to me when you re Snapchatting your whole life okay for all of your followers so then why didn t you get my reaction there I didn t see it there I just knew you had it because I saw someone else post and you were there well I m following all of this so then Lizzy goes can we get it and I know her like most hated thing is eating on the podcast and I was like so do you just want crumble cookies or do you want the for the podcast I was very confused it s for both okay but now you re like complaining about it yeah bubble guts okay stop it you re acting like a child you need Chris to stand in for you the rest of the episode okay I m sure the potions would love that too just stop it turn your phone over and focus I m working they hate it when you look at your phone they do how do they know yes they do we feel disrespected when that happens you guys like we re not good enough no you re not you have two other boys in that house I m working four jobs right now we all know men are good for nothing though right except for my husband Taylor she really likes him today I he has literally been on a roll okay like I m like damn thank God I married this dude okay Taylor my Taylor Swift yoga class LOL oh yeah that s me uh I ve never been more excited for like I think I like the release days more than I like the albums it s so funny bullied me for minutes and then we re like oh right that s me well if you weren t ready to record we could have taken five I was ready because you poisoned me you were like I have a story as soon as we start rolling it s like not a story you want us to smell your A A no I I want no one to smell my A A I just wanted you to the guy like because I don t want to be the one who s like in an Uber or in someone s house just constantly farting and we re not getting anything like somebody else I think it was cheetah s litter box which is my fault then why was it also in the Uber I m just kidding okay so leading up to the day yeah of Taylor Swift s album really yeah I kept asking everyone around me like aren t you so excited and they re like what and I m like you guys suck and so the next day the one person who does get it is the the yoga studio and she did a whole the it was the teacher I took you to a class I love her yeah she did a whole Taylor Swift class she did like two songs from every album including the new album it was so much fun I felt like I got to celebrate can we request that what do you mean next time I come in I spend the night can we request that yeah I m sure honestly we probably could it was very fun can we was packed there were like people in that club did they all care about t swift yeah like it was they never play Taylor Swift Orange Theory and I think it s a A A travesty well you should are you not close to any of the instructors yet no I m like scared to talk to people that s me tune most the time this one instructor is very nice though she is very nice um so yeah it was very fun I loved the day leading up to it and the yoga class was so much fun I loved a theme I love a theme to class when I know it s themed like when we went oh what was it Michael Jackson and it was also just bad it was just a bad it was bad it was bad it was we didn t know we were signing up for an hour of Michael Jackson at like volume and the instructor didn t shut the A A up just kept scream talking I was literally plugging my ears like hoping she would see so that she would turn the A A volume down we never leave anything and we were on the brink of leeches um anyways the Vigilante A A and Karma so there are a few speculative things this is a little late by now but I m sure it s still fun to discuss but here s what I like to think about I mean I don t even like to think about it but there are a couple of things that people are saying so it s either scooter Brawn and his wife or Kanye and his wife ex wife Kim yeah sorry if I had a booger this whole time I haven t lost one too you re kidding me no okay I can t see you I have no glasses on okay but that s for every time you didn t tell me about the lipstick on my teeth this is five minutes and we haven t got to our first story I m on it so I think it s Kim and Kanye I don t think there s enough proof to back up the bronze A A I think she has more current beef with the bronze and it they did recently go through a divorce okay right but I saw a tick tock that literally has photographic evidence of Kim leaving a place with a dossier from Taylor Swift I m assuming I m connecting that thought okay and Kim and in yay s Benz Kim got the A A kids like every lyric adds up but I don t think I mean dressing for revenge like picture me thick as thieves with your ex wife I think she s more likely to be thick as thieves with scooter bronze ex wife than Kim like she still pulled some like petty A A albums on Kim s birthday she knew what she was doing that s like yeah we ll see and then that s another piece of it and she didn t post it on scooter Ron s wife s birthday well there s less of a there s less of something to pick with scooter Ron s wife right so why she hates Peter Braun not his wife there s she doesn t hate Kim she hates Kanye I think there s always I think there s pictures of her there s pictures of her and Kim on the internet but then why would she take away Kim s day from her she could have posted this album on any day is this literally the end of our relationship what do you mean this argument like we this is where it ends well okay here s apparently it was and vigilante A A she needed cold hard proof so I I gave her some envelope handed her the envelope uh where you think she got it from now she gets the house scooter bronze ex wife kids the kids got the house Kim got the kids gets the pride picture yeah he s been dropped by everybody because he s an anti semitic piece of A A yeah that happened after this song was written that did happen after the song was written but also like he s been disgraced from like well before yeah yeah I guess it doesn t matter either way I think it s more exciting if it s about scurobrine and his ex wife I think it s exciting if it s fake as A A about no one what I think is hilarious is because Taylor Swift is notorious for planting these Easter eggs in her lyrics in her music videos and her promotion everything yeah calculated as A A I it s very funny to see the headlines about this album both negative and positive like some of what are the negative ones I like don t even want to go into it because then I m gon na be like ready I ve seen not a negative thing inside really yeah wow I haven t been looking either I m just obsessed I A A I A A with this A A so heavy so heavy I did not like her promotion for the release you thought it was annoying the like I like Taylor Swift and I think the woman can put on a show I loved nothing more than going to her reputation tour do you want to go to tour with me um I need to give this did you listen to the am version yeah of course I bought the am version okay I still don t know why you can t just get a Spotify subscription or apple I like to buy the things I listen to okay that s very nice of you know how to work other technology I m going to be completely honest all right um this is too old right this is very iced tea so if you re hot out there because your wife s got the heater turned up in the house uh and you need something to cool off with let s talk about Travis and Kylie what s going on I saw the headlines but I couldn t I couldn t care enough to look into it well there s a couple of things both of which are very old news the first of which is some girl on Tick Tock says she thinks the baby s name is Christian okay I saw that because she went down like something that we re like yeah the the what do you call that copyright the things that they re copywriting or patenting yeah yeah and they ve patented and copyrighted I don t think I care like whenever she tells us the name of the baby then we ll know the name of the baby yeah I m not very pressed about like what I ve lost interest quite frankly yeah I lost interest in both the baby s names I forgot Chloe had a son is that the her new baby was a boy okay um so that s that s one part of the drama the other part of the drama is that uh Travis has had a side girlfriend their entire relationship that he keeps secret you re saying that as it s true I think um so there s a woman who s been posting images that correlate with uh tiger with Travis s locations over a period of years and she posted that she was on a music video set that Travis was directing recently and uh came out as like his other his other woman and he who responds to nothing online virtually nothing online instantly took to Instagram I was like I don t know that A A she was on that set without my permission like wrote a A A song about it didn t write a song about it I m just tired but he yeah he addressed it immediately and then she went online and she was like on a live she s like God imagine pretending like you don t know someone who has naked photos and videos of you like imagine oh these Kardashian girls I think Kylie s aware of it okay because the woman keeps saying I played nice I posted whatever stories you wanted me to post like said whatever you wanted me to say publicly what do you the address yeah why would she need to say anything publicly is she a public figure um I mean she has a following on Instagram I just don t know why he would request his mistress post anything I know I think that s weird too but I think it s more like don t post oh and uh but it goes pretty deep and there s like you know to some degree I m like any like one of the things that she s claiming is like she ll post a picture in a room with a pair of sneakers that look like Travis s Sneakers but it s like they re not one of a kind sneakers that have like dog A A on the same part of the shoe that Travis has stepped in dog A A and it s just the same sneaker and granted it s not like it s a it s a van like a slip on old school van it but it is a A A like Nike Air Jordan type of shoe that everybody has access to I guess I just don t know like I know more about Chloe s situation I feel like it s more publicized yeah I don t know I feel like Kylie has always seemed to be like on and off again with this man so I don t even know does it matter I hope she s happy yeah I hope they re all happy okay all three of us are like wake up A A stop yawning they re contagious if you yawn again Chris I m cutting your toes off okay if they re okay this is actually one okay come on this is a good one listen up being honest when someone has substance abuse problems can be very hard but Jennifer Aniston was always there to call Matthew Perry out on his um A A when he was using so Matthew Perry recently wrote an autobiography and in it he details his substance abuse problem okay and uh like some details include that he spent like up to nine million dollars on trying to get sober like he went through it and he was at the peak of his Fame suffering from a hardcore pill addiction alone isolated and using in his house and you know a lot of people sort of steered clear of him didn t know how to handle it didn t feel confident being like hey man are you using again or you know being like hey I know you re using again yeah or being open and honest with him they would just avoid him Jennifer Aniston would always take the call and always be like hey are you using again and I think that s a really hard thing to do and it s really scary and it s like what is the right thing to do yeah how can I be there for somebody that I love who is suffering from substance abuse problems they re not only friends but they re on a hit TV show that relies on their relationship being okay like you don t want to call somebody out that s going to take it the wrong way and then ruin the TV show for everyone yeah and I think that not only that but not calling out someone who is uh dying of a substance abuse problem because let s be real there s three options it s institutionalized insanity or death without treatment yeah are like incarcerated you know yeah uh those are your options and did he detail like how she did it I haven t read the book I haven t read the book but she was always the one who was like on the phone when she would take the call would say I know you re using again like I can tell you re using so it was just this sort of honest thing where it s like we re not gon na A A foot around it I m not gon na enable your using by pretending you re not doing it I m going to say I know you re using again yeah and I love you and this doesn t work right it doesn t work for me and you know I ve had friends who use and who don t stop using and I have said similarly like listen like I love you I m uh when you re ready to get sober please call me because I can help you and in until that time like you know I m I m really gon na miss you and I wish you well and I hope that you get there soon yeah but it s so hard to walk the fine line of like love and lethal enabling because the the God s honest truth is if you lie with someone about their substance abuse by by allowing yourself to be too uncomfortable to speak the truth you are helping kill them and I m sure everyone pretty much everyone in his life had something to gain by keeping him functioning keeping him happy not calling him out on his problem yeah because and you also want to shake the Beast of what was this massive success of a show and I m not talking about like pointing fingers and being like you re A A up like that s not what I m saying I m just saying hey elephant in the room I know you re using I love you this doesn t work for me I want you to be well this is not well that s it all right yeah Got ta Love Jen got ta love John I love her so much her hair is incredible I wonder if she gets Keratin treatments well she started a hair care company what why aren t we talking about that do you not follow her I do follow her but my Instagram shows me A A strangers oh that s so annoying it s so A A annoying I m like I don t give a A A about this person I follow people I care about show me them Instagram I m livid she has a hair care line that I don t A A know about yeah like low Levy or lavove okay well another idea for Christmas um moving on you wanted to talk about this so you want to talk about it you bring it I d rather get to advice though really something you really want to talk about in our uh really cold iced tea because so far nothing s been going on I mean I do think it s interesting that Victoria Beckham said she s down for a hologram Spice Girls tour but couldn t commit to an on stage so what she s saying is she would go to a sound stage and perform once and then have them hologram it and have people show up for hurt to essentially watch a movie of her doing a performance wow that s a hot take rye I honestly assumed she would show up for a live hologram performance every night I know I m such an idiot I think she s saying I don t she s always been out the door with all these girls who are trying to like make it happen and she s like I m so rich I don t need to go like on tour stop trying to make Spice Girls a thing never gon na happen and it has happened and it is happening and what would happen if she would show up for them I mean it s the poshest thing she could say as Posh Spice I mean of course I don t blame her I m not saying that she needs to like pack her bags and go on tour she has a life like she has kids and she probably like I m sure tour life s lonely I would know I m a recording artist so interesting she like couldn t get far enough away from those girls I feel like yeah sad all right all right daddy said we can t talk about love is blind I just don t watch it but if you have something yeah there was a psychotic thing that had happened okay so there s this guy on the show and I don t know his name is because I don t know any of their names so then if you don t know yeah you know you know I don t know listen so they do testimonials on that show do you know what the show is no A A are in pods they don t see each other they just have conversations through a wall never knowing what each other looks like and they get engaged in a pod without seeing this person and then they meet for the first time there s this one guy in there who s like super monotone Wears Like a three piece suit that s a little bit too tight talks about how like I was on wealth management guy for like ever and then I decided I need to know eventually live my life so I went and started taking pictures of and it s like nobody cares dude and your your A A voice is killing me no one s getting wet listening to that he s like I m a sexually liberated man who likes to make sure that my women come at the same time and sometimes coming for me doesn t mean ejaculation it s like what you re saying I m sure is sexy but the way that you say it like don t care so is the point you hate him yeah everyone everybody should so here s what we get to dude s hella rich and he keeps telling these A A or is he just saying that I mean he s probably just saying it because let me get to the A A climax of the story okay I m ready he asked this woman to marry him I m almost there come on mama get me there come on put me all the way through this is getting me so riled up come on go I m leaving if I don t burst at the end of the story or never talking about love is blind I m gon na throw up Chris he s been like this since you ve stopped coming and I feel like his sexual rage is misplaced my boyfriend s been sick anyway this guy gets down on one knee he s like in his stupid voice he s like I just can t imagine there I used to be more than I can match parents I can t hear you that s the point nobody can hear this A A guy because he s such a droney talker that it s impossible to follow anything he says and the woman goes I know you re rich and I know we can have a good life together because of that and I every five of my being is saying no I can not marry you so he asked for her hand in marriage and she said no one decided to marry a broke year old instead regardless so there s two options yeah two guys proposed to her could you imagine wow what a A A like thank you is she what s she got going on for her I think she has a cute voice I know but like what else like what s her job I couldn t tell you okay so then he goes and the guy that got declined goes into his testimonial where they re like all right so like how did that feel and he goes are we rolling and they go yeah and he goes probably a good time for this then reaches into his two tight pants pulls out a A A ton of eye drops and just squirts them into his eyes a bunch and then he goes yeah I mean I really put myself out there and and it s not clear at first like where his eyes hurt because no no droplets are coming down he goes one second pulls it out again sprays more into the point that they re running down his face and he goes I was just I m crying because my feelings hurt did he really think production was going to be on his side yeah and cut around yeah silly goose I bet he s poor that s why he said that he wants to be a reality star so bad yeah the only reason why I said I bet he s poor is because he was also talking about how rich he is the problem with something like that is for the producers it s so much more entertaining to show the desperation yeah putting in the fake tears yeah that of course they re not just gon na show you crying if like you re pouring tears in your eyes I need to know where he is now maybe he ll start watching this show here s some advice though um authenticity goes a long way there s a reason why I opened this podcast with I have bubble guts and gas you think they re gon na relate yeah I think the girlies are gon na relate yeah should we talk about how disappointed I am in The Watcher yeah I think we already did that no but I hadn t finished it by that time oh spoiler alert A A skip ahead if you don t want me to just ruin your dreams have you seen the Watcher okay we won t talk about let s skip ahead Chris sucks no it doesn t no you had it shouldn t had have more than six episodes I was in it the entire time I enjoyed the entire process I was just dissatisfied with the ending okay you disagree you really got bored or were you got bored storyboarding while watching no I was literally watching it and doing nothing else and I got bored wow yeah I won t ruin it since Chris is here but I do have to say that there uh that Ian Brennan Brenner Brenner which one s that so there s Ryan Murphy and Ian oh his writing partner okay I think Ian is one of the most talented writers in Television right now but you were bored at his show um I don t think that s his fault okay I loved it I thoroughly loved it had it had a better ending top Contender for one of the best shows are you gon na hate me if I need to shut this down for a quick second to go A A my brain s out are you kidding me I m not kidding like low key bubble guts I need to sync my phone to do an advice call anyways you do so I can go crap yeah thank you so much Jesus I m like sweating kidding do you have midle no and there s no uh maybe I ll take some pepper before is it liquid oh I ll vomit it s the consistency for me sickens me all right am I gon na cut half this episode why I don t know I don t think so you ve been blacked out you don t know that I do know that you don t know me how was your moment what moment you just left us it was liberating wow that drink is amazing what did you just drink along you knew what is that it s an energy drink do you want one no show it s four o clock in the afternoon three in L A you don t drink caffeine it was too much we can t every time we start back up I feel like we have a five minute conversation when are we gon na have conversations in real life what are you grabbing for anything seems inappropriate if you wish I have a husband hi guys huge fan love you both um I need some advice so I ve had a friend we ve been friends for over a year and recently she asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding some time went by didn t really hear anything about like dress appointments or like you know what I should do it would be my first time doing so well then one day hit me up asking for help on like you know proposals to all her bridesmaids like what she should uh include and like the gift baskets and stuff I was kind of like that s weird you know to ask me a bridesmaid and I asked her who exactly all of her bridesmaids and I was not listed um quickly found out that I was no longer a breakfast she didn t tell me I was demoted she didn t nothing I feel highly disrespected I don t know if I should or not but I really like an opinion um because I don t really have friends you guys are my friends so um what should I do should I still be your friend should I offer about it I mean it s her decision so I don t I don t know what to do help me thank you I love you guys bye heartbreaking I fired you from being a bridesmaid oh my gosh you did yeah I fired you and Carly but I never wanted to be a bridesmaid I asked this A A if he would be a bridesmaid for me and he said no I mean I didn t say no but like I know that I m not capable of the duties and I you re capable of the duties am I you were at my bachelorette party and my wedding I know but I didn t like plan it that s not what a bridesmaid didn t one of your bridesmaids plan The Bachelor I think they I know Sarah did it s technically the maid of honors duty but no matter what I was gon na plan I planned it myself and then Sarah was like do you want to be surprised I think I was rather for some Antics outside of me you were and that s my point I I had to skinny at my list because of Joe s list and because I was like a boy and whatever like it was no that didn t matter to me oh well then why wasn t I your bridesmaid because I didn t have enough space for you okay and you didn t want to be one okay let s get back to this well no my point being for this girl being quote unquote demoted from being a bridesmaid doesn t mean much I think she took the position very seriously which is very kind of with high regard because it s one of her friends like she was saying I don t have a lot of friends and that s why she was like I want your advice first of all we don t have many friends actually you have a lot of friends I don t have many friends either so I m right there with you um but I do think this meant more to her than it did to me like I wanted to support you on your wedding I was going to be there however you want it yes but I do think there are some people that enjoy that task that want to take it on with high regard and do the the person Justice yes and and I think all of that is true and I think that uh no I do think this wouldn t be advice for you my advice to your friend would be to have a Frank conversation with you where she says I this is why and it s and as long as it s not like some weird personal critique I think the real slap in the face to her was that not only did that not happen she was then requesting her to do a task that was a favor for her bridesmaids which she thought she was one of them she was asked for a suggestion I think it s rude I think it s definitely rude but I don t think it s a deal breaker in a like as like you don t think the friendship is over no I think weddings are psychotic I think people get really crazy but even like for my wedding like I called you and said you re not a bridesmaid and I called Carly you did that you didn t you didn t do that backhanded by asking me to pick up another task in support of the bridesmaid no and that s why I think oh I guess if you re but you got to keep in mind some people get real cuckoo around weddings and she might be nuts about something else that has nothing to do with her friends so what Lizzie s saying is give her the benefit of the doubt and bring it up to her but don t forget you know what I m saying you can forgive me I think you are fully in your rights I don t care how busy this bride is planning her wedding I think it is fully acceptable for you to go to her and be like I will gladly do this for you if that s what you want but my feelings are a bit hurt that I was never told I was demoted from being a bridesmaid and now you re asking me to do something for your bridesmaids and if this is really what s going to make your day special for you I understand but I would just like the wear with all of you to tell me what s going on yeah I think that s like a pivotal pivotal communication point in a relationship like a more serious friendship and I mean I don t know like I ve been in pickles like that with other friends where I feel like they re Duty bound to me to do something or say something to me specifically and I also know that were I to bring up that like am I she were she was asked though I m saying she s Duty bound the bride is Duty bound to tell her no thank you especially after she asked this one yes I m agreeing right okay I m agreeing with you because I think this is A A crazy I know I don t think it s A A crazy but I do agree that there is something owed but I m I m saying weigh the value and the cost of loan sharking that oh you know what I mean is it worth your relationship to bring this up to her right now during her wedding because I can tell you I ve known a lot of A A brides and every single one is unique every single one is stressed out I couldn t A A eat on my wedding day I was A A A A liquid but this is way prior to the way it doesn t it doesn t matter like the pressure is always and this is why I hate weddings this is why I haven t executed my own wedding I don t like that it feels like it s for other people and then you re asking a million people of things for you when it s a lot and that s why I I think this is flat out root I think the bride is in the wrong I think if I were you I would confront the bride I don t care that it s her big day if she had asked me to be a bridesmaid and then not told me I wasn t one I would ask her about it I I just would be a huge red flag for me and if she said oh I m so sorry this is what happened and this is why I would give her the benefit of the doubt and still chug along but it would be like my first red flag from this person so we didn t I m just gon na use an anecdote for my wedding we didn t have invitations we sent out an email and in the email it said to each person like please bring these specific people as your plus one and let them know that they re invited I did not send them their own email you know what I mean yeah and uh somebody was offended that I did did not send them a personal email but told a relative of theirs that the entire family should be included on the invite and they texted me and said I am offended you did not send me a personal invitation during my wedding week I think that s different I think you re in the right I think I know I m in the right well that s what I m I know you are as well but and that person and that person felt like they were in the right by confronting you which you as the bride you re like why are you wasting my time with this you re invited yeah I understand I I personally think this is a different situation I think like a best a bridesmaid is like in your closest Circle of Friends whereas like those are people that are yes invited to your wedding but like get over it you were invited yeah I mean I would say way the opportunity cost of voicing this specific concern and don t forget it and look for another opportunity or find a way to say you know I was I was really looking forward to being a bridesmaid for you because I love you and I took on I I I m seriously I took it very seriously you know that s what I m saying I m just saying I would say something I m not yeah I think what I m saying is if if you do opt to say something make it about you instead of expecting a response from her like and you know what I mean because you can t control her but you can t control you so if you re trying to set about an emotional boundary for yourself speak about your feelings and your wants yeah I I agree with that instead of placing it on her like you re not saying like I need to be a bridesmaid again it s just like I was a little taken back and my feelings are hurt that I wasn t told I m not a bridesmaid but I will gladly help you with this task if that s what you want yeah but I would let it be known like I know it s the bride s day but I I guess I am enough of an A A where I would just be like I want answers no I want to test this with Ryland what do you mean find something that I know you want to do all right starts here that s just a title oh should I read the title no okay my sister does not approve of my husband we just recently got married I ve been with him for seven years and I love him to death the conflict is my sister says a bit too much when she s drunk we got into an argument a few days ago and of course she was under the influence and she made comments about my husband comments like you can do better he s a deadbeat which I don t agree with anything she said he works hard he has full time jobs he s active military and is deploying in January we live with my sister so maybe she feels like it s okay to comment on our living situation and our relationship uh but I I don t have anyone to talk to about this which is why I m reaching out for advice should I tell my husband or keep it to myself so I don t cause issues between both of them help I would not bring it to your husband first I d take it to your sister I would take it to your sister and I would not bring it to your husband because once you do it s it creates such a rift between the two that it may not ever repair I think the biggest would be a massive A A task to repair is it would be an issue for me if my siblings didn t like my significant other but I wouldn t amplify that by living together I know maybe like financially or maybe it makes the most sense for where you re at in life or maybe it s a temporary situation but my my guttural reaction would be to do anything you can to get your sister out of your house because that is your relationship I think they re living in the sister s house they re living in her sister s house oh I didn t know that I thought she just said my sister lives with us we live with my sister we live with my sister ah could go either way um I would get out of your sister s house personally I would have a conversation with your sister I would tell her why this upsets you because it s somebody like not only is it insulting to your husband it s insulting to you because that s who you ve chosen to spend your life with and I would make that known to your sister and be like listen I know you are intoxicated I know also living together bringing more resentment and maybe it s just maybe she doesn t think those things about your husband but that s what she can say to you to get under your skin because she s mad maybe he doesn t do the dishes or take out the trash I just think like when everyone s living in one place a lot of resentment can build with a couple just being a couple a lot of resentment can build there has to be constant communication and that Innova in of itself is a lot of work so I would a have a conversation with your sister and tell her why it bothers you and B you said your husband a full time job I probably you have a job he s active military so but he probably is getting paid yeah so I would get out of that house yeah I also think that if in my experience if somebody has chosen to speak up about not liking a significant other it is because of it s because they love you and they re concerned about something specifically in the relationship that s just my experience yeah so I think approaching it with kindness and love in all things is always the best most positive outcome option because it s like listen dude I know you love me you re my A A sister we live together I know that it must have been really scary for you to bring this up to me and I have to tell you I appreciate that you love me very much and that you re looking out for me but I also need you to know that I am married to this man and this man is my family like and there could be a deeper core issue for the sister too maybe you getting married since it s been recent the sister feels that you two are being pulled further apart even if it s not the truth yeah maybe that s like what the marriage signifies is like we re not as close anymore so I would have a heart to heart with your sister alone and sober yeah and then definitely sober for your relationship even if you move it yeah down the street I don t know I would I would think living apart is healthy I mean there came a point where like my sister lived with Shane and I and it was so much fun we loved it and then there s a time for like your sister to move out because you like and after two independent people you can love each other just the same and you can see each other frequently but it doesn t always have to be together forever yeah yeah and approaching everything with love good luck that s a A A awful place to be between your sister and your husband awful what a A A my stomach would be turning I mean my stomach does turn um do we want another wedding one or do you want the dating two different guys dating two different guys okay the A A oh no we should do roommate wants too much okay yeah that s good hey Lizzy and Ryland love you guys so much sorry that breath I just took and dried the A A out of the back of my throat I need some advice though my roommate and I have been living together for a year now we ve been having dinner together six days a week while I do enjoy this time I want to be more independent and not hurt his feelings by asking to cook just for myself even if he is home he tends to take things very personally while I m willing to eat with him like two times a week how do I go about how do I go about telling him that this lately it feels more like I m dating him than just being his roommate he ever plans he knows what I m having for dinner next Monday I don t know I don t even know what I want for lunch today never mind dinner next week any advice would be great and that s the emails I love this person this is hard I want to have dinner with you six times a week oh yeah are you busy I think this is a hard place to be because especially if I move the A A out of that house I would say that s the healthiest thing to do because A A out of that house a roommate will start I bet you love your roommate I bet I mean listen no I bet you love your roommate I bet your roommate is sweet as A A I find I found in my early s if you re living with somebody that wants more from you then you can give them because you re probably trying to Branch off into your career have a social life of your own as somebody back there no it s the reflection it s the thing sorry I was scared too um I just think the resentment on your roommate s end that wants to be close to you is going to grow and grow and grow and then if you don t get out now you guys will not be civilized yeah are you ordering an Uber I have to order the Uber I m I don t mean to be rude you guys but I have to order the Uber okay um keep going because they re for you no no please keep going I m literally listening to you this is just tapping no I think just that you could try to start setting some healthy boundaries and say listen like sometimes I just want to cook my own thing and do my own thing and I think that s valid and acceptable but I do think over the long term if this person has already cemented this sort of relationship with you I don t think they re going to like love you less or want to be around you less so the only thing you really can do is get out yeah get out wow you re very sternum I m very Stern about it because if you re already feeling scared like you can t tell this person you want to make your own dinner this relationship is codependent and you don t need it I hate to say I agree with you it s awful I know I m giving a tough love situation here with and I m not sugar coating it I think which is way easier to give the benefits of the doubt though you could very much so try and just have a conversation with them before jumping to this ultimatum um totally try for some reason I m just thinking about like Lifetime movies and single white female and I just think you should get out Chris what would you do Chris would stay until he died yeah I don t know I m probably not the right person what would liberated uh Chris do this might be a good therapeutic thing for you to start even practicing a hypothetical saying no to someone it s not even a real notice we literally talked about the surgery today how bad I am at saying no to people in every scenario But but so let s do it with people right now well it s like I don t know I I d love like even just friends like I love people and I have a really hard I know okay I m your roommate I want to have dinner with you seven nights a week I m planning what we re gon na have for dinner a week from now yeah you get into the relationship you re in now and I m upset that like you re not showing up for the dinner that I bought for the two of us to make yeah that s a lot right that s that s I mean for sure move out for sure but see even in that situation I d I d just be like I don t know I d move out without confronting you really I d just move out if you want to you can use this as an opportunity to practice I feel that would cause more damage because then the person would be forever questioning what happened whereas if you just are upfront and honest with people if you re like hey I love you so much I do feel that I need to spread my wings a little bit because I feel like I need I m at this moment in my life where life can take me anywhere and I don t want to feel like I m in a committed relationship with a roommate and that s okay it s okay for you to say no to doing things that make you visceral why are you talking to Chris because he needs to hear it I think my problem is every time I ve ever like I think I just say yes so much that when I finally say no to people they re like wow what a jerk no but he s saying that no I ve had a friend no I understand then you didn t want that friend well no that s not I understand how something like this could evolve because it is like if you re feeling something for months and months and months and you never tell somebody it s boiling on your end forever so by the time you tell them you ve already hit a breaking point but this person has no idea that you ve even started being irritated with them so if you break it on them in month three of your anger it does make them feel a little gaslit like what where is this coming from why is this wrong so I understand and that s like something I m working on too like when somebody upsets me telling them in the moment instead of harboring the feeling and then being like three months from now will you upset me then yeah it s like that person is then like well how was I supposed to A A know I was upsetting you you never told me yeah like maybe this roommate it would be like I d be fine doing dinner two nights a week but like I feel like you ve been harboring this for months yeah but for the record I think you re both totally right and like they have to talk and they have to tell them and they re like yes they re both completely they don t want to practice right now on a hypothetical standing your ground it could be groundbreaking for you what should I say I don t know what are you doing thank you so much Chris is the person saying no I m the roommate Chris do you want to have dinner with me six nights a week oh God and then right let s start let s have dinner six nights a week yes please no I appreciate uh what you re saying and I love having dinner with you but I think six days might uh be a lot for me to commit to but Chris I already got us your favorite chicken tacos for the next Tuesday and the following Tuesday I see I m just gon na cave in I m gon na stop it we re never gon na ask you to eat tacos with us on a Wednesday okay we ve got to go no we ve got time this Uber is never coming well I can t be a tripod like this for an hour oh his arms are tired come on Chris yeah I mean but the one the one day would be okay though that s the problem that s how my brain works no and that s okay if you re if are you okay with one day yeah what are you looking forward to one day yeah I m looking forward to having dinner with you one day a week thank you so much for asking I m looking forward to it my problem with that scenario though is then the then you feel like you have to be out of the house or it s dinner time with the the roommate that s a you thing I don t because he was like I don t really feel like I can make my own dinner right no it s an all of us thing but it s like you need to retrain your brain to be comfortable with that because it s not weird it s not weird for you to make yourself dinner in your own home and eat it by yourself quietly you go to work all A A day you have to wear a A A mask in public if you want to eat breakfast lunch or dinner in your A A bedroom for yourself that s fine yeah I guess you could just take that approach of also just being stern and standing your ground it s not even about being stern it s about being stern with yourself like what I m doing is okay duck word as A A and that s what I m saying that s what you have the that s what you have the power to change and get the A A out of that house I don t know there is a such a thing as somebody sucking the energy out of the room like yeah that s what get out of the room but but we open with leave the A A roommate that s crazy all right and second of all if you re a person who has a hard time standing your ground use this as an opportunity to practice standing your ground and get the A A out of that house all right because that s cuckoo nuts okay well we ve gone on for a long time I hope you enjoyed today s episode this is like an hour and minutes let s not take two that s what this is only take two no you d went A A yeah uh this is three oh yes you re right wow look at us gifting the podians oh my gosh giving the gift of time giving the gift of time it was a slow start Speedy midsection no the midsection was the worst Marines up at the end Hot

another episode of the Sip I m Riley Adams of course joined by Elizabeth I m okay your little fishy sisters yours official relentus Halloween is official officially um officially set yeah and here we are we re diving into the depths of Halloween if you re not watching the today s podcast on YouTube you have to watch today s podcast on YouTube because Lizzy put her Blood Sweat and Tears into creating the look that you re seeing and honestly I feel like it s Couture it is it s high fashion it s avant garde it is I feel like something we could Rock the Met Gala absolutely it s giving I just had my wisdom teeth out but can still look Posh but hell up like disco disco head injury yeah and so we re fish you know I think you re just Reinventing the will this outfit is so inventive when you first told me your vision for this because I know I guess in the comments people had discovered we well they heard me whisper crevice which I didn t and I edited the podcast and I had no idea I would have muted us yeah I m glad everyone could have some fun um delving into what we were going to become yeah because of time restraints well I wanted to be Travis and I wanted you to be Courtney and yeah I said then you have to put a bald cap on and you have to get tattooed tattoos on the head but I come in and I fly out the same day so I would look real crazy at the airport looking grab this look on because sometimes I get straight up off this couch and go right back to the airport so we needed something that we could put on and take off really fast I want to detour from your costume for just a second because when you re talking about going to the airport from our house last time you were at the airport in full Glam yeah looking like you just walked a runway show yeah Lizzy texted me and she goes I m too pretty to be at the airport I will also never wear that much makeup to the airport again and explain what went down it was just all the attention in the world it was just mortified isn t that everything isn t that what you want no I mean that not like some guy was like what the TSA guy of all people was like where are you going you look like you re going to a party and I was like I m going home sir I ve had a long day look and then I went and sat down at the gate and this guy sits down next to me and he just feels like he should start talking to me and it s just like no you should have like hitting on you I don t know what he was doing it was like remember I had sent you that uh overheard La about the influencer who was sitting in a middle seat and Coach it s so good I was sitting in a middle seat and coach and this guy comes up and he s like so like what do you do and I was like I m a journalist I m an accountant the furthest thing from journalists we have a podcast culture and we don t we break the news here we make up the news here yes we do we re like we saw a half of a headline didn t click it and let us tell you all about it had a real big reaction hmm and so when Lizzy told me she was gon na create fish heads I was like oh this is one of her Lizzy things but because I didn t want to execute something more elaborate I said whatever you want and then she had sent me an architectural drawing of what it was going to be like I didn t know it was so structurally planned out well technically by the city it was not approved by the city I had no building permits so like let s keep this offline but I didn t have a plan going into it I just knew that it was going to be a baseball cap backwards and the bill was going to be the fin but everything else I just sort of like dumb bitched like I just put a hat on top of the fabric and then I m sorry I m swimming I get it I get it does it look like we re swimming my concern was I said well one of us needs to be able to have headphones on because we have to know if we re recording yeah and she was like don t worry I ll work that into my design and she really did and I said well is the back gon na get lost and I was like no because when I talk I look at you so now you ll get to see us swimming throughout the entire they re so good and stupid I might wear these to work on Halloween can I ask you how much these cost oh yeah but it s because I didn t have a plan I over bought material so I could literally make an entire school of fish right now but I m out of hats I can give you some hats I don t know if I could ever I don t know if I could make more my house is covered in glitter but I bought like too much fabric just whipping out the steam cleaner cleaner he better be um yeah no I mean technically these were two hundred dollars but it s because I bought so much material like I bought four yards of their body material and I barely used a yard on both their bodies well you know what maybe you should design like a dress or something because these are beautiful oh yeah no I was trying to I think I might like add them to some dresses I have right now like as a fringe thing I don t know I like all of it I also want to make something out of the body material because it just it s like bathing suit stuff so fun and she brought us Steve Jobs turtlenecks to rock with them we each took a Halloween theme like so the next episode is going to be titties mine right but you don t know what it is no I ll all I know is that Rylan has fake titties and I have fake titties because which I saw who doesn t I guess maybe I m going too hard with the fake titties because I was getting some like semi aggressive messages that I was like being exploitative to women what how I m like so frequently wearing the titties and I don t feel exploited by you wearing I m like titties I m paying homage to the female figure which I love yeah I m confused by that quite frankly well he might be exploiting a woman right now in me waiting women by titties I mean I m sure hers was a little bit more elaborate I don t have I should have screenshotted it so I could have addressed the beef here yeah because I m confused well I don t know if you re offended by me dressing however I want to just have a good day wow I don t know it sounds like you just need to keep swimming my guy since I could just need to keep going yeah um okay so what s been going on hold on I m trying to make it so I can see you well I put I like attach them oh yes daddy so then that one yes oh good for me good for you wow that s nice wow did you not put anything down for the top of the show has nothing been going on in your life oh so much has been going on in my life oh your notes are broken this is the other thing yeah I ve been your like podcast assistant because we both pull our way in like what we re gon na talk about but Lizzy s brand new phone not a but like months old phone is down and out it won t work somebody tried to explain to us how to get your notes but you guys have to realize if you re gon na explain something to us you have to do it like step by step as if it s for like a really stupid person because I am a really stupid person and if it s not really clearly spelled out I can not actually do it um but what have I been up to I ve been directing I m getting ready to do my commercial and so you re in casting for your commercial right now I m in casting for my commercial right now and it s so cute because there s three little girls in it uh oh a baby a ten year old and a year old who are all portraying the same woman yeah that s just different stages of her life but seeing all these little girls audition tapes is like A A me up like I don t know how to explain it but I m like I m proud of every one of them I don t know a single soul but they are so cute I m proud of everyone that you re like cheering them I m like yeah I m sitting at home it s like well I guess I have to write a movie about a bunch of little girls so that I can give the ball a roll in something because they re so cute some of them are like hi I m Ashley like they re just so bold and it s like wow I wish I had that kind of like confidence ever in my life they re so cute they re killing me and if you don t know what we re talking about Lizzy is directing a spec commercial so that she can get more uh jobs directing other people s commercials yes because it s a great gig it s like it s a really good you get to flex a creative muscle while making a good paycheck and doing something in a step of the direction that you love and if you work in production you know that more often than not a commercial set is going to be one of the most comfortable sets because the client is always there and the client is the product that you re selling and all of the commercial world is about pleasing the client so there s going to be great food there s gon na be really solid catering it s gon na be like very chill and it s a couple of days shoe it s always yeah it s between like three to five days shoot so it s like probably a two week job Max so I don t know I m into it it s a dream we re gon na get there yeah and I think I mean have you given your spec commercial idea on the podcast or is that like being withheld for now oh no it s I didn t give it on the podcast but I talked about it on my vlog and it s uh it s the last thing you d expect from me but it s uh basketball shoes but isn t it a story of your life yes inspired by did you take the the sentiment and transport it to basketball because yeah it s always a basketball player and that s why it s funny so my dad s a basketball player my dad loves basketball do I have a booger in my nose I keep telling something I m so itchy too like I wonder if it s just hot glue that s tangling off of our house because my nose is so itchy if we re bugging out I m sorry I was at a party last night and I was like I went to a party yeah I was like I know there s a booger in my nose right now what s going on there s my friend Kylie just got a house in Toluca Lake and it s A A stunning and she had a housewarming party that was catered with like an endless Brazilian food buffet wow she s like yeah just keep eating they re just gon na refill everything you just keep eating and I was like what the A A A A I blacked out on food last night too so keep going uh we ll go back to it I knew no one at the party so I was like alone there for the longest time and I thought like I could go and sit next to this guy and talk to him because he s like oh he looks gay like this is probably okay he looks gay and then I was like Hey like how do you know them he s like I don t and I was like oh he s like that s my girlfriend I was like okay and then she couldn t she came and just stood with her back to me and I was like all right um and then I like saw one person I knew and I was like never leave me um did your husband not go with you no he didn t go with me because I was coming from Glendale and it was in Toluca Lake and we re in Sherman Oaks yeah I know oh let me dive into my food and then we ll get back to your commercial last night we had a friend over um spooky season cannibal style cooked them up you never would you never know what s going on in someone s basement quite honestly after you watch them no I m just saying like there could be you could think of more your neighbor s perfectly normal and you don t know what s going on I want to show you what my grandma keeps in her fruit Cellar you can check my basement though like mine yeah nice A A try you creep I have a spooky season story but I ll get there in a second we re getting so derailed um okay so we had a friend come over and um we haven t found like a good Mexican restaurant around because it s Colorado yeah it s like too far away from anything like delicious Mexican food wise yeah and uh so we tried a new place we ordered the entire menu the shame was like we probably need dessert too right and so we got two dozen Krispy Kreme for like one friend that came over yeah to see us and uh yeah so I just like um so good I want to do that with you sometime I want to go somewhere and get everything on the menu oh we ve never done that and now that you Vlog that s like it s the best it s the best excuse to work should I just call out a sec from work tomorrow and stay the night I brought nothing this is the one time I brought nothing on a trip didn t even bring my laptop and then I get on the plane they re like we re gon na be stuck on the tarmac for an hour and a half the one time I bring nothing of course not even a book like you re a reader you know I m a reader what are you reading I m reading the hour of the witch by the guy who wrote the book the flight attendant that the show is based off of oh I never finished Oh I thought somebody was behind me but it was just in my peripheral my costume I am spooked out right now so let s get back to your commercial and I ll give you my spooky story so I was telling you the inspiration for it basketball my dad s from Indiana and Indiana s a huge basketball state Hoosiers whatever I don t A A know because I m not a basketball gal yeah and then he moved out to San Francisco and had me but when I was a little girl he would take me to the basketball courts with him and tie hot pink basketball shoes on my baby feet it s very cute and he would say Stanford women s basketball scholarship like influencing me as a baby to like aim for that yeah manifesting it never played basketball not a day of my A A life couldn t even tell you um but that has always stuck with me and I ve never had an idea for a commercial but when my friend was like you should start I was like yeah I should start you re right sorry there s just glue all over my A A face I m also scared of is I need to check that we re still recording we are it s fine everything s good God bless new phone so like my controller I m like oh you got a new phone uh the day it came out it was announced I like I was looking at the features that it has and I couldn t help but hit order so it finally came oh interesting yeah do you need my old one maybe okay we ll talk about that yeah let s talk about that after actually because this is crazy we ve derailed your commercial concept so then the idea is a dad a tired dad pushes his baby in a stroller to the basketball courts in the morning ties this Negron says women s uh basketball scholarship and then starts playing and then uh you think he s gon na take a shot but he passes the ball and all of a sudden it s years in the future and he s on the court with his year old daughter and they re doing drills playing one on one and together they re saying Stanford women s basketball scholarship Stanford wins basketball scholarship and then she shoots and he s so proud of her and then she says dad and he s she it s seven years in the future now she s years old she s walking onto the basketball courts holding an acceptance letter from Stanford that is so cute and she goes Stanford women s basketball scholarship and he goes Steph and it sounds just like that and then at the end it s a product shot of the shoes uh with the dad holding his daughter wow and it says remember where you started maybe they ll buy this concept from you whoever I doubt it I doubt it Nike should come call I mean I don t think he s gon na A A spring on a six thousand dollar spot but like well I m just is that who you re going to have the mock company be yeah I mean it s Nike has is such a big brand that it s really easy for me to get baby shoes girl shoes teenager shoes and Dad shoes that are all in unison and they have such a wide range of like because even though it s a spec commercial I want it to look like a full ass commercial so I want them to be like all on brand and all of it s part of it I feel like your sound design is crucial to making me cry yes I have a really cool guy working on the sound design for me he s doing a kind of like a score because I think the rhythm of it is to the beat of the basketball and the and the rhythm of the Mantra of Stanford women s basketball scholarship and uh I also hear my dad s song My mine and my dad s song is I love you baby the Macy Gray one but I could also hear like little beats of uh little hints of something that s inspired by that I love you love you baby okay don t copyright the podcast because it s so good yeah you know maybe my problem with your singing is not your singing voice it s the copyright volume oh no it s the volume because you liked it when it was soft yeah I was fine you wanted me to hold you a little bit when you re screaming it s where it s like some requirements some requires screaming little abrasive a little abrasive okay well I hope you will share it on the like I hope we can roll it on the podcast we definitely can we definitely can because I m not going to use anything that s copywritten okay yeah great yeah wow I can t wait and the really exciting thing was yesterday I met with I usually do my own storyboards but they re they don t really trans do you know what a storyboard is so do you really yes okay draw out okay but it was like the setup well no it was up because it felt like one of those moments where you re like of course you have to read the script in one setting stupid because I don t know I just wanted you to know they re my own insecurities let me go through it myself work through it baby I love how the lights reflect the sequence onto the face God it s good so I met with do you know who McGee is no MCG is a director he did Terminator Charlie s Angels like the Drew Barrymore okay uh he s done a A A to the movies he also did the babysitter on Netflix which I love and the babysitter too which I also love okay but his storyboard artist is a friend of mine so I sat with him yesterday and he did my storyboards for the commercial all I m swimming I m sorry I m I m vibing I m just I m fine with you so big but every time you get scared I get scared that does not work for me but anyways the boards are really cute okay well okay I ll send you pictures of them when I can send pictures again I know that s the other annoying thing along with the Lost notes she can t send or receive pictures so I ve been sending her pictures all day long she s like I can t open them and I m like when can we well I was like send it to me on Instagram he goes are you on Snapchat and it s like stop plugging your A A Snapchat no I wasn t I have a hard rule that I don t open Instagram until afternoon it has to be p m or The Only Exception is Thursdays when I promote the podcast or Wednesdays when I promote the podcast and even then I can t see anything I just have to post yeah and get out it s a hard rule for myself good for you yeah it goes along with my like setting up my morning right you know your morning right yeah like I need to meditate oh setting your morning right I thought you meant like right like a like a in a different way no yeah no no no no no I was like damn that s like pretty intensive like a right like what is it okay so uh yesterday I was just in my office like doing my own thing editing my Vlog I go started sucking your dick well that would be more interesting that like I have so many questions does it start while I m soft and get the ghost gets me hard or like it depends on how often started my desk you could be knowing you interesting concept maybe you should work something out there um I don t know like one of your shorts next commercial next spec commercial yeah for honey next discount use concept he s got the Sip well I don t know if it s sip or the Sip so I don t know dude codes are hard codes are hard I didn t realize how hard coats are until I had to do my own code oh Lizzy got her first sponsor I got my first sponsor her I m so proud of you thank you oh I don t I might I don t even know if I m allowed to talk about it that s why I m being weird no like I don t know if I m allowed to talk about it why wouldn t you be able to talk about it I mean they did approve the video because the thing that you sign says don t talk about this no we did do a contract yes okay I was gon na ask you that because I I was like help we were going all the way through to you getting like your final approval but I didn t ask you about agreements oh yeah they sent me an agreement I don t do anything without a contract and did you contact a lawyer no but it was very standard yeah okay as long as you understand it was short and clear a lot of times they ll send like a page thing this was not that okay yeah this is very short it s one video right well yeah yeah okay yeah but it was very clear like don t talk about it until we approve it but they approved it this morning oh until they okay yeah all right but I A A up the code multiple times so now one of the codes in the video it just cuts to Black it s just a voiceover Lizzy you could use b roll and just do a voiceover oh like b roll of the bedding no it s too late for that video s been approved it then there s no issue here uh go watch Lizzie s Vlog and support her brand deal especially if you need the product she s plugging which it s a A A great product I was actually thinking about they sent you it yeah should I just say what it is yeah why not I got bed sheets from Brooklyn and they re A A awesome I wish they d come over to the park come on over guys the water is fine seems okay what happened at your desk oh so I m sitting I m working all of a sudden so all of our TVs are on Apple TVs yeah and so um like you can airPlay from your phone and sometimes I ll like poke at Shane because I ll know that he s awake before he comes out of the bedroom like if he s Snapchatting or replying to emails like he ll like sometimes depending on his workload if he s like doing emails from his phone he ll be up for an hour before he actually comes out right so sometimes if I like know he s awake or if he s like replying to an email that I m cc d on I ll run in the bedroom and be like I got you you re awake I still want to run in there and screaming I got you with our little fish heads on just snuggle up in bed next to him and so the TV downstairs starts blaring at full volume while Shane s asleep I m in my office and it goes from One Clip and then it stops the clip playing but then by default whatever was previously playing on YouTube starts playing it s scaring me what you re saying I ran down and like turned off the TV and I was like oh Shane had airplayed and so I m like let me go get this A A so I run into the bedroom I m like gotcha A A and he s like conked my eyes are watering I m so asleep that it haunted me I like ran around the kitchen three times being like what and why did you run around the kitchen three times because I was like making sure nobody was in the house oh just in the kitchen well no like I run around the island three times clear the house no one s in it no that s the kitchen to that living room there s like a circle okay okay around the kitchen look in the entryway around the kitchen down the step because there s like multiple yeah I thought you just meant you were in the kitchen running in a circle no I m checking my roundings and then nothing so Shane finally wakes up and I m like what went on yeah and he s like the dogs just sat on the remote and I was like yeah that sounds like a good A A Theory my dogs do that all the time TBH but I looked and the remotes were up on like the the TV console because like sometimes Riley s still a puppy she hasn t been like chewing Furniture but I ll like put it up on the thing it was like up on the thing yeah Nikki started just jumping up onto the coffee table which is wild and it s so funny we don t stop him which is probably bad that dog s out of control Sarah came over the other day and she goes oh so you guys haven t started teaching in boundaries yet Sarah you ve been to my house so many times you have to know we don t teach boundaries here and I m trying real hard to teach my puppy boundaries and I would say that me and my puppy got very far together yeah but now like three consecutive days in a row people have come over and when people come over it s like everything she s ever learned goes out the window you got ta take her out in public a bunch no but you just got to take her to the list of my mom s house and I take like you know but it s just because she s so she s a puppy so she s so excited to see somebody that she doesn t know or see frequently so it s like she s just you know when you walk in the store it s like the world had ended and she s like a floppy bounce just like maybe a queef also I m on queef talk now what yeah did you know this is a thing like year four you page is girls queefing I ve seen a couple of queef Pages now I ve seen at least three queefing things on Tick Tock is it like face shots with the audio of the girls one of them actually had me dying of laughter but it s because the comment section was so funny it s a girl who I guess her username is like queef girl or something so her thing is queefing but she wanted she s like she s literally wearing a full ass like Spider Man outfit like for Halloween she s like I was just trying to post a Spider Man thirst trap but everybody s like queef A A she s like okay what do you want from me and so she starts going like this with her like she starts queefing but making it the sounds of Spider Man so she s like like that can you just queef on command I guess you can I guess like I you know me I don t know how vaginas work it s just about sucking Aaron the right way and forcing it out like how I force you can force queef I believe so it s happened accidentally to me like as a child and I ll be like the A A are you ever in a workout class and accidentally quit that s never happened to me thank Jesus Christ because it s also like you get to it happens to you once and you re like well I m never doing that again you know what I mean because it s mortifying and then Tick Tock I don t know and then embarrassments into Fame well so many there was another one I saw where this girl s just like at a restaurant and she s wearing a skirt and she comes over and she goes are they adding these in posts it seems like they are but honestly I don t think so and I know that I fall for tick tock every day and I m constantly sending you fake news from Tick Tock what fake news did you send me the other day and I was like Lizzy I highly highly doubt it I highly doubt it and then I Googled it and I was like nothing Leah Michelle was fired from lying about getting covered yeah I bought that I sent that to like five people it was like Leah Michelle said she got coveted to go to LA to audition for a call or producer session and Lizzie s like oh my gosh she was five and I googled it I was like Lizzy just another day in Tick Tock lands pray for me wow you really can make up anything you want on Tick Tock yes you can I think these Cliffs are real they re very funny I wish I could pull up the comment section from the Spiderman queef thing because people are very funny on Tick Tock oh what was this Emoji Fiasco I had seen multiple people talking about it but I didn t see like the actual sound bite of the story and then I forgot to click on the article again today oh I have no idea what you re talking about you put it in the document about how thumbs up emojis and stuff come on Lizzy you can oh no the thumbs up emoji is the equivalent to a period at the end of a text I guess that s a lie okay that s a full blown lie I need to see the logic can you no I can t I had to oh why didn t you add it to the dog I did the links right here on my paper that I can t click and I really did mean to look at it oh is it ever appropriate to use the thumbs up emoji gen Z says no oh I wanted to do this with you because it s the symbols only old people use that have gen Z rolling their eyes and I use the thumbs up in my everyday life gen Z sees the thumbs up emoji as rude or passive aggressive okay and how do they feel about periods are they like they don t like periods you know that oh so they re with me wow they don t like these they don t like the thumbs up they don t like the okay they don t like to see no evil they don t like the crying they don t like the kiss they don t like the red heart what s wrong with the heart I don t know there s something wrong with Gen Z though like y all need to find something to do this time go twiddle your thumbs elsewhere guys and we can t say everyone also I don t know if this is the person we want championing championing says it s important to understand the Dynamics of your workplace before sending these emojis especially the thumbs up you re kidding me it s bad form especially at work where it can make the team appear unfriendly and unaccommodating I feel like a thumbs up emoji is very accommodating I feel like it s passive aggressive I feel about the thumbs up how you feel about the um period at the end there s no way it s like confirming right but it s like it s to me it feels like being like sure okay so it s like what do you mean sure A A it took you more time to save it took you more time to say sure than yeah you know what I mean and sure hurts so just say yeah you know what I mean yeah you know what I mean okay whatever I m with Gen Z on this one for the first time I m so excited to partner with Native on today s

gay baited or something I mean I think she s always been a gay baiter like do you work what that time it was a dog it wasn t just like it s the way that your eyes travel it s like you re looking at someone and then their soul leaves their body and they just slow it s like what they do in horror movies in a super close up when something really A A up is behind them and that s like don t do that to me I can t go out in a fish head now I m freaked out in this house you have to understand why because ghost be sucking your dick left and right yeah but but here s the deal Madonna s been kissing people on stage for like ever like girls whatever oh yeah Brittany and Christina but scandalous the whole thing for me that it s so like a it s just like I don t know it just seems a little odd to me I don t know I think she s getting the same high that everyone is that gets a viral Tick Tock and I think she s probably just trying to continue on getting the attention on Tick Tock that people are talking about I feel like a pop star is probably somebody who thrives on attention yeah and when you find a new found form of attention in in Tick Tock right it s like if the more jaw dropping things I do the more I m talked about the better I mean what does she have to lose and when you re right when you reach a status point of Madonna where you have the money you have the fame it s like even if the Press is negative it s like okay what s it to her yeah I guess that s a good point I don t know I always think of people like my like Madonna s on a pedestal to me so I always think of her as someone who should keep herself sort of like Elusive and exclusive okay like I don t know don t don t give it all up on Tick Tock because like what the A A is Tick Tock in comparison to Madonna you know what I m saying well I agree but I think that s the problem with Tick Tock right in general I think everyone s succumbing to bearing all yeah you know it s like let me exploit the the deepest of myself for views that is what it is and even when I was like trying to dabble in again I m just like ah yeah you know it s just like am I really doing I mean I ve had I have fun doing it every tick tock I ve done is fun but it s like I m not maintaining a day to day upload schedule on Tick Tock because to me it s dark I just it s a lot did you see I m on be real well okay I so do you know what that is yes because like people out and about will be like can we be real and the first time I was like what do you mean like yeah we can be real let s be real and no they re like no it s like it s like a photo and I was like oh okay and then after like a couple of times I was like okay let s be real who did this to you like people out and about like anybody on the street will stop and say will you be in my be real no like people that like have seen the Vlogs With podcasts or love Shane right right yeah they ll stop us and instead of like a regular photo they ll ask to be real well that s crazy because that means it has to be their time to be real wow because you don t get to pick when you post they say now s your time to be real and I guess I I looked into it a little bit but I guess why it hasn t caught on for like influencers or YouTubers is because your friend capacity maxes out at a thousand well I mean I personally like it because there is no choreographing some A A like you just go into the app you have to take a picture of what of like you can take a picture of something you re looking at but it also does a reverse side of it too so if I took a picture a selfie right now you d be the other side of the selfie yeah no I ve I yeah I ve now come to see what it is I like it I love it I just think it s interesting that they are trying to take away um the virality of what it could potentially become by capping your your friends at a thousand so I think they re gon na open it up like they re probably gon na open it up at some point just they re gon na have to if they want to grow it into something huge and I didn t realize that it was like that when I signed up for it because my friend Mal was just like get on be real and I was like what the A A is be real like I m always real A A I can t A A filter this A A um but yeah maybe Madonna should get on be real that s all I m trying to say well I mean only a thousand of us would have the pleasure of seeing her be real and that s exclusive and Elusive that is exclusive and that s on brand for her I don t know maybe we ll be real today they caught the Stockton serial killer this morning so I don t know about this case really no there s been a serial killer plaguing Stockton can I just say I have a funny story about it okay well can you enlighten me first I was just thinking about the Dahmer thing because a lot of people were mad that the show was made but I was like there s all these True Crime podcasts yeah how s that any different it s not and people are upset about True Crime podcasts too are they though yeah okay um so there was a serial killer in Stockton that was shooting people and clearly just doing it for killing they weren t taking any IDs they weren t or they weren t taking any cars money valuables nothing they were just shooting people and walking away and it was crazy and nobody knew what was going on there was a huge uh you know reward for any information and then at multiple crime scenes uh security camera footage caught someone who looked like the same person leaving each crime scene and uh they were using a gun and ballistics showed that all of these killings were connected um and they were also connected to a couple other killings in like where there was uh one reason yes this is today like this morning at like like but the killings were also recent yes oh my God yeah so my mom lives up in that area and my mom s always texting me I m so sorry Mom I will text you back more frequently but my mom s always texting me and it s always a lot and it s always a little incoherent I don t know maybe you can t see the text screen I don t know she s talk to texting things get jumbled it s so jumbled though that I m like I don t know what this A A is saying ever and like sometimes she s sending pictures and I don t have it in me to explain like I don t get pictures right now so I just go oh crazy like cute nice like I m just always sending some dumb A A thing and so I was out the other day my mom s texting me and I just like was going with one of my A A I was like oh nice look at you and then I read the full text message and she s like we have a serial killer in our neighborhood my response was oh nice because I wasn t reading it is so bad and then my mom responded are you being funny that was when I read it and I was like no I m just ignoring you like like your phone my phone really doesn t work Mom I m just lightly ignoring you because I m busy as A A right well your story checks out because even at the beginning of the podcast I was talking about how annoying it is that I can t send you pictures yeah I know but like yeah so but they caught him they caught him this morning so they re okay off the security camera footage they uh a few people called in with leads and then they started trailing this one guy and then this morning he was he got into his car with his weapon and the while they were trailing him they noticed that he was like slowing down and stopping at dark parks and they fully caught him on the hunt thank God yeah it really does scare me I mean especially going into like workout classes like group workout classes or movie theaters it never doesn t cross my mind and it just is like it sucks that that s the place that we re at I mean yeah yeah uh yeah it s crazy there s it seems like there s been a steady decline in like straight up serial killers but then like a like a surge of mass shootings which I mean I don t know like I know that they re they re technically different things but like both are pretty A A up and scary and if if all of it s I don t know guys but yeah he s off the streets wow Jamie Lee Curtis press store is really something I have you so like do you watch any of those movies I don t I have never seen that you ve never seen them you ve ever seen the Halloween so I have seen the Halloween movies I haven t seen the most recent one but it is getting horrible reviews yeah have you seen it no no um no I ll see it what I have seen is like of her press junket circuits yeah and she is just I know how you feel about her herself I love her and support her with every fiber literally on all of these talk shows being like I hate horror I hate the genre I would never go to a horror movie and the interviewers are like but you re promoting a horror movie she s like yeah I don t get all of you like I m grateful it made my career but I would never I don t get what you sicko is like and it just kills me I love her but she s like what she doesn t care and then she s like she s just such an actress yeah because they re talking about like her film yeah to this last time and she s like I made the ending I told the director it should end and she starts going through the process of how she saw the ending end in like the visual storyboard of it and she s like bawling at her own storyboarding wow for the ending of the movie I identified I was like are you like are you in character right now or like why why is your story moving you to this but really just but put it into put it into like perspective you re years old you re in a movie where you re the lead you re the final girl and then you re A A years old and you made a you ve made a movie for this same role at least once every you know to years that s that s cathartic and now it s over and she s gon na die do you know what I m saying yeah we re all gon na die in real life we re all gon na die she s a little closer to death than you and I hopefully hopefully yeah you never know what tomorrow brings so bring your loved ones close no I didn t say that you did I know I m kicking it just fine no I love her I m just saying like think about that that s A A crazy if you what you re something years old I don t know how old she is I m not saying that any of her feelings are not valid yeah what I m saying is the way that she presents and holds herself in these junkets I mean and honestly is very entertaining yeah it has me watching the entire press towards I love her I will I will stand by myself I m not saying very fascinating to watch in interviews because she ll be like all the way up here and then she s crying and then she s talking about how she hates the genre and she s like this movie s so great but I would never see it and I m like so you re asking people to see your movie but you re saying you hate the job well the problem is the movie sucks well have they all sucked I don t know um people were super disappointed in the last one And even Chris was disappointed in this one I saw his Instagram Chris s Instagram story was so dramatic if you don t want to hear anything nasty about Halloween then just skip my next slide I mean A A sucked that s pretty nice right to tell people it s yeah it s a warning yeah something we didn t I tried last time we were talking about TV yeah I ruined don t worry darling but I gave a proper spoiler alert and then we were talking about like the fun movie to watch from home the fall I didn t call it if I remember to watch from home I did yeah everybody was super disappointed in me giving away the obvious sorry guys no it wasn t the obvious don t do it again in case they haven t seen that episode whatever they throw their shoes away okay it s it s the hot glue for me oh who the A A is Hugh Jackman and why is Lizzy sending me tick tocks asking if he s gay how do you not know who Hugh Jackman is is he a Notting Hill no but Julia Roberts no oh then I don t know that s is he a rom com man no then I need you to look directly at a camera when you ask release some really honest questions like that about Hugh Jackman he s Wolverine oh see no he s Mr he s that guy in the greatest show I ve never seen you know the musical it s a show about a show about a musical I m just like for how excited I got with about funny girl with all the Press unlike I ve seen it couldn t tell you a A A thing about it and all of the people saying like the performance of a lifetime she brings the world to what like I was just like so hyped up on everyone s analogy for funny girl yeah I then watched her like do a song from it on one of the night shows and I like couldn t get through it to save my life so here can I have can I say something nasty I mean if it s detached for me it s detached for me okay I have seen a lot of Leah Michelle s press on funny girl and I ve seen like people are like filming her in the theater which I think is A A up don t do that that s incredibly rude don t A A do that put your phone away enjoy the moment don t do it anyways I think she s a little Dead behind the eyes it seems like a soulless performance like she s kind of phoning it in and like yeah her voice is throwing it in a little bit wow because it s like yeah her voice is there but that s an effortless thing for Leah Michelle I don t know and then well I mean like I m watching her like do the blocking and she s like I m over here right now and I m over there right now and now I m here and this is a choice I made three years ago and I m gon na do it now too like I can t right I mean you re entitled to your opinion I don t like that my opinion was essentially the same in the I tried watching her two routines from the show and I was like oh it s a routine not like a musical theater person I like a real passionate spontaneous moment because for me like it s all like that s why I wish I could sing so bad because that to me is like the deepest most Soulful expression of emotion and I and that s why I love musicals it s not doing it for me okay so I forgot that s another Tick Tock lie that Hugh Jackman s gay or no I think he s a little gay I think he s gay no but people have been talking about it for years like is Hugh Jackman gay it was like a clip I tried watching it and I was like I just don t know this man enough to like watch this whole Tick Tock because sometimes you send me like minute long tick tocks and I m just like trying to clean my barn no it was a tick tock I know but he was on stage dude oh my god he has a wife oh this is bad for you wow yeah but I ve always thought he was gay I mean I ve always thought a lot of people were gay I don t know Hugh Jackman s wife pokes fun at rumors he s gay wow well wasn t it based upon him being on stage talking about like I m gay yeah that s well he used to he s a man who s very comfortable in a sexuality but like I I it doesn t matter whether or not he s gay but it s like everybody s always been like Hugh Jackman it s gay yeah yeah well a lot of men I was mostly devastated by the fact that you re like who s Hugh Jackman but then I remembered who I was talking to and I was a little bit less don t come at me too like when I didn t know Florence Pew and called her nipples and I still and now I love her I saw her don t worry darling the only reason to see the movie come on Florence come on Florence come on miss it the A A are you Sarah Michelle Geller s kids are not allowed on social media I believe kids need to know oh that s her quote Yeah do you want me to do the quote Yeah she says I believe kids need to know what their limitations are and they actually thrive in that environment we re not mean we re not necessarily strict but we have rules and why did you put this in the document I think it s incredibly important that people comprehend that if you put it on the A A internet it lives forever and kids these days are put on the internet at the point of inception your pee stick that says positive pregnancy test is on the A A internet more often than not now people know your birthday they know everything about you you re beginning middle and last name like your beginning name you re like they know everything about you they know your birthday they know your birth weight they know what hospital you were born at they know how proud your mommy and daddy are to be your A A parents and that you ve completed their lives like it s too much I think it s too much and kids are given social media at such a young age that they don t understand that everything they re posting is going to be there forever and Sarah Michelle talks about the importance of them understanding that more so than something living forever I think because I m so hyper aware of like what you put out like I have nightmares about the podcast still the night before it goes up like did I go through and did I say something that s gon na offend somebody and did I like so that is less of my concern more of my concern is exposing people to more than they can actually physically hand up handle yes because we re like human beings aren t meant to have access to the entire world like I don t think we re mentally able to comprehend what that means to have everyone be able to weigh in it s like on your weight your looks your thoughts your opinions everything I feel like you re the people that you interact with should be that for a while because why would I want to introduce my children to million people develop uh problems that they like outside of their real life you know what I m talking about because comments a comment can stick with you forever and so why give them more opportunities to have more hurtful comments yeah it s like Khloe Kardashian said it s just noise I love where she has gotten in a sense of I think she s dealt with so many traumatic things that yeah when Kim is actually going through it s interesting to see like the Kim being affected for once being like Oh I m so like torn down right now between Kanye and her comment on variety I do like that she didn t back down I like that she was like I meant the messaging how the messaging came across maybe wasn t the right way and Chloe s like it was the right message the wrong messenger so I did like that she like didn t back down on what she had initially said yeah because I like I understand where other people are coming from which is like everyone is working hard at their current jobs yet they re not at the status of Kim Kardashian but I think what she means is entrepreneurs if you re starting a business there s no choice but to put in that work because like especially like if you start a business your real job is your job that s paying the bills and then you re working from nine to five you will drop and then from to on your fake job until your fake job can become your real job so I didn t think she meant it for the world and not every comment is for everyone if you are up and off your ass and working she s not A A talking to you she s not assuming that all of women are sitting on their asses yeah and she didn t A A say that yeah she just said get your ass up and work I heard it I like I like I m like yeah A A I m gon na get my ass up and work and that it s something that rings in my head it s like what I think of like it s like what I say to myself like do it for who you want to be tomorrow where do I want to be tomorrow do I want to be on episode six of the Watcher or do I want to be done with the series and the answer is I want to be done with the series so I m gon na sit my ass back down on the couch and watch this thing all the way through I ve only got to watch one episode so far but I love how it s shot like yeah visually and how they composed it like the music in it I am so in love with yeah Jennifer Coolidge she s just so hot right now she s so happy now I told Lizzy because Lizzy was like put the Watcher on the doc and I was like oh my gosh I m so excited to see it it s like it s a TV show and I said I know I watched the trailer with Jennifer no you said you were a month ago she goes with Jennifer cool I love that you think I m cool enough to watch the trailer with Jennifer Coolidge you have to also bear in mind like I m multitasking I m not reading text all the way through I was like wait and there is a world in which Jennifer Coolidge could have been at your house did what weird things have happened I don t think I d love anyone more right now and I m so glad that she is having like the peak of her career yeah where she s at in this moment I just I like can t get enough of her and I think that people are finally respecting her acting because honestly like she is deep character and she is authenticity I love her I love her did you see the trailer how it was just her like I didn t know what the show was going to be because the trailer was just her giving a house tour like a YouTube style oh no I didn t see the trailer it s just her and it s just her as the real as the real estate agent giving like a YouTube house tour of the house which the house is stunning I love the house um but it s fascinating to me so far I can t watch it at night because the concept seems too real and it is based on real events it is based on real events the concept is very fun for like a few episodes and then the it gets a little tired in my opinion and I feel like the conclusion of it all don t tell me I m not going to spoil it okay the conclusion of it all feels a little deus ex machina like the theater God drops down and he s like and it is over because I said right and for the real family because this is inspired by true events yes uh they never actually moved into the home is my understanding I honestly tried to read multiple timelines and the passive nature of so the the what happened in real life is this family buys their dream home and they start getting these creepy A A letters from A person that identifies I m so sorry I m burping um what is this but um so they keep getting these letters from this creepy guy or person or whatever saying nasty things like I m gon na you know drain your children s blood whatever and it creeps them out so much that they try to sell the house but then because the letters were made public it s hard for them to sell the house I don t think they ever resolved it or found out who did it or whatever I think they didn t they took a financial loss I think they stretched themselves financially to get the house and then when they took the issue to the police and stuff it became public yeah then they didn t get to live in the house and then once it finally sold they took a major loss just to get rid of it to never have lived in this gorgeous house that they bought because the concept was so freaky yeah and had I moved into a house and that was happening to me I would also be freaked out I wouldn t know because I don t get my mail yeah but I do I m not gon na say that okay what I feel like it would be a bad influence thing for me to say okay right the entire season I watched the entire season and is it has Netflix put out like is it doing good like Dom yeah crazy it replaced Dahmer higher than Dahmer it s number one now I think number one now yeah it didn t surpass Dahmer s viewership oh I don t know about the it s number one now but I don t know if it s their past its viewership but it s Ryan Murphy good for him and I saw he actually or at least the first episode he directed the first episode of Donald oh he did yeah oh okay good for him yeah he s a great director yeah yeah I love visually I love it I love it I like him and I like uh his writing partner Ian Brenner in something he wrote a movie called cooties it s kind of funny it s cute it s about like kids getting zombie affected by chicken nuggets and so like a school s on lockdown because all the kids are like ratted zombies it s cute all right what else is on our list um oh did you have anything else for the most recent episode of the Kardashians I wonder why like the demilias they do they drop two episodes at a time yeah and I have to say like maybe I do love the demilius I love the demilius like the show every time I watch an episode I m liking it more and more and I just been thinking I guess I like this reality show though honestly the Kardashians and the demilias are the shows I m living for right now um Yellowstone comes back I think on November th and until then I m just a A A reality very dramatic I know I m a mess I m an emotional mess um but yeah so I love that Charlie s been cast in a horror movie oh that s for real yeah wow good for her you love the show you did you not watch the new episodes well no I watched the previous two I haven t seen the newest drop got it so there s two episodes I haven t seen just yet yeah so she was cast in a horror movie and she s being a sneaky link music career girl now has it come out has Dixie found out Dixie has not found out yet but I m sure she will soon because we re like well into the season and wins that when s the music she s been work because they had to have filmed this a while ago is that what we re gon na draw it s probably gon na drop in unison with when the they drop in on the episode oh that oh press right I don t know but yeah so Khloe Kardashian has come out and confirmed that she s wearing big bandages on her face because they found skin cancer on her face oh wow did you know that I saw you put the headline in the document yeah so she s been wearing huge bandages and the Press has been an A A about it of course and she s also like photoshopping her images to remove the bandage which like yeah dude why the A A not like of course you re gon na photoshop your bandage out let the girl live let her live why yeah so they found uh she had this uh sort of patch on her face that she thought was a pimple for a really long time and then it was there for too long to be a pimple so she went to the doctor I guess she had malignant melanoma on her back a few years ago so when she went into the doctor and they did a biopsy of it they re like we got ta get it we got to get the margins too um they re happy with the margins which means there s no lingering cancer cells around her face and she s probably gon na have an indention or a scar there and but they got rid of it and that is also like the importance of like if you see something that you don t feel that is new and weird or whatever get it tested yeah and I think you should go get your body checked for moles yearly yeah it s not a hard appointment you walk in they look at you for five minutes and then they either take something or you re good to go yeah um wow yeah if she wants to cover the scar I m sure she has a surgeon good enough to do it yeah if she doesn t I mean I respect rocking it s edgy it s cool rocking what it was it s very Balenciaga very um okay so while we re wearing our fish heads that are stunning beautiful a while like totally freaked me out I mean right on because these fish heads are number one um did you see that they were started releasing some images from live action Little Mermaid I only saw the trailer a month back or so oh really yeah interesting there s something new no I didn t know the trailer was out but did you see not a trailer it was it was The Little Mermaid doing her thing so they ve released some more images flounder is one of them and he looks like a A A junkie and everybody was so up in arms being racist about there being a black Ariel that they missed the fact that they totally screwed the pooch on A A flounder and he looks like a straight up Street Fish was that in the same clip that I don t know I just saw still images of flounder and it is goddamn disturbing horrifying yeah what yeah they really A A that up they should have called well there s enough time to change that can you believe that no they did change it for Sonic the Hedgehog there was enough backlash because dude does not look well no not at all this motherfucker s traveling with Narcan yeah the concept of him is okay but it s like the details on him make him look unwell now those are some messy eyebrows if I ve ever seen him you know what I m saying and like a fish doesn t even really need eyebrows I m pulling for the movie I can t wait to see it I m excited to see what they do with it and then last but not least we ve got to touch on the trailer that finally came out for Lindsay Lohan s Christmas movie because you and I have been talking for a month like it was already out but we didn t have the time to watch it come to find out it wasn t out and it just came out yeah and I think it s A A fabulous it looks great Shane was watching it and he s like and I was like I was like gasping I was like oh my gosh yeah yeah she looks good and it looks so

can not move my A A nick with that excruciating pain i like have to turn like this to look at you this is the first time in podcast history i literally considered calling ryland being like i don t know if today s the day started my period day one of my period my stomach is A A killing me and later today i have to go to the dentist and then the auto mechanic what because on the way back and i don t feel like i might have to call the dentist and be like dude i can t move my neck like i can t do this why are you overbooking yourself on your birthday week oh you know what i might be wrong i might not have the dentist today i might have the dentist on may nd you know what i m a mess i don t think i have the dentist today i should triple check that well okay so i on the way home from san diego where i was getting a beautiful full set from my friend alexis martinez at nailogy we know you plug her everything i got a plug because i love that A A uh on the way back there was a car accident and there was a massive piece of this car s bumper out in my lane and i like all my drivers training was like telling me i can t it was an immediate accident like there was one that was unavoidable for us in our car and the car in front of me had the ability to swerve into the lane because there was no one next to them and go around the debris but there was someone hot on my ass and someone right on my side so i didn t have the ability to swerve or slam on my brakes so i just slowed down and went over it knowing full well that my like low rider prius was probably dragging ass because of the bird you hit yeah literally already dragging ass so a piece of this bumper got stuck under my car so we had to pull off the freeways with my friend sarah and sarah steps out of the car right where we pull off into a pile of vomit what the A A and then we pull forward a little bit more and i get down in the gutter and i like i m like what the A A is that weird smell and i realized like i m like laying in a spilled beer in like dirty gutter so we drove home freaking like throw up in modelo and now i have to go to the mechanic and maybe the dentist but who really knows about that my dad told me not to have coffee but i don t know if you can tell how bad i need it i also had hours of sleep last night like i got home so physically exhausted i was like i m gon na go to bed it was like honestly that s your problem you probably slept so hard and rough that you just A A up your neck but i can feel it looking at you like the pain you re in to swivel your entire body yeah my lips are all A A up but i was like whatever this is how it is today and i was like thinking in my head like i look around like this and this is the cleaner side so i m not gon na redo it Laughter joe was like put a heating pad on while you get ready and i was like okay Laughter my poor girl on her birthday week what age is this for you uh this is too old to function that s what s that s what s going on i woke up and i was like wow this is wow don t figure and i asked lizzy like well okay i have a couple of qualms with you of course i feel like i feel one coming i get a mass text invite to her birthday okay you can t call it a mass title it was literally it was like hi all right please rsvp if you re available and i was like you re A A max math texting me for your birthday all no first of all four people are invited oh jesus four people are invited and it s like i individually texted each one of you A A the same thing i know but why couldn t you just like it just felt so formal like your assistant was texting it to me rather than you re just being like if there s four of us why can t you just be like hey A A well because i didn t want to do a group text because that s annoying oh gosh yeah so i just was like what s up guys oh i wish i hadn t oh my gosh you just need to make a decision do you want it i don t well my dad said it was a bad idea and i am so tired he s like eat a banana i was like gross and then she tells me like well i don t want to actually do anything on my birthday i want to just get surgically injected on my birthday but there was no openings at the med spa so we did that last week what kind of what does that say about you what do you mean i love going and getting my fillers in botox sticking needles in your mouth no i hate that that s like what you want to do on your birthday like she wanted to like clear schedule no friends let me go get some needles stuck into my face yeah but why on your actual birthday oh i love it it s the funnest experience like the girl who does my facial is awesome the woman who does my A A filler and A A is also awesome like she knows me and like every time i go in there it s like we ve i just left even though it s been a year can we talk about how her paid friends or her best friends like her nail girl her filler girl you used to be my friend but now you won t talk to me she s like you got ta go see my besties for robo well i think what was so A A up though is like i had had a salad right before going in and i m getting this facial and i m like ripping ass ew i m ripping no you re not yeah and it s a A A up situation to be ripping ass bad because it s like there s two people in the room like you that s why i need jelly to be okay forever because joe thinks that jelly s been farting for years and it s never been jelly because i have some rancid straight up celiac A A ass gas that is oh exactly it s like a rat crawled into my sphincter while i was sleeping and passed away and i can t get it out i just had written breakfast i have a sensitive stomach when i recently filled up oh my gosh i didn t mean to make but that s me and this poor woman is sitting in this room without you no no no how do you know they re going to be silent i never know if they re going to be oh because they like the way that they hurt it s like you know because of the way that they like hurt inside you you re like this is going to be quiet but it s going to be bad and if you re like in a big group you can like pass it and move on i m always shocked when mine are bad like i normally have like a pretty tame like oh this is passable it s fine and then sometimes it just hits you different and i m like if shane s next to me sorry i m not like a particularly gassy girl but like when i am it s like oh man why couldn t i just be alone somewhere right now like why does there have to be people nearby that could potentially smell this because all of them are going to be like are you okay what the A A is that and i m like i don t know man depending on what i ve eaten for the day like i can t go out at night i know i m just gon na be like in the stomach are you like a loud flatulence boy no i just like get uh such a like stabbing pain in my stomach if i have to fart and i can t fart like if i m because i m not going to suffocate those around me for me to feel a little bit better so if i can t do my farting position i ll probably just opt out of the night s events i was in sixth grade and this boy ripped ass as loud as he could and i and he had no shame about it and i just remember it being the funniest A A thing ever and my teacher being like are you A A kidding me he s like what i had to fart like so entitled to his bodily functions i was like what is that kind of self security like and then like i wish i could say his first and last name because the teacher went on a tirade on him because he was like one of those kids so it s like oh your parents have like instilled you with nothing but confidence so he used to do out of pocket like self centered A A all the time and at one point my like core teacher was like listen up first name last name like this is a classroom and you can t just rip ass like that like excuse yourself what the A A kid it wasn t about the farts it was about something else i don t remember what it was but i can still hear him saying the kid s name in that specific cadence and he would just he really would just rip ass freely it was wild and i wish i had that kind of confidence but i don t and i am but i am a psychopath we re all like fart like i did with the facialist and then like look a person in the eye and be like are you okay is your stomach bothering you A A that s some elizabeth home A A no i m just kidding i would never do that i just like quiet and like my face is burning and i m like hope it s not no one say anything and no one say anything okay sorry well i ve been i m i m anxious because i ve been wanting to give you something

of it like if you is it good news well they re a chain chiropractor situation my aunt goes to it and i think my sister in law she also talks about like when she has like when she like sleeps and her

uh you got to remind me to check and see if i actually have a A A dentist appointment after this because if i don t i m gon na go die in my bed slowly well no i think you should go to the chiropractor

all you do is watch tick tock how do you not know what is this it s very self explanatory what it is i was at dinner with my family when i commented what is this and it felt like i was just privately saying it to you i m gon na be real about that when i said that on your public forum i in my heart of hearts it felt like it was just me and you and then i m sitting at dinner and my phone just starts going blue it took a lot of courage for me to post a reel i know because no because i stopped dinner because i was getting a lot of instagram updates and i was like that s weird and then i went oh no because i read one and i was like i posted something not so nice on ryland s instagram and i feel kind of bad about it now because other people are noticing finally i stopped dinner gasps i don t have notifications on for instagram so like i don t see anything if i unless i like go look and i was like i was just curious because everyone s on tick tock and everyone s doing the thing so i was like i don t know maybe like i m not going to post on tik tok yet but maybe i ll make a return to tick tock and this was like me dabbling in the water and then i just A A on it and i m so sorry so to be fair i just also didn t understand like what do you mean what is this like you clearly can tell what it is like what s wrong with you if you don t like it that s fine keep scrolling honest also i will watch a lot of these things with no sound on so sometimes i m honestly asking what is this and then when i saw it with sound on i didn t get any more clarity well it was a natural occurrence it all it wasn t no it was not a natural occurrence that was a recreation if i had everybody no it wasn t you re calling me a bad actress like the kardashians look me in the eyes right now hold on show you you re telling me that was not a recreation of a moment it was naturally organized it was a long time on your mouth with chewed almonds in it let me set you up so i m outside it s a little chilly that day i m taking like my playing fetch with uno break yeah and then i was like it s cold so my car was outside and so i i went to sit in it and i remembered there were almonds in my glove box so then i started eating almonds and i took out my phone and set it up because i was gon na just like do an instagram story of nothing and then i started being like do you ever hide so then it did happen like that and then i thought hmm i guess i ll make a real so it was a recreation no it wasn t that was the first thing but really yeah i was eating almonds in my car and that s way back the tessie tape oh i ve got cameras in there i want to know oh my gosh i will and i ll show you the facts all right you know what i m so proud of you for going boldly and i think i m being extra mean and defensive because i know i m wrong and i felt wrong the second i started well whatever my instagram s growing for the first time in years so good for you wow um no honestly i think it s very good for you to do that because years ago i was just losing point you know the points are like hundred thousand every point s a hundred thousand yeah and so i was just going down points and all of a sudden my point went up the other day and i was like oh my gosh for the first time in years i went and i don t notice it unless it s like a point because it s that s very specific yeah um same with bubs bub s lost probably a hundred over a hundred thousand followers on instagram is he regaining no he s hemorrhaging followers go follow the bubs go follow the sip although not me promising oh the sib s instagram is going to be so good and then like did you ever post that thing we were working on last week no because i cut a whole cute clip for instagram and i go how s this and she goes it s okay and i was like no i think i said it s cute i think i said it s cuter i will never like i like let me go to our text messages which are like psychotically long with just me finally discovering the A A selling sunset A A oh my gosh i honestly when you pitched it to me and you re like it s a it s a reality show that real estate is like snooze like i can t no it s the best thing that s ever happened to me oh my god it is A A absurd this psycho jumps in at season five though and there s nothing you need to know the rest there s nothing i love more than ladies who have spent five hours in hair and makeup to argue in million dollar mansions just also you should we beat them yes i ve always wanted to be them for five seasons i ve wanted to be them and i m psychotically writing out a whole list of questions for christelle as if she s coming on the podcast you got ta come this boy s ready i have like so many questions it s going to be such a good interview christelle i haven t even asked you yet he sent me a screen recording of it because he had to scroll through how many questions he has for you for sure i was like he knows you so intimately that you might want to get security well there s so many layers to what s going on there and i just i love it because it s like shot so beautifully it s the same guy that created the hill so you get that like romanticizing l a like all the best parts of la it makes it it makes you want to move to l a yeah and then you get here and you re like oh it s dirty dirty it s dirty and crowded but when you re watching them it s a fun fantasy world they re all just they even make like june gloom look kind of good yeah and i m like with those outfits and the slo mo of them getting out of the car chris why aren t we getting out of our cars looking like chris why don t you get me getting out of the prius like that i m sorry um also so we did you are you watching season five of course so i haven t finished it yet but i will go home and do that on a heating pad who s the new girl that s friends with the super toxic one that nobody wants to A A with oh her name is is it chelsea yes christine and chelsea okay so chelsea s not really from london right like none of us see i didn t pick up on that but i m not an accent no her accent is like your london accent which is just not a london accent right it s like american australian with a hint of i ve heard i ve heard a spice girl talk out loud one time is there anybody in the audience that believes this woman is actually from london i really like her though i like i like her too i like how they re integrating her into the show yeah i like that she s being able to go on both sides because really christine is always like it s loyalty and if you if you re with them you re not with me and she s like somehow able to like teeter this fine line and why does christine need to have that she christine i love her like she s so entertaining she kind of breaks my heart but it s like she she won t own up to all these girl all all these girls want from christine is for them for christine to recognize that she s hurt them deeply and personally she wants to sit down and just be like yes i but she won t own up to any of it she just like puts her well she kind of tell between her no she knows no but at that lunch when she was late that girl who s getting married an hour late right but listen that girl who s getting married is a heather uh yes so heather was like just own up to the fact that you were late and christine was like she actually her weird A A broke down for a second and she went you re right i m sorry i m late you re mixing up two lunches but yes i ve only seen the one lunch not that far in the season okay also i put this on because i was watching russian doll season three and i finished it and i was crying so hard i started messaging everyone i love like i love you so much like i m so grateful for you tears running down my face scream crying having a full blown panic attack and then i was like i need to stop texting people because they re gon na think i m gon na A A hurt myself or something but that show was so sad and so stressful but also beautiful and poignant so russian doll season three anyways i put on selling sunset afterwards to decompress right and now i m obsessed yeah i like never want it to end i m trying to slowly watch it so it won t end and i i am curious though because christine she ll have small moments where she ll be like my feelings were her so then i try to cover it up but she ll never just say like i m sorry it s always like a backhanded or she just won t it s an excuse and so and i m also curious into how much of that is brought on because if she is the villain like she s the storyline in the storyline she s the villain so i m wondering how much of that is story produced because if she s not the villain no one else is and they kind of need a villain so i m curious in how much of the production is like asking her to continue to be the villain because she s i dead set caught in like her ways a lot of the time and just won t admit it yeah i mean i agree with you that it s a production storyline but i don t think they need to tell her to do much like i think her knee jerk reaction is to be A A because it s like it s like that that saying like hurt people hurt people like this woman s hurt something s wrong with her as a hurt woman i can recognize a hurt woman and she is in agony yeah and she looks fabulous dude she looks so good Laughter also like get all these women a cookie like jesus lort they look empty oh man nothing i love more than a starving real estate with rhinestones in her hair i m just talking the show in general like yeah maybe this is what like the real housewives is and i just never got on board but i just i think the real highlights might be more messy see but i m not i actually like a lot too this season they re doing more real estate than the previous season yeah i personally like the real estate like i like what houses they re selling i like seeing what price points so i like hearing their their methods behind the madness of it all like i love listening to these ladies like when that girl runs out onto the edge of the infinity pool oh my god she s like no this is getting out of the house and in my heart of hearts i m like honestly it probably is like a hot A A standing on the edge of the infinity pool with all of los angeles behind her like yeah that s A A money dude oh i love it yeah and my favorite thing about krishell is like she was married to justin hartley who s on this is us right you told me about her laughter she was with him before he got the show and blew up and then he blew up and their relationship dissolved just because he skyrocketed to fame and he texted her right so is now i think married to another woman but it s just like she was a soap actress and that was that had fizzled out i think for her and it wasn t until after her divorce where she was like okay i m gon na start doing real estate which was probably like a low moment for her because like i bet she loves real estate but it s like okay i m going to like say like acting s not making my full time gig right now so i have to take on another job and it wasn t until she like really lived in all of that that now she s skyrocketed and she s the most popular on the show she has all these opportunities she s like living her very best life and opportunities won t stop coming to her and i just love that she s so genuine and wholesome yeah so come on our show girl get over here crazy girl christelle christelle um i saw a really funny meme about real estate agents just to wrap up that conversation where it s like either you die a bottle girl or you live to see the day that you re a real estate agent and if that ain t the truth honestly i ve never wanted to be the first boy on selling sunset more you re there are boys on it i mean they re the owners of the brokerage right there s no boy real estate get up in there let s get you some highlights let s get you a spray tan get my real estate license i don t know that you need this i don t know that you need a real estate license to be at the o group no we got to get you eyelash extensions that s what you need to get in at the o group and a weave well we ll i ll ask rachelle what i really need i spent my weekend relaxing and watching adam sandler movies like what did you see the newest ones like i ve seen all i watched the old ones on repeat and that was my childhood yeah but i ve been watching the new ones like jennifer aniston just go with it the one with drew barrymore which is first dates no oh that s a great one too what s the one i watched with drew barrymore anyways he s fantastic yeah he s the swedish and i

storyline it makes you laugh it makes you want to cry like it s a good A A movie and there s nothing wrong with that like maybe it s not an oscar contender but what movie you re talking about what s

your day to just like take a deep breath yeah and really that changes a lot so with that we ll get in today s into today s iced tea oh iced tea i was ready for advice and i was like i don t know if i could move my neck like that today oh what wait what before we do iced tea should we intro hot goss uh what oh oh okay yes i had an idea i had an idea for a segment so last year i kind of like got really excited by my own hometown drama between a couple of young women who are not in the public sphere so to speak and i had a lot of fun with some trivial like hometown gossip right and so i thought that like how we have our you know pawdience send us at like advice those segments you guys could also send us some hot goss or hot gossip from your hometown where we could all just like relive and weigh in on the gossip happening in your hometown or your like friend group or whatever we ll change all the names it ll be completely anonymous no one will ever know and this is kind of like what i wanted to do with the nextdoor app but then i realized it would be too toxic because i d be reading like my neighbor s drama and your neighbors in colorado listen and that s where i m signed up in nextdoor and A A was going through the fan this past week like i was like airplaying it to shane and reading all the neighbors responses and i i m not kidding when i say like they ll get comments on a post just dividing the neighborhood on something so trivial and stupid but i live to read for how worked up people get over gossip in their area so i think this is very fun you can submit your stories or whatever to contact the sip gmail com or our phone number is in the description section if you want to leave a voicemail i just ask that you leave them like seconds really like get to the point yeah yeah yeah because it s hard for us to play like a three minute uh clip on the show um also i would like to take a moment and say A A went through the fan is perhaps a saying we should all start using because it s normally A A hit the fan and i said she went through it went right through the fan that s what it feels like it was moving at such a velocity and speed that it went right through the fan and you come out a little wonky like you re you re you have a broken neck it s too soon for next year i wanted to issue an apology to the kardashians why because you saw courtney s grass and it is green no it s not i mean it s not not green but it s not perfect and then yeah in this week s episode they show kylie s house and her grass is what i expect of a kardashian the first review i got from him via text kylie s grass is green it is and that s why i was just like that s what i expected from a celebrity lawn um i also love that kylie light can t even be bothered to be on the episode but her house will be there and not even her security guard shows up on camera like chloe s breaking into her backyard like well wait here for the security guard to bring me whatever the A A frivolous A A was that i needed when i got here yeah and i felt bad because i was just saying the episode was slow and boring and dull and i i love the kardashians i really do but i that episode wasn t for me and i will say the second episode was a redemption for me i just think going to a new platform starting a new like where do we pick up i just felt like it took them a second to find their footing um because i do think the second episode was watchable engaging fun enough storylines like i had requested i was like there s so many family members just jump between them you guys are all living rich fabulous lives yeah but the yeah the premiere fell really flat for me but they came back in the second episode of this for me i thought it was so wild how kim was like so juiced to talk to amy schumer about her monologue she s like yeah michelle wolf wrote this monologue so like let me do it for you and she like does it and amy s just like A A on michelle wolf like everything about the monologue and he s like i don t like that no i don t like that i don t like that and then amy gives some guidance and then kim goes i love amy she s really empowered me i m not gon na take any of her advice and i m gon na go full steam ahead with michelle wolf s bit and it s just like we re being we re all being really polite here but did it not feel like at every turn that was like A A your time and A A your time and A A your time but thank you very much for it i think they all got what they wanted out of it you know like a little air time and some fun was had all around kim did take the joke of like oh amy did picture the joke of like oh like this is nothing for me this is like my inner circle right because it s only million people that watch the show so she did take that but kim stuck her ground and like did the kanye jokes did the family jokes did what michelle wolf wolff wrote for her um and yeah yeah loved it i think i had did i have anything else about that um i added your notes it s hard for me to think i m gon na be completely honest i m so sorry have you been following the kardashian verse blac chyna trial i have and i am shocked and appalled well so here s the thing i haven t been watching well what so what is the deciding factor on whether a case is televised or not because like you can see every moment of the johnny amber trial but you can t of the kardashian one i mean i think i don t know but i think it comes down to like filing motions for privacy and not you know what i m saying see i didn t think you had a choice but i don t know uh all i see are like the sketches like i haven t yeah the sketches they re doing the kardashian fam dirty like it s gnarly what s coming out of there and it s like obviously the sketch artist is like team blac chyna which is scary but i get it because it s like a little bit like if you re not team blac chyna are you in danger so of course you re gon na draw what do you mean i would be are you hearing the details of the case uh you re saying if you re not team blac chyna you re in trouble yeah cause she s gon na get you the only things oh you because she s like you re in trouble by her yeah right i mean i also feel like the kardashians have the resources to burn us to the ground i mean absolutely but that s what blac chyna s claim is and that s why she s brought the lawsuit but i so she s like all like i want my show with rob kardashian cost me this much money and the family did it like because they re A A well i did they re like no the whole trial is based upon her show with rob got cancelled and she s saying had it moved forward she would have made x amount of money so she s suing them for million correct they haven t stated the exact money claim but it s like ranges from million to million and i do remember in the moment the the the hot gossip or the word around town was that the kardashians threatened e saying like oh we ll walk from our show if you don t cancel their show which like that s just what people were saying there s no proof on that that i know of but uh they were probably doing that because they knew how toxic the relationship between uh chyna and rob was well from what i understand from the details i ve heard it sounds like the relationship between rob and blac chyna was crumbling to put it polite i mean the show was crazy yeah they were fighting like like at nauseam on the show and i think that like no A A they re gon na A A cancel this show there s no there s no relationship to film here anymore do you know what i m saying yeah and then did you hear what she did well all i ve seen are the headlines the chris jet like the headline was kris jenner says blac chyna threatened to kill kylie jenner and then there was a second one that said also threatened to kill rob so she held a loaded gun to rob oh i didn t know it was that i thought it was a threat no like she held a gun to his head i don t know if it was loaded actually i don t know if it was loaded i know she held a gun to rod s head and now her lawyer saying that was a joke that s why i said the court cartoonist is probably team blac chyna cause he s A A scared so china s just like this family s done with me i have nothing i can further gain from them so i want the money that she so believes she deserves but it s not yeah but it s also i think um i also and again like i m not educated on the topic but i did hear i think i heard that rob is no longer paying child support because he s like why should i i pay for everything for my daughter i literally he literally pays for everything for his daughter he s like why would i pay blac chyna A A so that was my question was like is she not and this is on the taillight a joint child and see like this case i haven t really i i don t take anything i say no but i just look but like literally the fact that her attorney in a court of law was like she was just kidding that s scary yeah she s like no that was a joke and then they re like all right so after you did that and then you strangled him with a cell phone charger was that also a joke she s like no that was i was just joking then too and then she s like right okay so then when you destroyed the entire house and had a temper tantrum was that real she was yeah that was real like it literally like escalates from that situation to like she s like no that was just joking that was just joking no that was real like it s wild yeah and for the kardashians to take time out of their schedules to not just uh um settle yeah before taking it to court like they re all showing up decor it s just wild and wow yeah wow spooky stuff um the johnny depp and amber heard trial it s just crazy to me that like everyone like fans can walk in and witness it live that it s televised that all the clips are out there it s like the oj of this decade and what s coming out of it has just been mind boggling but i think even outside of the case what s so crazy to me is the culture that we live in that somebody can make a claim against another human that can ruin their life they can crumble their life s work to the ground and what i think is fascinating to observe is now that like johnny has lost his so called movie career like he s not getting jobs anymore he s like well i want the facts to come to life so i can clear my name to set a precedent like i don t even think i think he s taken it even further from career wise where he s like my children had to go to school and read these headlines and have their peers tell them that their father was this kind of man and he says i am not this kind of man so i m suing you for defamation so that i can get my namesake back well and that s what i mean is the the way a person can take another person down and i m sure everyone that has supported johnny throughout his whole life like agents managers publicists friends i m sure they all had they were backed into a position where they had to publicly drop him and now i don t remember i don t know exactly how it played out when it was happening like in the metoo movement but i m sure a lot of people said a lot of nasty things about him and i m sure a lot of those same people are tweeting and saying things in support of him right now and i think the mind A A of it all is just so so insane because he s never gon na forget all of the people that dropped him and then they re probably sitting here now like praising him or talking highly of him so it s like it s just such a devastating run of events i think that it s a really important time too for this to be televised as sort of like because it s like for you to make such strong allegations against a person of that nature specifically where people who suffer in those you know environments of abuse how how dare you because those are the situations where it s like we are inherently meant to believe you and help you and for you to manipulate that kind of human interaction is and sadly there s a lot of i mean not sadly there s a lot of evidence in this case but for a lot of people that have been abused they don t have the evidence right and so it s hard because you want to believe somebody based on what they re saying but it s hard to believe someone without facts when there s bad actors and that s what s so toxic and awful about the whole thing is like there are always going to be bad actors there are always going to be people who bend the truth and i still think that it s our duty as human beings to create a safe environment for an accuser and the accused and that s why it s so important to remember that we like have this system in place where you are innocent until proven guilty and also we need to protect the people who are coming forward with the allegation where it s like all right let s hear your story i believe you and now we have to you know provide the opportunity for this person to be proven do you know what i m saying i just think it s like the court of public opinion is so screwed up that s what i mean is like take it out of this case cancel culture or public opinion in general somebody could come out the gate swinging with something that isn t factual and it could ruin somebody s life immediately and then that person could rebuttal and then everyone s on like it s just like constantly swaying and it s so just counter productive to everything so i don t know the answer i guess the answer for johnny depp is to uh take all of this time effort and money to prove a precedent that hopefully people won t do this when they re not actually yeah i also think it s taking a lot of courage on his part to admit to some of the abuse that he saw because men are not in a position to admit when they have been physically or mentally abused because like society s like well you re a man right you re bigger than her and it s like yeah i do also have to say like there is this other thing where as a woman i personally sometimes feel not in a room full of men who are larger than me because i m like i couldn t hold my own in a fist fight right here right now you know what i m saying and the same is true for men where they can t come forward and say listen i was physically and mentally abused because then you know society s response is you re not a real man you re a A A right do you know what i mean and it s also based on like you also act upon like what you saw when you were growing up and yeah like there s just so many factors that play into all of this so and i think that like again like for humankind the responsibility of each one of us is to be you know kind and respectful and honest and there in a way that s not meant to be manipulating the truth in our favor to hurt someone else or to build ourselves up like that s never the answer and what i what has been interesting to me is there s proof that she s hit or slapped or she said it yes that she has physically come at him so like what is the alternate side because say she s abused him physically times and he reacts once like i just don t like because she is countersuing that he abused her but it s public knowledge and matter of fact that she s abused him so why is she not already like in trouble because that s she s not going to be in trouble for it because this this isn t like he s pressing charges against her for the violence that he faced this is so the the response to what the charges he s brought against her is she says i can t be proven guilty of this because what i said is true i called you an abuser because you are an abuser and because i did that i it s that s protected free speech but if he can prove i was not an abuser you called me an abuser you lied then she is guilty of the charges he s bringing against her in this court or the claim he s bringing against her in this it s also crazy because it s like well he lost job after like his jobs immediately went away from him after the article was published live and she hasn t taken the stand yet we ll see what happens when she does i don t believe she has has she i don t think she has yet either i really want to say something that feels like it s odd it s like not appropriate so can you cut it if it s not okay yeah there was a really funny tick tock that that was going around about amber heard and it s they put a hashtag over it that instead of saying me too it says meepoo because she s A A on the bed i mean i think it is just i think that is i don t think it s great to make fun of the metoo moment because i think it s a really important movement but that meepoo thing really did make me laugh like that really the stuff she would do like put nail polish on a tissue and act like she had a bloody no like there s just endless amount of things that make me believe that she s gone girl it s it s it is so gnarly listening to that tape of her saying sorry i didn t hit you right like yeah i hit you but you like you re such a A A baby and it s just like i m so triggered we re setting like up to like when she was filming his and he was having yeah and then she like is like oh i got the moment and she laughs and then when she puts the ice cream on his lap to take a picture and it s like yeah if you don t feel safe like a you don t have time to film something yeah and b you don t have time like you you get out like johnny was like well why did you leave and why did you have time to film me if you were scared for your life yeah i mean all of it s like really really messy and then the fact that johnny depp has to read out loud the horrible text messages that he was sending also kind of funny yeah i mean even he s laughing at some of just because the way that it s gone about in court is like like the situation is a little bit ridiculous it s like well okay let s move on to a few rapid hot topics and we ll get into some advice though so uh jane fonda says she isn t bothered by being closer to death i just thought it was a fun topic to bring up on my birth week am i bothered by being closer to death no and i also was having a conversation with a friend recently about peaks in life and like peaking in life jane fonda is a woman who s been like at her peak i feel like every year of her existence and i think that that s something that s really interesting to take into account where you a lot of people think that like you have one peak in life right like oh i peaked in high school and now it s all downhill from here it s like god forbid but i personally believe that there are peaks to every season oh and um so life to me isn t just like working up to my best moment and then working down from it but like every year and every day and every moment is an opportunity for something positive even though you know world throws A A at you like my neck hurts really bad but i m in a good mood no my friend sarah gave me a shirt to wear today i had nothing planned and i m looking so forward to like my mid to late s and my mid to late s because i think you have different seasons of your life that bring different gifts and i think we should always be like reaching for something different and something that we can be proud of and like the the um joy for the present moment like just each moment is a blessing and an opportunity to make the most of and i m not saying we have to be toxically optimistic but i am saying that like i i recognize like i could have been really pissed off yesterday that i was A A filthy covered in medela gutter and i had the best day of my entire life like i had so much fun yesterday it was it felt like one of those days where you re like again and it s a summer day and it s it s a never ending day yeah and it just was so fun and so simple and stupid but it was like damn dude like A A doesn t it doesn t get much better than just enjoying the time you have yeah and i and if you re thinking about it in regards to even career like i always think like oh i ve done nothing compared to what i m going to do right like i think there s infinite opportunity for anything to live life to enjoy life to start a new career if you re and you want to start a new career i think you can still have a crazy successful one she s every day um something funny just about like because she says she doesn t she s not bothered about being closer to death something that is kind of crazy is this was back when we were in colorado but shane had a dream where he was visited by a man he didn t know who gave a first name and when he woke up and told me i didn t know who the person was and he goes do you know this person and he was like he visited me and told me to tell your grandma not to be afraid of death like it s like everything s fine after death and it s enjoyable and he went and told my grandma and i don t know my grandma s dad s name and she goes that s my dad s name shane doesn t know had no idea covered in shells and my grandma was like whoa and it really has like comforted her like she brings it up all the time and has told everyone because like how would shane how would shane know that and he was like there s nothing to worry about yeah like it s great on the other side yeah i um spoke because my friend eve gives me like medium sessions and one of the times i was trying to you know have a have a moment with my godmother but i don t like give a lot of details to these people because i m slightly skeptical but one of the things that i got back was something similar to that notion where she s just like like the woman s like i just see smiling and it s like there s no pain there s no struggle here right and like i think that that s very nice and it s like just the the notion of like smile like put your chin up and smile like that was what she just kept saying and it s like that s so lovely yeah yeah very cool wow okay you had put this one in spain issues arrest warrant for tinder swindler simon lev why do you say his name i think you just did it really well okay thanks also you got your simon you piece of A A so what is the story here they re getting him on some A A charges which have nothing to do with the fact that he s ruined multiple women s lives and finances but he s being got finally for something he s there s an arrest warrant out for him right now i did always think it was crazy that anna delvey yeah had faced such incredible characters because her victims were men and corporate america and corporate america yeah they weren t like personal and like one offs yeah like he and corporate america didn t want to be embarrassed by it so they A A her in the ass but then like the twinders wonders out here on A A like ruining people financially and the same corporate america that like or not of america but like corporations that like A A dana delvey won t give these women a break after the tinder swindler ruins their lives which is you know what A A you my neck hurts i don t have time for your A A today Music a few more uh i just saw in the headlines today michelle says that she ll be her bff surrogate for real and i thought wow lizzy s never offered the such baby i can barely move right now do you like want me i told you this a long time ago like you don t want me to house your baby Laughter what if i i went out i felt so bad about it i went out looking for a circuit for you i know it s a no for them too but it s not personal i m so sorry homophobic okay um and then i just wanted to say vanessa hutchins is really having her moment like her phone won t stop ringing she hosted the oscars red carpet for abc and now she s hosting the met gala red carpet she s like the coachella fashion gala season again that s what i found really weird did we just do this in colorado yes and i think maybe because of coronavirus it had gotten pushed way back last year because yeah it s next monday what the A A so should we do another pj party review if we want to but we d have to do a monday night because that s when the arrivals would be okay we could possibly do that oh yeah um but yeah good for vanessa hudgins get a girl oh oh i should have picked this at the beginning of the episode what you mentioned that you re renting out the house maybe oh are you leaving well yeah of course we re leaving like we just bought a house in colorado i know i know so i know that and now that it s getting warmer there might have just been a it would be a vacation home no yeah i mean we re planning to go back in the next month or so so i am preparing for the next month or so because we thought it would be uh not i just for say like i think somebody occupying the house is a good idea just to be here um in case like something goes wrong then they re aware of it because somebody s here but then also like doesn t doesn t hurt to help financially and uh so i ve been like working on like replacing like the huge pictures of like shane and i right um but so yeah we ve been like clearing up the house and we don t know if we re gon na do it yet sometimes family comes and stays and his family wants to do it then that s i m more than preferred yeah because then i don t have to go through all the process of doing like a three month or six month rental um but we re just playing with the idea exciting and you were playing with makeup this weekend you re playing with my makeup so i noticed my makeup room was all tampa well happy

can not move my A A nick with that excruciating pain i like have to turn like this to look at you this is the first time in podcast history i literally considered calling ryland being like i don t know if today s the day started my period day one of my period my stomach is A A killing me and later today i have to go to the dentist and then the auto mechanic what because on the way back and i don t feel like i might have to call the dentist and be like dude i can t move my neck like i can t do this why are you overbooking yourself on your birthday week oh you know what i might be wrong i might not have the dentist today i might have the dentist on may nd you know what i m a mess i don t think i have the dentist today i should triple check that well okay so i on the way home from san diego where i was getting a beautiful full set from my friend alexis martinez at nailogy we know you plug her everything i got a plug because i love that A A uh on the way back there was a car accident and there was a massive piece of this car s bumper out in my lane and i like all my drivers training was like telling me i can t it was an immediate accident like there was one that was unavoidable for us in our car and the car in front of me had the ability to swerve into the lane because there was no one next to them and go around the debris but there was someone hot on my ass and someone right on my side so i didn t have the ability to swerve or slam on my brakes so i just slowed down and went over it knowing full well that my like low rider prius was probably dragging ass because of the bird you hit yeah literally already dragging ass so a piece of this bumper got stuck under my car so we had to pull off the freeways with my friend sarah and sarah steps out of the car right where we pull off into a pile of vomit what the A A and then we pull forward a little bit more and i get down in the gutter and i like i m like what the A A is that weird smell and i realized like i m like laying in a spilled beer in like dirty gutter so we drove home freaking like throw up in modelo and now i have to go to the mechanic and maybe the dentist but who really knows about that my dad told me not to have coffee but i don t know if you can tell how bad i need it i also had hours of sleep last night like i got home so physically exhausted i was like i m gon na go to bed it was like honestly that s your problem you probably slept so hard and rough that you just A A up your neck but i can feel it looking at you like the pain you re in to swivel your entire body yeah my lips are all A A up but i was like whatever this is how it is today and i was like thinking in my head like i look around like this and this is the cleaner side so i m not gon na redo it Laughter joe was like put a heating pad on while you get ready and i was like okay Laughter my poor girl on her birthday week what age is this for you uh this is too old to function that s what s that s what s going on i woke up and i was like wow this is wow don t figure and i asked lizzy like well okay i have a couple of qualms with you of course i feel like i feel one coming i get a mass text invite to her birthday okay you can t call it a mass title it was literally it was like hi all right please rsvp if you re available and i was like you re A A max math texting me for your birthday all no first of all four people are invited oh jesus four people are invited and it s like i individually texted each one of you A A the same thing i know but why couldn t you just like it just felt so formal like your assistant was texting it to me rather than you re just being like if there s four of us why can t you just be like hey A A well because i didn t want to do a group text because that s annoying oh gosh yeah so i just was like what s up guys oh i wish i hadn t oh my gosh you just need to make a decision do you want it i don t well my dad said it was a bad idea and i am so tired he s like eat a banana i was like gross and then she tells me like well i don t want to actually do anything on my birthday i want to just get surgically injected on my birthday but there was no openings at the med spa so we did that last week what kind of what does that say about you what do you mean i love going and getting my fillers in botox sticking needles in your mouth no i hate that that s like what you want to do on your birthday like she wanted to like clear schedule no friends let me go get some needles stuck into my face yeah but why on your actual birthday oh i love it it s the funnest experience like the girl who does my facial is awesome the woman who does my A A filler and A A is also awesome like she knows me and like every time i go in there it s like we ve i just left even though it s been a year can we talk about how her paid friends or her best friends like her nail girl her filler girl you used to be my friend but now you won t talk to me she s like you got ta go see my besties for robo well i think what was so A A up though is like i had had a salad right before going in and i m getting this facial and i m like ripping ass ew i m ripping no you re not yeah and it s a A A up situation to be ripping ass bad because it s like there s two people in the room like you that s why i need jelly to be okay forever because joe thinks that jelly s been farting for years and it s never been jelly because i have some rancid straight up celiac A A ass gas that is oh exactly it s like a rat crawled into my sphincter while i was sleeping and passed away and i can t get it out i just had written breakfast i have a sensitive stomach when i recently filled up oh my gosh i didn t mean to make but that s me and this poor woman is sitting in this room without you no no no how do you know they re going to be silent i never know if they re going to be oh because they like the way that they hurt it s like you know because of the way that they like hurt inside you you re like this is going to be quiet but it s going to be bad and if you re like in a big group you can like pass it and move on i m always shocked when mine are bad like i normally have like a pretty tame like oh this is passable it s fine and then sometimes it just hits you different and i m like if shane s next to me sorry i m not like a particularly gassy girl but like when i am it s like oh man why couldn t i just be alone somewhere right now like why does there have to be people nearby that could potentially smell this because all of them are going to be like are you okay what the A A is that and i m like i don t know man depending on what i ve eaten for the day like i can t go out at night i know i m just gon na be like in the stomach are you like a loud flatulence boy no i just like get uh such a like stabbing pain in my stomach if i have to fart and i can t fart like if i m because i m not going to suffocate those around me for me to feel a little bit better so if i can t do my farting position i ll probably just opt out of the night s events i was in sixth grade and this boy ripped ass as loud as he could and i and he had no shame about it and i just remember it being the funniest A A thing ever and my teacher being like are you A A kidding me he s like what i had to fart like so entitled to his bodily functions i was like what is that kind of self security like and then like i wish i could say his first and last name because the teacher went on a tirade on him because he was like one of those kids so it s like oh your parents have like instilled you with nothing but confidence so he used to do out of pocket like self centered A A all the time and at one point my like core teacher was like listen up first name last name like this is a classroom and you can t just rip ass like that like excuse yourself what the A A kid it wasn t about the farts it was about something else i don t remember what it was but i can still hear him saying the kid s name in that specific cadence and he would just he really would just rip ass freely it was wild and i wish i had that kind of confidence but i don t and i am but i am a psychopath we re all like fart like i did with the facialist and then like look a person in the eye and be like are you okay is your stomach bothering you A A that s some elizabeth home A A no i m just kidding i would never do that i just like quiet and like my face is burning and i m like hope it s not no one say anything and no one say anything okay sorry well i ve been i m i m anxious because i ve been wanting to give you something but i haven t given you something so now i m going to give you something okay is this a good time at first i thought you were like i m anxious because i want to address what you said on my instagram a toothbrush i m a lot no A A you re anxious you re giving a girl a gift that says i m a lot Laughter well no i just this is just like a side like fun gag gift because i was just i m a lot and i need to brush my teeth but it says but i know i m a lot help i just can see you like running around your house like brushing your teeth and it s like i didn t look but is it under wrapped well yes because i thought this paper was so cute but there was only one sheet of it so just don t look at the behind okay she s ripping apart my gift oh my head my neck hurts so bad there was a spider on it oh my god

a hundred thousand subscribers do we each get one no but it s for you no that s yeah it s your it s part of your birthday gift okay well i don t i don t feel right about that don t we want it in here

okay i mean it s like just is it pictures of your penis that i ve never seen oh A A sorry i just i put all the best ones together for you specifically it s like when i turn a certain way it s just like someone s just punching me in the neck as hard as they can i wonder have you ever A A with chiropractors i know but honestly violently i might go because i can t spend my birth week like this but i have heard that like they can t if somebody just cracks you back in the right place you could instantly be better like it could do you have one no but there s the joint in calabasas have you heard of it like if you is it good news well they re a chain chiropractor situation my aunt goes to it and i think my sister in law she also talks about like when she has like when she like sleeps and her back s out of whack yeah they ll crank her right back into position and she ll be like good to go this isn t a promotion for the joint but but maybe i m going to check out the joint i really do need i uh you got to remind me to check and see if i actually have a A A dentist appointment after this because if i don t i m gon na go die in my bed slowly well no i think you should go to the chiropractor um now that i ve been nice to you i think i could be mean to you okay i am ready come get me come for me well over the weekend i took like a bold step in a direction yeah i know oh my gosh no and so i went to just look at it and i never look at like comments on instagram or anything and i look and i like i post a reel and lizzy comments what is this i m like what the A A do you mean what is this all you do is watch tick tock how do you not know what is this it s very self explanatory what it is i was at dinner with my family when i commented what is this and it felt like i was just privately saying it to you i m gon na be real about that when i said that on your public forum i in my heart of hearts it felt like it was just me and you and then i m sitting at dinner and my phone just starts going blue it took a lot of courage for me to post a reel i know because no because i stopped dinner because i was getting a lot of instagram updates and i was like that s weird and then i went oh no because i read one and i was like i posted something not so nice on ryland s instagram and i feel kind of bad about it now because other people are noticing finally i stopped dinner gasps i don t have notifications on for instagram so like i don t see anything if i unless i like go look and i was like i was just curious because everyone s on tick tock and everyone s doing the thing so i was like i don t know maybe like i m not going to post on tik tok yet but maybe i ll make a return to tick tock and this was like me dabbling in the water and then i just A A on it and i m so sorry so to be fair i just also didn t understand like what do you mean what is this like you clearly can tell what it is like what s wrong with you if you don t like it that s fine keep scrolling honest also i will watch a lot of these things with no sound on so sometimes i m honestly asking what is this and then when i saw it with sound on i didn t get any more clarity well it was a natural occurrence it all it wasn t no it was not a natural occurrence that was a recreation if i had everybody no it wasn t you re calling me a bad actress like the kardashians look me in the eyes right now hold on show you you re telling me that was not a recreation of a moment it was naturally organized it was a long time on your mouth with chewed almonds in it let me set you up so i m outside it s a little chilly that day i m taking like my playing fetch with uno break yeah and then i was like it s cold so my car was outside and so i i went to sit in it and i remembered there were almonds in my glove box so then i started eating almonds and i took out my phone and set it up because i was gon na just like do an instagram story of nothing and then i started being like do you ever hide so then it did happen like that and then i thought hmm i guess i ll make a real so it was a recreation no it wasn t that was the first thing but really yeah i was eating almonds in my car and that s way back the tessie tape oh i ve got cameras in there i want to know oh my gosh i will and i ll show you the facts all right you know what i m so proud of you for going boldly and i think i m being extra mean and defensive because i know i m wrong and i felt wrong the second i started well whatever my instagram s growing for the first time in years so good for you wow um no honestly i think it s very good for you to do that because years ago i was just losing point you know the points are like hundred thousand every point s a hundred thousand yeah and so i was just going down points and all of a sudden my point went up the other day and i was like oh my gosh for the first time in years i went and i don t notice it unless it s like a point because it s that s very specific yeah um same with bubs bub s lost probably a hundred over a hundred thousand followers on instagram is he regaining no he s hemorrhaging followers go follow the bubs go follow the sip although not me promising oh the sib s instagram is going to be so good and then like did you ever post that thing we were working on last week no because i cut a whole cute clip for instagram and i go how s this and she goes it s okay and i was like no i think i said it s cute i think i said it s cuter i will never like i like let me go to our text messages which are like psychotically long with just me finally discovering the A A selling sunset A A oh my gosh i honestly when you pitched it to me and you re like it s a it s a reality show that real estate is like snooze like i can t no it s the best thing that s ever happened to me oh my god it is A A absurd this psycho jumps in at season five though and there s nothing you need to know the rest there s nothing i love more than ladies who have spent five hours in hair and makeup to argue in million dollar mansions just also you should we beat them yes i ve always wanted to be them for five seasons i ve wanted to be them and i m psychotically writing out a whole list of questions for christelle as if she s coming on the podcast you got ta come this boy s ready i have like so many questions it s going to be such a good interview christelle i haven t even asked you yet he sent me a screen recording of it because he had to scroll through how many questions he has for you for sure i was like he knows you so intimately that you might want to get security well there s so many layers to what s going on there and i just i love it because it s like shot so beautifully it s the same guy that created the hill so you get that like romanticizing l a like all the best parts of la it makes it it makes you want to move to l a yeah and then you get here and you re like oh it s dirty dirty it s dirty and crowded but when you re watching them it s a fun fantasy world they re all just they even make like june gloom look kind of good yeah and i m like with those outfits and the slo mo of them getting out of the car chris why aren t we getting out of our cars looking like chris why don t you get me getting out of the prius like that i m sorry um also so we did you are you watching season five of course so i haven t finished it yet but i will go home and do that on a heating pad who s the new girl that s friends with the super toxic one that nobody wants to A A with oh her name is is it chelsea yes christine and chelsea okay so chelsea s not really from london right like none of us see i didn t pick up on that but i m not an accent no her accent is like your london accent which is just not a london accent right it s like american australian with a hint of i ve heard i ve heard a spice girl talk out loud one time is there anybody in the audience that believes this woman is actually from london i really like her though i like i like her too i like how they re integrating her into the show yeah i like that she s being able to go on both sides because really christine is always like it s loyalty and if you if you re with them you re not with me and she s like somehow able to like teeter this fine line and why does christine need to have that she christine i love her like she s so entertaining she kind of breaks my heart but it s like she she won t own up to all these girl all all these girls want from christine is for them for christine to recognize that she s hurt them deeply and personally she wants to sit down and just be like yes i but she won t own up to any of it she just like puts her well she kind of tell between her no she knows no but at that lunch when she was late that girl who s getting married an hour late right but listen that girl who s getting married is a heather uh yes so heather was like just own up to the fact that you were late and christine was like she actually her weird A A broke down for a second and she went you re right i m sorry i m late you re mixing up two lunches but yes i ve only seen the one lunch not that far in the season okay also i put this on because i was watching russian doll season three and i finished it and i was crying so hard i started messaging everyone i love like i love you so much like i m so grateful for you tears running down my face scream crying having a full blown panic attack and then i was like i need to stop texting people because they re gon na think i m gon na A A hurt myself or something but that show was so sad and so stressful but also beautiful and poignant so russian doll season three anyways i put on selling sunset afterwards to decompress right and now i m obsessed yeah i like never want it to end i m trying to slowly watch it so it won t end and i i am curious though because christine she ll have small moments where she ll be like my feelings were her so then i try to cover it up but she ll never just say like i m sorry it s always like a backhanded or she just won t it s an excuse and so and i m also curious into how much of that is brought on because if she is the villain like she s the storyline in the storyline she s the villain so i m wondering how much of that is story produced because if she s not the villain no one else is and they kind of need a villain so i m curious in how much of the production is like asking her to continue to be the villain because she s i dead set caught in like her ways a lot of the time and just won t admit it yeah i mean i agree with you that it s a production storyline but i don t think they need to tell her to do much like i think her knee jerk reaction is to be A A because it s like it s like that that saying like hurt people hurt people like this woman s hurt something s wrong with her as a hurt woman i can recognize a hurt woman and she is in agony yeah and she looks fabulous dude she looks so good Laughter also like get all these women a cookie like jesus lort they look empty oh man nothing i love more than a starving real estate with rhinestones in her hair i m just talking the show in general like yeah maybe this is what like the real housewives is and i just never got on board but i just i think the real highlights might be more messy see but i m not i actually like a lot too this season they re doing more real estate than the previous season yeah i personally like the real estate like i like what houses they re selling i like seeing what price points so i like hearing their their methods behind the madness of it all like i love listening to these ladies like when that girl runs out onto the edge of the infinity pool oh my god she s like no this is getting out of the house and in my heart of hearts i m like honestly it probably is like a hot A A standing on the edge of the infinity pool with all of los angeles behind her like yeah that s A A money dude oh i love it yeah and my favorite thing about krishell is like she was married to justin hartley who s on this is us right you told me about her laughter she was with him before he got the show and blew up and then he blew up and their relationship dissolved just because he skyrocketed to fame and he texted her right so is now i think married to another woman but it s just like she was a soap actress and that was that had fizzled out i think for her and it wasn t until after her divorce where she was like okay i m gon na start doing real estate which was probably like a low moment for her because like i bet she loves real estate but it s like okay i m going to like say like acting s not making my full time gig right now so i have to take on another job and it wasn t until she like really lived in all of that that now she s skyrocketed and she s the most popular on the show she has all these opportunities she s like living her very best life and opportunities won t stop coming to her and i just love that she s so genuine and wholesome yeah so come on our show girl get over here crazy girl christelle christelle um i saw a really funny meme about real estate agents just to wrap up that conversation where it s like either you die a bottle girl or you live to see the day that you re a real estate agent and if that ain t the truth honestly i ve never wanted to be the first boy on selling sunset more you re there are boys on it i mean they re the owners of the brokerage right there s no boy real estate get up in there let s get you some highlights let s get you a spray tan get my real estate license i don t know that you need this i don t know that you need a real estate license to be at the o group no we got to get you eyelash extensions that s what you need to get in at the o group and a weave well we ll i ll ask rachelle what i really need i spent my weekend relaxing and watching adam sandler movies like what did you see the newest ones like i ve seen all i watched the old ones on repeat and that was my childhood yeah but i ve been watching the new ones like jennifer

your day to just like take a deep breath yeah and really that changes a lot so with that we ll get in today s into today s iced tea oh iced tea i was ready for advice and i was like i don t know if i could move my neck like that today oh what wait what before we do iced tea should we intro hot goss uh what oh oh okay yes i had an idea i had an idea for a segment so last year i kind of like got really excited by my own hometown drama between a couple of young women who are not in the public sphere so to speak and i had a lot of fun with some trivial like hometown gossip right and so i thought that like how we have our you know pawdience send us at like advice those segments you guys could also send us some hot goss or hot gossip from your hometown where we could all just like relive and weigh in on the gossip happening in your hometown or your like friend group or whatever we ll change all the names it ll be completely anonymous no one will ever know and this is kind of like what i wanted to do with the nextdoor app but then i realized it would be too toxic because i d be reading like my neighbor s drama and your neighbors in colorado listen and that s where i m signed up in nextdoor and A A was going through the fan this past week like i was like airplaying it to shane and reading all the neighbors responses and i i m not kidding when i say like they ll get comments on a post just dividing the neighborhood on something so trivial and stupid but i live to read for how worked up people get over gossip in their area so i think this is very fun you can submit your stories or whatever to contact the sip gmail com or our phone number is in the description section if you want to leave a voicemail i just ask that you leave them like seconds really like get to the point yeah yeah yeah because it s hard for us to play like a three minute uh clip on the show um also i would like to take a moment and say A A went through the fan is perhaps a saying we should all start using because it s normally A A hit the fan and i said she went through it went right through the fan that s what it feels like it was moving at such a velocity and speed that it went right through the fan and you come out a little wonky like you re you re you have a broken neck it s too soon for next year i wanted to issue an apology to the kardashians why because you saw courtney s grass and it is green no it s not i mean it s not not green but it s not perfect and then yeah in this week s episode they show kylie s house and her grass is what i expect of a kardashian the first review i got from him via text kylie s grass is green it is and that s why i was just like that s what i expected from a celebrity lawn um i also love that kylie light can t even be bothered to be on the episode but her house will be there and not even her security guard shows up on camera like chloe s breaking into her backyard like well wait here for the security guard to bring me whatever the A A frivolous A A was that i needed when i got here yeah and i felt bad because i was just saying the episode was slow and boring and dull and i i love the kardashians i really do but i that episode wasn t for me and i will say the second episode was a redemption for me i just think going to a new platform starting a new like where do we pick up i just felt like it took them a second to find their footing um because i do think the second episode was watchable engaging fun enough storylines like i had requested i was like there s so many family members just jump between them you guys are all living rich fabulous lives yeah but the yeah the premiere fell really flat for me but they came back in the second episode of this for me i thought it was so wild how kim was like so juiced to talk to amy schumer about her monologue she s like yeah michelle wolf wrote this monologue so like let me do it for you and she like does it and amy s just like A A on michelle wolf like everything about the monologue and he s like i don t like that no i don t like that i don t like that and then amy gives some guidance and then kim goes i love amy she s really empowered me i m not gon na take any of her advice and i m gon na go full steam ahead with michelle wolf s bit and it s just like we re being we re all being really polite here but did it not feel like at every turn that was like A A your time and A A your time and A A your time but thank you very much for it i think they all got what they wanted out of it you know like a little air time and some fun was had all around kim did take the joke of like oh amy did picture the joke of like oh like this is nothing for me this is like my inner circle right because it s only million people that watch the show so she did take that but kim stuck her ground and like did the kanye jokes did the family jokes did what michelle wolf wolff wrote for her um and yeah yeah loved it i think i had did i have anything else about that um i added your notes it s hard for me to think i m gon na be completely honest i m so sorry have you been following the kardashian verse blac chyna trial i have and i am shocked and appalled well so here s the thing i haven t been watching well what so what is the deciding factor on whether a case is televised or not because like you can see every moment of the johnny amber trial but you can t of the kardashian one i mean i think i don t know but i think it comes down to like filing motions for privacy and not you know what i m saying see i didn t think you had a choice but i don t know uh all i see are like the sketches like i haven t yeah the sketches they re doing the kardashian fam dirty like it s gnarly what s coming out of there and it s like obviously the sketch artist is like team blac chyna which is scary but i get it because it s like a little bit like if you re not team blac chyna are you in danger so of course you re gon na draw what do you mean i would be are you hearing the details of the case uh you re saying if you re not team blac chyna you re in trouble yeah cause she s gon na get you the only things oh you because she s like you re in trouble by her yeah right i mean i also feel like the kardashians have the resources to burn us to the ground i mean absolutely but that s what blac chyna s claim is and that s why she s brought the lawsuit but i so she s like all like i want my show with rob kardashian cost me this much money and the family did it like because they re A A well i did they re like no the whole trial is based upon her show with rob got cancelled and she s saying had it moved forward she would have made x amount of money so she s suing them for million correct they haven t stated the exact money claim but it s like ranges from million to million and i do remember in the moment the the the hot gossip or the word around town was that the kardashians threatened e saying like oh we ll walk from our show if you don t cancel their show which like that s just what people were saying there s no proof on that that i know of but uh they were probably doing that because they knew how toxic the relationship between uh chyna and rob was well from what i understand from the details i ve heard it sounds like the relationship between rob and blac chyna was crumbling to put it polite i mean the show was crazy yeah they were fighting like like at nauseam on the show and i think that like no A A they re gon na A A cancel this show there s no there s no relationship to film here anymore do you know what i m saying yeah and then did you hear what she did well all i ve seen are the headlines the chris jet like the headline was kris jenner says blac chyna threatened to kill kylie jenner and then there was a second one that said also threatened to kill rob so she held a loaded gun to rob oh i didn t know it was that i thought it was a threat no like she held a gun to his head i don t know if it was loaded actually i don t know if it was loaded i know she held a gun to rod s head and now her lawyer saying that was a joke that s why i said the court cartoonist is probably team blac chyna cause he s A A scared so china s just like this family s done with me i have nothing i can further gain from them so i want the money that she so believes she deserves but it s not yeah but it s also i think um i also and again like i m not educated on the topic but i did hear i think i heard that rob is no longer paying child support because he s like why should i i pay for everything for my daughter i literally he literally pays for everything for his daughter he s like why would i pay blac chyna A A so that was my question was like is she not and this is on the taillight a joint child and see like this case i haven t really i i don t take anything i say no but i just look but like literally the fact that her attorney in a court of law was like she was just kidding that s scary yeah she s like no that was a joke and then they re like all right so after you did that and then you strangled him with a cell phone charger was that also a joke she s like no that was i was just joking then too and then she s like right okay so then when you destroyed the entire house and had a temper tantrum was that real she was yeah that was real like it literally like escalates from that situation to like she s like no that was just joking that was just joking no that was real like it s wild yeah and for the kardashians to take time out of their schedules to not just uh um settle yeah before taking it to court like they re all showing up decor it s just wild and wow yeah wow spooky stuff um the johnny depp and amber heard trial it s just crazy to me that like everyone like fans can walk in and witness it live that it s televised that all the clips are out there it s like the oj of this decade and what s coming out of it has just been mind boggling but i think even outside of the case what s so crazy to me is the culture that we live in that somebody can make a claim against another human that can ruin their life they can crumble their life s work to the ground and what i think is fascinating to observe is now that like johnny has lost his so called movie career like he s not getting jobs anymore he s like well i want the facts to come to life so i can clear my name to set a precedent like i don t even think i think he s taken it even further from career wise where he s like my children had to go to school and read these headlines and have their peers tell them that their father was this kind of man and he says i am not this kind of man so i m suing you for defamation so that i can get my namesake back well and that s what i mean is the the way a person can take another person down and i m sure everyone that has supported johnny throughout his whole life like agents managers publicists friends i m sure they all had they were backed into a position where they had to publicly drop him and now i don t remember i don t know exactly how it played out when it was happening like in the metoo movement but i m sure a lot of people said a lot of nasty things about him and i m sure a lot of those same people are tweeting and saying things in support of him right now and i think the mind A A of it all is just so so insane because he s never gon na forget all of the people that dropped him and then they re probably sitting here now like praising him or talking highly of him so it s like it s just such a devastating run of events i think that it s a really important time too for this to be televised as sort of like because it s like for you to make such strong allegations against a person of that nature specifically where people who suffer in those you know environments of abuse how how dare you because those are the situations where it s like we are inherently meant to believe you and help you and for you to manipulate that kind of human interaction is and sadly there s a lot of i mean not sadly there s a lot of evidence in this case but for a lot of people that have been abused they don t have the evidence right and so it s hard because you want to believe somebody based on what they re saying but it s hard to believe someone without facts when there s bad actors and that s what s so toxic and awful about the whole thing is like there are always going to be bad actors there are always going to be people who bend the truth and i still think that it s our duty as human beings to create a safe environment for an accuser and the accused and that s why it s so important to remember that we like have this system in place where you are innocent until proven guilty and also we need to protect the people who are coming forward with the allegation where it s like all right let s hear your story i believe you and now we have to you know provide the opportunity for this person to be proven do you know what i m saying i just think it s like the court of public opinion is so screwed up that s what i mean is like take it out of this case cancel culture or public opinion in general somebody could come out the gate swinging with something that isn t factual and it could ruin somebody s life immediately and then that person could rebuttal and then everyone s on like it s just like constantly swaying and it s so just counter productive to everything so i don t know the answer i guess the answer for johnny depp is to uh take all of this time effort and money to prove a precedent that hopefully people won t do this when they re not actually yeah i also think it s taking a lot of courage on his part to admit to some of the abuse that he saw because men are not in a position to admit when they have been physically or mentally abused because like society s like well you re a man right you re bigger than her and it s like yeah i do also have to say like there is this other thing where as a woman i personally sometimes feel not in a room full of men who are larger than me because i m like i couldn t hold my own in a fist fight right here right now you know what i m saying and the same is true for men where they can t come forward and say listen i was physically and mentally abused because then you know society s response is you re not a real man you re a A A right do you know what i mean and it s also based on like you also act upon like what you saw when you were growing up and yeah like there s just so many factors that play into all of this so and i think that like again like for humankind the responsibility of each one of us is to be you know kind and respectful and honest and there in a way that s not meant to be manipulating the truth in our favor to hurt someone else or to build ourselves up like that s never the answer and what i what has been interesting to me is there s proof that she s hit or slapped or she said it yes that she has physically come at him so like what is the alternate side because say she s abused him physically times and he reacts once like i just don t like because she is countersuing that he abused her but it s public knowledge and matter of fact that she s abused him so why is she not already like in trouble because that s she s not going to be in trouble for it because this this isn t like he s pressing charges against her for the violence that he faced this is so the the response to what the charges he s brought against her is she says i can t be proven guilty of this because what i said is true i called you an abuser because you are an abuser and because i did that i it s that s protected free speech but if he can prove i was not an abuser you called me an abuser you lied then she is guilty of the charges he s bringing against her in this court or the claim he s bringing against her in this it s also crazy because it s like well he lost job after like his jobs immediately went away from him after the article was published live and she hasn t taken the stand yet we ll see what happens when she does i don t believe she has has she i don t think she has yet either i really want to say something that feels like it s odd it s like not appropriate so can you cut it if it s not okay yeah there was a really funny tick tock that that was going around about amber heard and it s they put a hashtag over it that instead of saying me too it says meepoo because she s A A on the bed i mean i think it is just i think that is i don t think it s great to make fun of the metoo moment because i think it s a really important movement but that meepoo thing really did make me laugh like that really the stuff she would do like put nail polish on a tissue and act like she had a bloody no like there s just endless amount of things that make me believe that she s gone girl it s it s it is so gnarly listening to that tape of her saying sorry i didn t hit you right like yeah i hit you but you like you re such a A A baby and it s just like i m so triggered we re setting like up to like when she was filming his and he was having yeah and then she like is like oh i got the moment and she laughs and then when she puts the ice cream on his lap to take a picture and it s like yeah if you don t feel safe like a you don t have time to film something yeah and b you don t have time like you you get out like johnny was like well why did you leave and why did you have time to film me if you were scared for your life yeah i mean all of it s like really really messy and then the fact that johnny depp has to read out loud the horrible text messages that he was sending also kind of funny yeah i mean even he s laughing at some of just because the way that it s gone about in court is like like the situation is a little bit ridiculous it s like well okay let s move on to a few rapid hot topics and we ll get into some advice though so uh jane fonda says she isn t bothered by being closer to death i just thought it was a fun topic to bring up on my birth week am i bothered by being closer to death no and i also was having a conversation with a friend recently about peaks in life and like peaking in life jane fonda is a woman who s been like at her peak i feel like every year of her existence and i think that that s something that s really interesting to take into account where you a lot of people think that like you have one peak in life right like oh i peaked in high school and now it s all downhill from here it s like god forbid but i personally believe that there are peaks to every season oh and um so life to me isn t just like working up to my best moment and then working down from it but like every year and every day and every moment is an opportunity for something positive even though you know world throws A A at you like my neck hurts really bad but i m in a good mood no my friend sarah gave me a shirt to wear today i had nothing planned and i m looking so forward to like my mid to late s and my mid to late s because i think you have different seasons of your life that bring different gifts and i think we should always be like reaching for something different and something that we can be proud of and like the the um joy for the present moment like just each moment is a blessing and an opportunity to make the most of and i m not saying we have to be toxically optimistic but i am saying that like i i recognize like i could have been really pissed off yesterday that i was A A filthy covered in medela gutter and i had the best day of my entire life like i had so much fun yesterday it was it felt like one of those days where you re like again and it s a summer day and it s it s a never ending day yeah and it just was so fun and so simple and stupid but it was like damn dude like A A doesn t it doesn t get much better than just enjoying the time you have yeah and i and if you re thinking about it in regards to even career like i always think like oh i ve done nothing compared to what i m going to do right like i think there s infinite opportunity for anything to live life to enjoy life to start a new career if you re and you want to start a new career i think you can still have a crazy successful one she s every day um something funny just about like because she says she doesn t she s not bothered about being closer to death something that is kind of crazy is this was back when we were in colorado but shane had a dream where he was visited by a man he didn t know who gave a first name and when he woke up and told me i didn t know who the person was and he goes do you know this person and he was like he visited me and told me to tell your grandma not to be afraid of death like it s like everything s fine after death and it s enjoyable and he went and told my grandma and i don t know my grandma s dad s name and she goes that s my dad s name shane doesn t know had no idea covered in shells and my grandma was like whoa and it really has like comforted her like she brings it up all the time and has told everyone because like how would shane how would shane know that and he was like there s nothing to worry about yeah like it s great on the other side yeah i um spoke because my friend eve gives me like medium sessions and one of the times i was trying to you know have a have a moment with my godmother but i don t like give a lot of details to these people because i m slightly skeptical but one of the things that i got back was something similar to that notion where she s just like like the woman s like i just see smiling and it s like there s no pain there s no struggle here right and like i think that that s very nice and it s like just the the notion of like smile like put your chin up and smile like that was what she just kept saying and it s like that s so lovely yeah yeah very cool wow okay you had put this one in spain issues arrest warrant for tinder swindler simon lev why do you say his name i think you just did it really well okay thanks also you got your simon you piece of A A so what is the story here they re getting him on some A A charges which have nothing to do with the fact that he s ruined multiple women s lives and finances but he s being got finally for something he s there s an arrest warrant out for him right now i did always think it was crazy that anna delvey yeah had faced such incredible characters because her victims were men and corporate america and corporate america yeah they weren t like personal and like one offs yeah like he and corporate america didn t want to be embarrassed by it so they A A her in the ass but then like the twinders wonders out here on A A like ruining people financially and the same corporate america that like or not of america but like corporations that like A A dana delvey won t give these women a break after the tinder swindler ruins their lives which is you know what A A you my neck hurts i don t have time for your A A today Music a few more uh i just saw in the headlines today michelle says that she ll be her bff surrogate for real and i thought wow lizzy s never offered the such baby i can barely move right now do you like want me i told you this a long time ago like you don t want me to house your baby Laughter what if i i went out i felt so bad about it i went out looking for a circuit for you i know it s a no for them too but it s not personal i m so sorry homophobic okay um and then i just wanted to say vanessa hutchins is really having her moment like her phone won t stop ringing she hosted the oscars red carpet for abc and now she s hosting the met gala red carpet she s like the coachella fashion gala season again that s what i found really weird did we just do this in colorado yes and i think maybe because of coronavirus it had gotten pushed way back last year because yeah it s next monday what the A A so should we do another pj party review if we want to but we d have to do a monday night because that s when the arrivals would be okay we could possibly do that oh yeah um but yeah good for vanessa hudgins get a girl oh oh i should have picked this at the beginning of the episode what you mentioned that you re renting out the house maybe oh are you leaving well yeah of course we re leaving like we just bought a house in colorado i know i know so i know that and now that it s getting warmer there might have just been a it would be a vacation home no yeah i mean we re planning to go back in the next month or so so i am preparing for the next month or so because we thought it would be uh not i just for say like i think somebody occupying the house is a good idea just to be here um in case like something goes wrong then they re aware of it because somebody s here but then also like doesn t doesn t hurt to help financially and uh so i ve been like working on like replacing like the huge pictures of like shane and i right um but so yeah we ve been like clearing up the house and we don t know if we re gon na do it yet sometimes family comes and stays and his family wants to do it then that s i m more than preferred yeah because then i don t have to go through all the process of doing like a three month or six month rental um but we re just playing with the idea exciting and you were playing with makeup this weekend you re playing with my makeup so i noticed my makeup room was all tampa well happy birthday every i told shane i was like everything that s not for you leave out for lizzy to go through before we don t for me oh my god my neck hurts so bad i m so lit anything that s out is for taking and then we ll donate whatever you don t oh no i feel like it s not so funny that i was such a salty A A when i went in this morning and once have you guys been playing with my makeup okay well

like yes because you ve been raging you ve been going and non stop girly if we will i m out of control and i said you know i wouldn t blame you if you decided that you needed to do a remote episode because you ve been going so ham for so long pause what did you say that i did oh i felt like you pressed for tuesday today is tuesday i know i was trying to get out of tuesday what no yeah and then you told me how much the flights were and i said oh my gosh let s do remote no i said the flights were crazy you re stressing me out shane we decided to just roll i hit roll i love you thanks though we haven t even checked we might be blown out it looks pretty blown out we do look very very blown out shall we come back actually shane shane all right with lizzy not letting me check out our frame we were so blown out and god knows what we look like now that s feeling crazy we re hoping for the best and it s always like i love you but i think because i m in charge of like setting up preparing the documents getting the ads organized i come in and destroy this she s screaming stories at me and i m like save it for the podcast don t talk to me right now she goes these are non podcast stories which she seems to have a lot of so i m like hauling up huge lights and she s she s like screaming stories at me i was thinking i could help i did i had the thought crossed my mind but then i was also like you know what no you might hurt yourself i ll just keep screaming the story and then as soon as we start getting into place of course she knocks everything over and she goes well what would a recording day be without me doing that yeah that s like honest to god if i come in here and i don t destroy everything you better A A check my vital signs because i ve probably been replaced by a reptilian and then she hits record without checking anything and then decides we need to break down that was definitely out of control and then the whole time that we re trying to check and fix the lighting she goes do you think my nose is better like one or two you re doing this wrong or two well i don t know what you mean so this is nose one well show them not me okay this is nose one nose two nose one keep up the secondary one oh i can you can do that for the whole episode it s gon na get weird but i could probably try am i doing it you become nostrily it s nostrily well you sound nostrily when you re trying to make that happen oh hello riley finn we have a surprise visitor wow she is a real floppy dog i took her on a walk this morning in hopes that she would be burnt out by the time that this happened wow she is so beautiful this is a perfect time for me to tell you something okay so i was taking a look at her bite and i have to say riley ann finn has the most beautiful bite i ve ever seen which is very interesting because when we had gotten her they had told us for i mean they can t see what you re doing i know but you can t this isn t a you and me thing she s so pretty and they had like called us and acted like the world had ended and they go there s an emergency with the dog and we said what and they said she had an underby and they made it sound like it was the world s worst thing in the world and i understand how it could be troublesome for a dog because if the underbite is really bad yeah they can have problems like drinking water it just like falls out no problem drinking my water now oh my god her whole head is in my water cup riley anne you keep changing her name can you just prop her up next to you so we can focus and move on first riley the girl s thirsty okay sit and stay she is doing really well with her training so training to just go into your guest s water cups you begged for that you walked her straight into that and then so we called a bunch of vets because the other thing that can happen with an underbite is it can dig into the upper gums and then cause a ton of pain for them and then they d have to get the teeth removed completely yeah and when her adult teeth came in i don t know what happened but all of a sudden her bite is corrected she s no longer a little underbite queen no it s beautiful so icky however is an underbite king he is a little bit of karma i mean i m not watching that i m not anything i don t like that because i never noticed it and then i came home and i was like is that a A A underbite does this little fish have an underbite and the answer is yes yes he does and it is aggressive but i think it s part of the bulldog yeah and if it s not affecting his way of life then it should be nothing really affects his way of life he s a very happy go lucky little goofy movie i love him so much hi girlie riley she s fine she just wants more water she s she s perched she s the thirsty girl she only drinks from water cups all right where do you want to start i don t know man do you where do you want to start i know nothing about you you re unavailable to me i text you everything i do you ve seen pictures and this is i know we talk about this a lot but i just feel like you were in vegas so overstimulated with so many people and you still find time to send me a million links text me a million things and i m like i m just trying to manage my day to day life and i can t keep up with texting you back how can you possibly be thinking about other people when you re so stimulated by a million people in your presence because i only want to be with you that s not true because i m fifth on your text chain only because you re busy okay so but that means if you re texting me that means you ve already also texted four other people no texting that s not necessarily true i text you when i want to text you oh you re taking her from me i understand how much she loved me you had to rip her off my lap i m just trying to get her comfortable and the camera angle isn t even low enough to see her all right there she is oh good eat you so tell us about your weekend it was bat A A crazy do you see what i did there batch i feel like you kind of butchered it but i knew that you were a bachelorette party it was bad A A crazy second weekend in vegas in a row second weekend in a row i m friggin spent bro friggin spent right now what i m saying uh honestly i don t know that i could ever A A with red bull again i feel so insane but catch me at that wedding on september th and i m gon na be gigging so because you can t drink you overdose on red bull yeah which is probably uh not great either how do you go to sleep i don t i just wait i just wait like i m like i like sit there in the bed like i watch smurfs one and two and then you know eventually dawn hits and i can get out of bed it s a lot it s a lot to deal with but i did hit a wall in vegas because i don t like i don t know like i m old man like my body A A hurts like i m tired bro i m hungry you know and these girls are like running on alcohol adrenaline and youth and i m uh you know not are they any younger than you all of them were younger than me wow well except for two girls who were older but they had a rough night like they went hard they shut the club down one almost got arrested they both lost their ids and their wallets you re going clubbing sober dude i went clubbing and i danced because i was like got ta be a good time got ta be a good time this is good times lizzy don t stop dancing and i have this super cute glittery purse that was made out of resin but that really quickly turns to like a weapon on the dance floor so i had to just hold it so i was like a bottle service girl all night just holding my purse like this above the crowd and then at a certain point like i just had had enough and i was like i need to go i m going and some of the other girls were like the bride wants to stay and i was like she can stay so are you the designated dd as well in events like this hell no i m never trying to drive a bunch of group like a group of drunk A A ever i m never trying to drive anyone really to be quite honest but we like left and we go to this uh nacho bar called nacho daddy but i was like if there s ever a time i m getting covered it s eating nachos with my fingers after being in a nightclub and being at thunder down under oh my god we did stuff we did a lot of stuff we went to thunder down under which honestly feels like too much is that a strip show it s not a full strip show but it s almost a strip show and it s too much what do you mean it s borderline assaulty you know what i mean like they verbally assault you like comedians no like physically assault you like i saw one girl get her hair pulled and then the guy smashed her face into his crotch and then he humped her face and they threw a woman on this bed on stage and touched her titties and then later back on the bed and then like humped her hard do you sign a consent form going into these no and that s the crazy thing because i think you should or i think there should be like little lights next to where you are like you can A A with me and you can t A A with me lights oh like you turn it on or off that s actually a hot tip for them because in today s world you never know which kind of girl is gon na come out or boy i m gon na i m gon na touch you hard okay do you consent to me touching you hard i don t know i want you to know the force of which they were humping these women okay well they were bending them over the tables i m gon na do it okay okay and going like hard like with their butts on to their bodies like you might bruise from that i mean they were probably all living for it though right i don t know man i was dying inside and my friend you re sober well my friend sarah was like some girls think this is funny i was like ah i like texted joe before the show started i was like don t worry baby i m not wearing my glasses i can t see anything like it was wild and then even more wild they charged a person for a group shot at the end whoa what the A A did you do it no A A no a person a group shot like with the performers yeah but per person and are there dicks out or do you no there s no dicks but sometimes they grab your hand and put it down their pants no swear to god dude so you can feel the penis i don t know i wasn t part of that tomfoolery i was A A like like the whole time i was screaming in terror because they ll also they re huge guys they re big as A A and they just run off the stage onto your table and like run through the audience and it s like everything feels like you re under fire and then before you know it it s like dark as A A and they like blow smoke through the house so you can t really see and it s a little bit like a war zone and i m A A triggered out the ass from my time in vietnam and then they re on you like charlie in the middle of the congo and it s A A terrifying i don t know if that s a great uh none of those it s all mixed war zones so don t okay don t be it s you know i i don t think it s too soon for a vietnam reference okay i mean i ll let you dig your own grape oh gosh wow what is great people die in wars i don t know i just i feel uncomfortable with all of it for the cancellation i don t know i think it s got ta go i don t think so i think it s pretty i think it s pretty okay i think you re a little too sensitive i m not co signing anything i mean i m more offended by your dog drinking my water without my consent than i am by my you re actually cancelled right now like honestly i m canceling you wait let me finish my story so we get to nacho daddy and i m dying i m literally dying the girls were like we have to stand at the bar because there s only there s no room for everyone to sit because it was four of us who had splintered off from the party group and we were like A A this we re leaving i was like i can t stand anymore i ve just been dancing for hours on that A A floor pretending like i m a fun person to be around so i was like you guys can stand here i m gon na go sit by myself over there like i have no problem sitting by myself anywhere and so i was on my phone like literally couldn t even use my hand to hold my head up because i was afraid to touch my coveted fingers to my face so i was like this and my legs were all like whoop dee doo like couldn t even hold my like my ankles were like bent resting on the chair because it s one of those big bar chairs and the bouncer comes up and he goes whoa girl are you okay i was like i mean like not really my guy and he s like he s thinking i m blackout drunk because i look like a sloppy mess andy thinks i m alone and i had on the bride s bail cause she put it on my head so i m wearing a veil that says bride to be and everyone keeps being like are you getting married and i m going no i m just that girl who makes everything about her you understand they re like we get you and i was like yeah see you later and the bouncer would not believe it he s like let s get you some help i was like no dude i swear to god like i haven t had a drink in years but i ve never sounded more drunk out in public saying like ah and i drink in years he s like are you alone i was like no those girls are with me like all of it s bad like my eyelashes are off i have them on my eyebrows and like on my mustache line like he s like he would not believe i was good i was like i swear to god i m good um losing the girls oh we lost the girls who well well i do feel a bit responsible because i am the sober one so like when i leave someone at the club especially someone who s like i m a bridesmaid in their wedding it s like was that the right choice or was that like what if i lost her and at one point we re all like the four of us get home and then two more get home which means there s two more still out and one of which is the bride and so and nobody knows where she is and nobody can get in touch with her on the phone really and no one can get in touch with her on the phone and the one girl comes in and she s super sloppy drunk and she comes into the house and i can hear her because like we re all in our own rooms with the doors shutting the lights off you guys rented a house for the bachelorette party yeah and i m like already watching smurfs waiting for the sun to rise and she comes in and she goes oh my god we re the only ones home oh my god no one s made it home what the A A everyone s missing and then i hear her start throwing doors open and i m just like not this door not this door not this door don t come in this door and then she throws it up and she s like oh thank god everyone s missing but you and i was like i don t think anyone s missing dude like she s like i don t have a phone i was almost arrested i m never gon na see my family again i m gon na get stuck in vegas and i was like none of that s gon na happen people get arrested in vegas all the A A time i ve flown without a stitch of identification three times like it s not a big deal where the vibe is dark at the air i ve found even as nice you could get the most luxurious airbnb house in vegas there is still the vibes are awful oh no i was positive i went to every mirror and just touched it to make sure it wasn t a two way mirror and some girl was like lizzy you can literally pick the mirror up off the wall you re like that doesn t mean there s a camera somewhere else yeah i was like who needs this many air fresheners like these are all A A cameras this who asked for a fake plant by the bed it s a A A camera i was not naked the entire weekend i never exposed any part of my body in that house it has nothing to do with the house itself it s more of what has gone on there and sadness that just seems like through all the walls it s like a ghost like i didn t want the first night when my friend sarah wasn t there yet i made a girl trade beds with me so i could sleep with someone else in the room because i was A A scared it s terrifying it s a terrifying place to be i m not i don t i don t vibe it but anyways you know eventually the the bride did make it home everybody was okay but it was hella funny that this girl was like all A A up and then the next morning she was like we need to find her ids before we go home and i was like you got ta kiss that A A goodbye you re never gon na find it like she lost her id oh she lost her id her wallet like all her credit cards her phone everything they had nothing they had nothing all of them yeah both of them did i missed two part of the story yeah i ve said it times two girls lost everything they got lost they had no phones there i was like kiss i shake a goodbye baby you told me about the doors flying open but you never told me the cause of where the girls actually were yeah did they walk home i no i think two of them i think they all took cabs but we were pretty close to the strip so they could have walked home but i was scared they were gon na try to walk home and get like snatched or like hit by a car and like left for dead anyways they all made it home everyone s fine then the next morning i was like give up on your A A you re never gon na see it again just go to the airport now and tell them you don t have anything and then my friend sarah who s like a can do girl and honestly sarah can do anything yeah she found their A A she got her their A A back can you believe that where was it it was at the club wow they left it at the club maybe even left their dignity there too i don t know i wasn t asking a lot of questions you know what i m saying but i ve logged everything oh not everything i ve logged a little bit okay we ll be looking forward to that next tuesday i ve personally been manifesting doom without even knowing it that s so unlike you it really is unlike me is it you think i m manifesting doom constantly girl i ve seen you have a panic attack over having to order a squatty potty online using a A A coupon no Music maybe i am a little bit of a nightmare maybe i m coming around to this because lately i m like the most scheduled person and you re right i because i plan everything out if things don t go according to plan i can get like offset pretty easily offset like off my off the set of my planned trail yeah my planned path for myself oh so you re calling the offset and offset but your your meltdown is labeled something else so i ve just been kind of a nightmare lately no i think and it is i mean it is because a lot of the things where i find joy have been um taken from you taken from me why temporarily i don t i mean it s been really busy with work we did like not only this podcast but we have shane s podcast we recently traveled for work we ve been just out and about we have a new addition to our family honey is a conehead right now which is also heartbreaking and i just feel like with so much going on i forget to prioritize the things that make me me which is like having a reset which is working out which is meditating and i think i i got to a place where even shane was like i think you need to like just take a deep breath or like like take a step back or something and i was like i don t know what s going on because it s like for four days in a row i was just like and i feel like i was anticipating everything going wrong and then it started going wrong do you know what i mean because you re already on the most my new things like i d be like oh the dogs are gon na be a nightmare today just because i was like what a way to start your day and then i really like i opened youtube before i went to bed the other day and like from god i don t even watch like inspirational things on youtube but four things in a row were just about different things and one of the videos i stumbled upon was how if you re not checking in on your thoughts and your thought processes aren t good you re manifesting your own doom and i was like oh my gosh the last four days have been me doing this in a repetitive pattern and i really thought to myself oh my gosh you know what i ve been doing i ve been manifesting all of this into my life yeah and you know how i can stop it start thinking positive again you just stopped being grateful for everything i have because i m so i m like such a lucky A A it is so funny that you re saying this why i did exactly the same thing my vlog today is literally all about that and the end of it is me doing a gratitude list to remind myself like of all the things that out that i have that are ow really great sorry horrible pain in my sight that hurts so bad but literally that that s everything you just said is the end of my video i think it s because i used to wake up and the second i woke up i d take minutes to myself to meditate i d go work out and because things have been chaotic i need to find a new normal in making sure i m checking in on checking my thoughts because it really is easy if you re not thinking about what you re thinking about to slowly decline it s easier to have a negative thought than a happy thing which is why lady and i would say like my level median is pretty happy like i would never say i ve struggled with depression and so this is more of just like me being in my own whatever for whatever reason but yeah it s just very interesting so like if you re feeling and manifesting your own doom just stop it just stop it just think about A A that A A off and once i started thinking oh how lucky am i for the same things that i was getting agitated about yeah complete shift yeah and i think it s just and i prioritized that day what i needed to do for myself over everything else because i also have a lot of stress about work like i haven t posted a vlog in a few weeks and i feel like really guilty about that for some reason yeah let that go it s hard for me to do because i feel like a lot of me is tied to it s like what am i doing if i m not i don t know it s very weird but you know i m just trying to give myself a little bit of yeah give yourself a break gratitude lists are dope even if they re like super minut simple simple things like oh i m so grateful that my body is working i m so grateful that i have life i m so grateful that i can breathe i m so grateful that my i blink without thinking about it can you imagine having to think to blink every time you blink oh my god you want to talk about problems A A if you forget to blink dry eyes are a real A A thing yeah well we do have

pick up lizzie from the airport this morning because i didn t know if you were coming in or not so i ve been scheduling my life i know this is going to be very unrelatable and it s like but you know what it s what s going on rip the band aid i ll rip the band aid off because i had a trip to the store the other day what store well i was going to the shade store because i need a blind for blind i need a roman shade for my office what s a roman shade it goes like it s like when you pull it up it s stacked in like little like these no these are uh how do you pull it up shutters you can do a chord you can do it you re curious yourself yeah i wan na know well it s because i m doing my office and i ripped out the shutters in my office because shutters are black out and even when they re open they still leave the room pretty dark and when i m working i like a very bright space so it s more as a decorative accent than anything it s like uh it s a it s i chose this like boucle fabric that s just going to tie in the room so wonderfully so i wanted to go to the shade store to do this and when i was leaving to go do it there s dirt roads to exit my house yeah and you wouldn t believe the fights that these neighbors get in over the dirt roads or paving the dirt roads because this is a neighborhood that in its origins was farmland it was out way out it was um in the middle of nowhere which is what a lot of people wanted and over the past years it s become more commercialized our town has gotten a lot bigger so i hear i haven t been here forever but a lot of the neighbors are very angry about how big and commercial it has become so they don t want they don t want paper they ve been paving a lot of the roads in our neighborhood and all open next door and you ll get into a hundred comment battle of people like pro paved roads against paved roads yeah and i hear both sides but i A A hate the dirt roads and i know like i am the problem i m like coming in from california and also ruining the land that they love so much but this is just another reason i think it s like harder to walk the dogs i think it is it makes your car dirty i just love nothing about it their counter argument is that it allows people to speed through because when it is a dirt road you have to go a little bit slower it s harder to speed and there are a lot of deer and fawn and people that speed do often kill them on accident so i understand the integrity of the speed limit but this was just like hit the nail on the coffin for me because i was driving the g wagon down the dirt road somebody flew past me oh so the dirt road s not keeping them down not keeping them down at all they re just flying by i think they had a big truck so they don t care what they re doing and flung a rock at my windshield hit it i was on the phone with my mom and i was like oh no oh no i never take the dirt roads i go out of my way it s a two minute detour to go out of my way like he s like oh gosh what s wrong ryland ryland he doesn t tell her oh no she goes did you get a car wreck right right and i m like no no you re so dramatic what i mean yes i am dramatic because it s a pain in the ass yeah like and then you have to go about figuring out how to do it and i thought oh well they can just do a repair but by the time i had parked at the shade store it had seeped all the way through the entire width of the winches and because it s like an exotic specialty car i m calling the dealership and they re like well it s gon na be four grand and i almost passed out because that s too much what the heck like absolutely no way but if i ever want to resell the car which i ve been heavily considering because i do love the tesla so much and i don t really need two cars and it s like yeah whatever so i ve been considering selling that car i can t just get like a regular windshield on that window if i m then going to sell it and be like here s a g wagon without a g wagon windshield yeah um so they were saying mercedes won t work with insurance companies and then i m calling every other glass company in the world and they re like no no no and then my insurance is like we ll cover a thousand at the four thousand and i was like well my deductible is that makes it whatever and so i finally found a nice man after spending three hours this was a lot of work on my end to save this coin i honestly can hear that that s a nightmare and i finally found a guy that was like oh i ll work with the insurance company for you most of the agents that work at the insurance company don t know how to submit this request it s a special request that you have to get approval on so i found my hero but anyways that s where i had to go this morning while lizzy was arriving to the house so instead of i think it s only going to cost me like but still just to leave my in yes instead of that s a great deal also too much can you and that s what i m really pissed about the principle you just leave your house i love that you re also so dramatic even with my four thousand dollar spending spree ends up it s seven hundred and fifty dollars yeah after like so much hours so many hours yeah you know how many hours of work i had to put into this days probably yes like at least three days yeah yeah an hour each day A A that noise i got ta cancel my appointment with mercedes but they did okay whatever so that s me and then on top of that honey she i didn t even realize she had a mask in her ear because she s a really furry dog yeah it was tucked down in and she has these ears that are constantly up and it wasn t until a neighbor stopped me on a walk to talk and the sun was brightly shining that i saw this little mass on her so i took her to the vet and the vet was like well i don t think it s anything other than a mass but you can never be sure and so she had to go in and go under and get it because it s a very sensitive spot that does bleed a lot so they had to remove it they have to stitch it up and now she s in a cone for two weeks baby bubba s had a couple of lumps under his armpits that were fatty cells but they tell me right away like i don t have to wait for the biopsy do they poke it yeah so they ll do a fun needle aspirate and then i m so traumatized from everything that i ve been through that they know when they re compassionate to it so they come out right away within minutes after they look under the microscope and they show me pictures from under the microscope to be like these are just fatty cell tissues it s nothing to worry about and this lady i will say i had a different vet the first two times i was there and then the second vet that we got on this time around she did call my dogs fat first of all second of all she was like i can t do the poke but it s in a spot where if i poke it i don t know how much it s gon na bleed and i don t know with all of that blood if i m going to be able to get an accurate test of if it s just fat or not and i was like okay i ll trust you so that s why we just went ahead and got it removed i would have loved to go on that route but i don t know we re removing his body lumps anyways but we re just gon na do it when he gets his teeth cleaned and do they have to get stitches or is he yeah he ll have to wear a t shirt for a couple weeks oh i mean that s better than that he s gon na be so cute i love him in a t shirt he s such a cutie patootie with his little weird body like he s just such a weird shape he s like a wish corgi like you know what i mean like a budget corgi he s a kirkland corgi well we re gon na run out of time but when we come back ice tea what do you mean what do you mean what do i mean when we broke down you said oh i have so many beefs to pick with you and it felt like an attack no it wasn t an attack it s just like i don t know this weekend your mom slid into my dms hey vicky was like i love you liz i said i love you more i said vicky we re married women how is this beef with me it s not beef but it s like i could be your stepdad no offense bruce you ll never replace me you know i ll never replace you but i could now you re calling my mom a lesbian no but you could call me daddy if you wanted to like i could be your stepdad i had proof that you weren t a lesbian the other day what was the proof i had asked you something and you were oh my gosh oh you know what it is you don t enjoy any of the gay shows i love what do they get shows about all like the gay storyline like every time i like try to turn you on to one of the gay shows yeah you re like not for me and so i just like you re not like relating to i m not saying you re saying they re bad but you re not relating to the game the storyline it s like i am and i was like just keep trying you re gon na love it and that s how i know for sure you re not gay because like you don t like any of them right right right but for vicky and i ve been forced to watch straight things my whole childhood wow thank you for defending my heterosexuality i really appreciate that after you re trying to get with my mom to be my stepdad i feel like you re vindictive enough to do that just do you like start planting seeds of like my dad cheating or something so that you can rip that apart that s why i don t even think try to get my mom whoa i don t even think that s how strongly i feel about my relationship with your mother i think i could just slide up in there you know what i mean i did start watching uncoupled did you see any of that on netflix i put it on for five seconds and then right james came in the room and i was like you can change it this looks like trash i loved it i loved it i mean it s cheesy and over the top in some parts and some pipes you re like a little bit cringy but then there are really good moments but it s overall like an enjoyable binge i watched it all probably in two days and it was so fun yeah so go back don t be embarrassed but it is one of those shows where like shane would walk in and i d be like i m not watching anything james kept being like is this a commercial why does this look like a verizon commercial i was like it s not a commercial put on shark tank i don t give a A A there is one dick in there too so oh look full dick wow that s supposed to be neil patrick harris s but it s not no absolutely well maybe i ll go back you should go back you want to know how i also know you re straight you re going back for the dick i just told you about right that s not gay that is not gay of me guys no i ll never have to wonder thank god i picked this beef with your mom what while you brought up shark tank is it a is it a weak uh entry point to our iced tea oh no it is not people are waiting on baited breath to see the queen of goop herself gwyneth paltrow hitting the shark tank yeah just enough circling the shark in the teaser not one but two bombshells for me okay it s the bombshells for me what s the second bombshell well it s and you casually left it out uh let me preface this with kovid during like the height of kovid where no one was leaving their houses we were lysoling our groceries shane and i did nothing but watch shark tank and there s a million seasons yeah and we kept continuing to watch and now we watch as the new season we have been watching as the new seasons air but this past season shane and i had fallen off because it feels like they ran out of entrepreneurs with um invented like new innovative innovative ideas it felt like it was a step in repeat and like getting bored we ve seen something like it before and it was like uh it s kind of falling flat and i will say the times that i found it interesting was when like chloe and kim and chris s business partner that girl that s like their brand per they have like a business partner partner that s a woman that does like the skims i forget her name everyone s probably screaming at is that the one that has cancer she has cancer no you would know this one has no hair and she wears a scarf on her head oh no but she s like the head of good american got it alongside khloe kardashian and alongside a lot of the kardashian brands like she is their woman that runs their brands alongside them and so i thought that was very fascinating and then they ve been bringing in a lot of big celebrities and now to see gwyneth i think i know she s polarizing to a lot of people because her products are unattainable because they re so expensive and she s such a silly goose but i kind of live and i m sure you do i m sure you do i don t buy her products roman drapes guy over here loves gwyneth paltrow i m sure her house is filled with roman drapes okay although i yeah okay yeah she s unrelatable but i think it s invaluable um information for an entrepreneur to have i mean she has made something of herself outside of what she was initially known for right and i think her company does really well and i find it interesting i am still confused about what her company is and does and how it makes money is it an ad space thing no she has it s a store front it s an online store front i think they might have a location as well so it s like a boutique an online boutique that sells like very expensive skincare makeup beauty products it s a woman s life uh i think they ve also entered in the men s space as well but it s a lifestyle brand i definitely hate watched think the original push right yeah and then she collabed with push she did collab with push like my pushy was that their candle club i don t know how it ever came to fruition we watched a little bit of it on the kardashians uh but yeah gwyneth paltrow is going to be on it and i just think it s going to be interesting like i m tuning in for her but the second bombshell is that it s live they ve never done that before that s A A wise in premiere they re going to be doing it live wait what do you mind in real time which a lot of the sharks have been open and honest about that for the pitches go on for sometimes hours in the room and they cut it down to like the six or seven minutes if your pitch is taking an hour it s not right well they get into the nitty gritty of the question if it s like a million dollar business they ve got to understand they ve got to unpack it okay that adds up are they making money are they not making money but i think as from an entrepreneur s standpoint that s why shark tank is so fascinating because it s like it s business advice in a show while also being entertaining yeah you throw my strongest business advice out the window every day oh lizzie wants me to start a brand i just i at leisure for men you could be the fabletics of men someone else can have it i mean viori i already have a company that i love like i already go i have a go to but how much does this A A cost a lot make it attainable for every man do you know how A A rich kate hudson is now from fabletics grow up A A i m sick of it maybe one day so anyways i am very excited about the shark tank premiere it got me all wet and wild when you sent me that article and i didn t even think you watched it so i was shook that you put it on the document i have it on while i m editing but it s like i have headphones on and i m not like listening like my favorite part of it is the hey sharks hey sharks that s what i live for hi sharks hello sharks so you re just waiting for that next hit yeah every six minutes hi sharks you know what i m saying like how many variations can we hear it we know well while we re on that subject should we ah i feel like in unrelatable celebrity news yeah kanye west is out here doing the most oh what what about him what do you mean what about like which element of the most are we talking about his trash bag fashion line at gap which is literally a like a like the manifestation of derelict from A A zoolander wow isn t that wild yeah it is so like what was a joke what was such a joke years ago is our reality in guys no she s fine she s sleeping right here sorry okay so kanye west has the derelict clutch was it in trash bags it was in trash bags on the floor in gap it s in trash bags on the floor and gap i didn t in gap even yeah so this isn t even an inventive idea no he s collabing with the gap i know but he stole this from zoolander i mean he might not know that he did but dara leek all i can hear every time i say that by the way is dare to leak my balls i don t remember the clothes and trash bags on the gap floor in the movie well they re not on the gap floor of the movie they re just on the runway but it s trash and he s got and kanye has his A A and trash bags on the gap so he s demanded that gap displays his clothing in trash bags when you walk in the store and it is wild because should we go to a gap do we have time while i m here no i m starving so my whole thing with this is they ve invested so much money into kanye and in this collaboration that the influence he has over this like typically streamlined square company he has them putting clothes in huge trash bags for people to dig through inside of the store and this is after the years he s had he still has this kind of power i just can t believe it because gap is such like a boring brand oh it s like preppy go lucky but you can t say no to kanye i guess why would you and he s what they imagine what happened we need to get kanye out there requesting that people dig through the bags to find sizes and that employees don t help customers find what it is they re looking for no that was a request and i guess he made a whole song about hating his time working at gap which i didn t know that he had ever worked at gap i worked at gaap did you know this about me no i love do you know that i love the gap my first credit card was at the gap really yeah when i was sad i used to go to the gap and it s a thing that people know about me it was like the gap is where i you can find me it s one of your identifiers yeah it s it s like it s like people will claim it s not a personality but it s like it s a A A personality i grew up my mom dressed me in gap growing up she like manifested me because they used to call it no this is american apparel out of business from my clever days wow a relic it s so soft i was so embarrassed out in public like this because i have like ripped jean shorts on and this and i felt like i look like a year old teenage boy and i m like walking around talking to people it s not a bad vibe i felt crazy uh but yeah i was shopping at gap because i had an audition to go to i was uh not busy but i did get a lot of interest from commercial agents back when i was didn t book any of them really i had a couple of commercials okay you re gon na be on the movies and uh yeah i was shopping for an outfit for a commercial audition at gap got recruited to work at gaap worst job i ever had i mean and not on them i just hated A A retail it was at the grove one of their busiest flagship stores people are pulling all the folded clothes it s also one of those and then you re having to fold the clothes that people have looked at all day long and black friday was really like it for me it was the worst day ever and then the next day i got an audition during a work shift and i thought instead of calling out sick i m just gon na quit so i quit did you call to quit or were you just a no call no show no i called and quit oh i know call no showed at james purse forever and i used to get texas and she was like are you gon na work this next shift it s like what do you think what i hate about that is you re screwing over the other employees because then they have to come in gap it was so big that if one person doesn t show up they re gon na be fine well the same thing is true like i was working at a james purse that was in bloomingdales which means that not only like you only need one girl there at a time and they always had two shifted and no matter what neither of us makes commission we re just paid hourly and blooming deals associates can sell our A A too so i wasn t leaving anyone high and dry and i don t know about now but it almost wasn t worth your time back in the day to work at these retail jobs because it was like eight something an hour and it s like i could work hours a week and still not be able to pay my rent at this job i was like that s that s where i was at i was like what the A A like i work and they don t give you a lot of hours no and then you re like can i get more hours and they re like no because you re a A A employee and you have to write you up for doodling every day i m like don t you feel silly writing me up for doodling we re both grown women and they wouldn t they wouldn t fire me which was very confusing very confusing indeed okay well while we re on the kardashians i guess you have like a three point hitter with the kardashian so i ll let you get into what you turned out for us it starts right at the top liz theory oh this is unsubstantiated false claims and allegations coming straight from the source i shouldn t what i just wanted to rub in your face how right i was the other day about the cheese did you read any of our comments on the previous oh yeah you were right thank you you re right because you took such a hard stance against me in real life no but most people can t pronounce gear i know but you took a very hard because i misunderstood ava by the way ava said it s guiller okay okay but it s guerrier in and of that in that same realm i did contradict myself the way that you re holding me here is intense and you re doing it off camera so that people don t know and the people have a right to know what else did i do off camera today that was crazy i don t know and you were like i m gon na tell them A A i don t remember i m my mind is so overstimulated i m not holding on to anything well uh oh i did contradict myself in that though because on shane s podcast a lot of people were actually pointing out that i had said so like i had misspoken to the bookkeeper about something that related to sex when i meant something completely different and i was like why don t you guys just call me out and they were like you get mad at lizzy when she calls you no one s allowed to call you out but now you re asking somebody else to call you out and i i do like to be called out or corrected i don t at the beginning of this podcast you said all of the sudden again you don t like to be called out you don t like to be corrected you go and you re not gon na change and you have lipstick on your teeth listen if it s something that you have addressed with me previously and i ve registered it when i m in the middle of fine registration i ve taken a beat i ve acknowledged it and said okay and processed it now listen what is processing easy that you grow and change or that you just hear it get annoyed say okay and then throw it out the window it doesn t say recording anymore let me see why is this happening to us stop gasping it did stop recording so we got ta quit our lives i think this is one take four wait wait okay now go one take four guess what the doom manifester manifested today no i ve been in a good mood the last two days so i haven t been manifesting anything bad but first thing he says is ugh i can t believe our fight wasn t caught on camera well yes we ran out of memory on the card and that is because chris isn t here A A you chris you really A A that up didn t you screwed the pooch again brother oh well he was here for a week and then i was trying to get her whatever it doesn t matter he was booked and so i was saying if you have corrected me and we have acknowledged it and thought about it fine when it bothers me is when i m in the middle of the story and you stop me to correct me on something you ve corrected me for a million times right it s not that i mind being corrected it s that i mind being like well but you don t it feels like you don t mind being wrong and never changing i ve changed all of a sudden like i would say of the time i do it correctly just not today or yesterday but some days sometimes it just doesn t feel necessary on your end like we get it we know i didn t correct you today i know thank you very much there have been a few other words that i just like can t remember but like i know today for sure when i was watching your shane s podcast and shane said the thing about making the day calendar of ryland s words i hit him up and i was like i m gon na need it on that that is definitely a business we can co run together okay it was a fight i didn t need to pick what were we talking about your theory my theory kylie jenner um no yes okay so this theory is completely made up i just thought about it while pooping the other day but have you noticed how we have yet to see the two new the two sons the new sons oh oh kylie s and chloe s via surrogate the unseens but when confirmed well we ve seen like limbs kylie s we ve seen titties we ve seen his little feet titties hoodies oh little titties and chloe well i don t i should have she been silent uh chloe s been radio silent on the baby front i haven t even seen so much as like a pinky or like the back of a head like nothing on this baby nothing and it makes sense i mean with the public scrutiny around her relationship she probably just wants to keep these special moments to herself without the public weighing in especially until she s ready her mind s probably throbbing with their like her own A A A A thoughts because as we said like as we discussed earlier it s really hard to maintain a positive outlook but i think no matter what she loves this baby she wanted these babies to have the same dad who gives a A A what tristan s up to you ve got your babies you re a mom yeah um anyways my theory is that they re saving images of their sons to up the ratings on the new hulu show to validate their paychecks and i don t know if that s accurate but it s a good theory because google the readings are they love i tried when you put that in the doc and hulu stands by it was the biggest premiere that they ve ever had but they don t know they don t have to show their numbers like netflix right and when i googled it it said that their numbers are sometimes public but i did a five minute search and couldn t find the ratings on the kardashians so maybe i m stupid but i personally couldn t find them so i don t know what we re talking when we re talking numbers for the kardashians but that would be fascinating i steal a hundred percent of the content i consume and i paid for a hulu membership so that i could see the kardashians the second of theirs right and i did fall off that first season i didn t finish the last two episodes because i got too bored it s way better produced but it s not great i love all the girls like i like the family in general but i it didn t happen general jenner oh i thought okay yeah generally he loves being corrected i mean that was like a pun whatever i probably will start again and i think you wouldn t be wrong like they ve made a living off of publicizing which i m not cr publicizing their personal highs and lows which like guilty hello i do the same thing but uh yeah you could be very right on that yeah it just feels right in my soul and i know that we go over this all the A A time but we got a hundred percent confirmation joe jose was no longer with kylie unequivocally true they are no longer the lesbian couple of the century she didn t add it to the document because she knew i probably would have erased it well the thing that s so funny is like my obsession with jojo has got has like landed me on lesbian tick tock so i m so grateful for our conversation earlier because i was like is she is it joking have you ever flicked your bean to jojo because that would be the game that would be super gay not an issue of h yes okay thank god that s more offensive than a vietnam joke whoa whoa kim kardashian s thief says he feels no guilt for gunpoint paris robbery the exclamation in your voice when you started that headline was too much what do you mean you did it like my reporter works kim kardashian s robber says and our next ice cold sip of iced cold tea this is wild though so he s saying he feels no guilt for holding her at gunpoint and for robbing her at all he says if she s flaunting it then she s asking for it to be taken i don t know if anyone s asking for their life to be threatened uh with their life being held at gunpoint yes pretty A A wild also like is he just out now i don t know i i did also try googling that i said what what did the what was the sentence of kim s robbers and it was all flooded with articles talking about this so i couldn t even get to the nitty gritty of the picture of punishment was the picture of him on the article i saw looked like a super free guy that s infuriating yeah and i know it happened in paris so it s different obviously from where she lives and i saw that there i don t know if they ve gone to court together yet so i think if she does go to court with him it s going to have to be face to face which i don t i couldn t imagine anything worse honestly i honestly don t know how the french judicial system works me either and they did make it very hard for me to find if he s been convicted for a crime at all which would be awful if he hasn t been but again don t come for us for your facts don t come to us for your facts no no no no don t come to us for like anything besides like a good hang on you know maybe a hike and sometimes not even a good hang i flopped on the memory space manifesting doom mariah carey is attempting to trademark queen of christmas as if we haven t already what do you oh silly A A that s crazy that s your delusion no no no no no no no it s not yes no it s not we haven t even gotten a christmas movie picked up and you re trying to come for mariah carey the actual queen of christmas her songs in our movie like we can afford that yeah we can if it s we re manifesting greatness not doom you silly A A oh yes yeah so mariah carey s song is in it and there s like at the christmas pageant everybody s dancing with the same song and eventually the emcee is just like ugh we got ta start diversifying our christmas music i don t know why anyone would want to but i like the sentiment for the script yeah um and people were mad about her saying that yeah oh i m not saying it she submitted a trademark to own the rights to the queen of christmas it says sparks battle but i m gon na be completely real with you the second i made this about myself i didn t look any further so you re i did my homework this morning and i know you re late it s crazy and you put in links to the document and didn t even realize what was going on no don t go to the next topic yet no i m not ready to move on yes i clicked it some lady that i don t know personally is all outraged because i guess on some talk show she was coined the queen of christmas she has the same because she did she better A A watch out because i m coming for it too A A can i say without saying how you make everything about yourself like a human being was named after you and lizzy goes she was ecstatic and i go is this even about you at all and she goes no but i ve made far less things about me personally that s true that is that is something about me that is very true i just can t imagine if somebody named their kid ryland never met me in their life but i knew of them so i said that is about me whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this person i know personally but you said it wasn t about you no it s not she s not naming her baby after me but she named her baby after me okay a little baby came after me okay when i saw that literally i swear to god i screamed started sobbing i wasn t gon na talk about this till next episode okay well we ll save it we ll put pin in it well i feel like i m in trouble now that we even we got to take that out a little bit maybe what i know she hasn t been announced yet we nobody has any idea who we re talking about okay there s not one person except for her herself okay i don t know i mean now i feel like i m i m outta someone truth be told i put it in my vlog but i believe you want a vlog exclusive that s what you re doing here no i bleeped it okay i bleeped it and blocked and like blurred it okay so no one knew it was about me okay but one friend was are you dying over your namesake and i was like yes so people are i guess the people that are outraged are saying that christmas isn t something that you can trademark or own and while i understand that sentiment it s like she s coining queen of christmas yeah qoc and it s like cute has anyone made more money capitalizing on christmas no if she wants it what s going on hallmark might have made more money capitalizing on christmas maybe you re right let s pull up those numbers i can t even find the kardashian numbers or whatever else we talked about so of course i m going to find these of course i m going to be able to find these numbers um anyways i think i wish mariah carey well you know god bless her i think if she wants it she dreams it she manifests it hopefully she can achieve it i think you mean you wish the queen of christmas well exactly wow and just like that ryland adams bows out of the race it s between me and mariah now watch your back A A um are you ready i m ready wendy williams not seriously considered to join talk show for the last episode for the last episode so you didn t read this article either no i honestly misunderstood it i had chills reading the article that this headline came out of the hollywood reporter shining on her today and i feel like you need to know how much i appreciate well this was something i did outside of the sip this was a personal read for myself because i have been intensely following along the timeline of wendy williams and what s been going on with her because i do i found so while i know what she did was like sometimes uh not the most moral thing to do like talking smack on celebrities which like i can be called guilty of as well do you remember when she was she was like announcing like she was introducing a story she s like this guy on tiktok has this many more followers than me than me can you believe it way more than me way more than i ve ever had way more than i could ever have a brooklyn accent i don t care if she s in new york then everyone in the audience is like no like they re all on her side like A A that guy who has more followers than you and then she goes anyways he s dead shot and killed like that s not funny that s not the funny part and i i mean my heart goes out to her because she s not well i don t know what i mean even the producers of the show don t know but the hollywood reporter did this big long piece on the timeline of wendy and how um the demise of her show came to fruition yeah sorry it really is sad she was she was like an innovator in the daytime space she changed it up she could talk and hold her own show by herself it was always entertaining she could riff like i mean it s a talent of all talents to honestly be able to entertain somebody with your mouth alone by yourself you know what i get that sounds a lot like A A work Laughter and i do hear it i do hear it but i have a special place in my heart for wendy williams and i m just like wishing her a man who also does a lot of mouth entertaining and no they because uh sherry shepard was hosting the show on the final day of the show and sherry is replacing her time slot taking the majority of wendy s team with her which i understand business is business and the stations held out as long as they could with running reruns or repeats with guests of the show but they did not even consider wendy to come back to her show for the last day which is heartbreaking but they thought it would cause well it s live right i have a commotion yeah that s a big risk man it s a and it s a really good read if you go to the hollywood reporter and read that article i just wouldn t know so what s this about somebody i don t know the wednesday adams show on netflix is coming out oh with jenny ortega yeah and catherine zeta jones is playing uh the mom morticia is it already out no oh sorry i don t know i mean i m so excited for it it s like a tim burton imagined thing so i feel like there s no way it s gon na suck as much ass as the sabrina one did the trailer is visually stunning yeah and jenny that girl just can t quit getting jobs she s so great she s so good i like her a lot i know for being a part of the addams family myself i know nothing about the adams family no nothing about the story never seen any of the content do you know the song the adams family or what is it it s close enough yeah there you go okay yeah just wondering anyways i m very excited about that um i thought i could end on like a pissed off note oh you did why because i m pissed off for chris pratt why it s very unpopular like in hollywood oh wait why are you doing this stanford yeah what did go ahead defend chris pratt to stand for chris pratt i mean you know what i m gon na stand here with you in solidarity i don t think chris pratt is that bad of a guy i think the news media has really cycled him in a way that s A A up i think he might be simple and saying simple things without thinking about the deeper complex meanings that everyone s throwing at it it s very it s been very much his the narrative of his character has been painted for him yeah he has come out himself saying he doesn t participate in a church that is anti gay the church he goes to is a church that welcomes everyone and he has like come out against a lot of these things but none of the outlets that spread the uh horrific news about him pick up those bits they continue on with the negative news and i think where it hit ahead for me is recently his co star of jurassic world came out is it jessica chastain no it s bryce dallas howard she came out and was talking about the pay discrepancy between her and the men in the franchise because she had worked on it before chris pratt had entered it and i guess chris pratt went to bat for her to get equal pay for the two of them she got paid million he got paid million and she was like he fought for me as hard as he could and i did get paid more than i ever have previously on the franchise with him and every headline about it you would have thought it was he gave him negative about him and i just thought it s interesting how the media can take something even that s positive and have a negative connotation where the person that had brought this article or this story to my attention had spread it negatively to me and i said i want to go get the details on this so i clicked on the article and i said did you read the article and they said no and i said actually he fought for her to have the same pay as her yeah and he goes oh that s crazy and then i googled his name and all the headlines were in the same negative connotation right and as a person who this episode is guilty of not reading any any of the articles typically i don t just base my opinions off of the headlines alone because they are salacious and there was a point in time when the news and the media their sole journalistic integrity was based upon giving you the facts and now it feels as if so much of the news has a personal opinion spin in it that it s you have to read the entire article to come to your own conclusion on the facts and you also have to root through a lot of like the bias yeah no matter what and that is i understand how we evolved to here yeah but i also think it s very damaging in that now there s people walking around the world talking down about a person yeah in regards to something they didn t actually read about but that s how the characteristic of a person gets built and then if chris says anything then even more people pick it up so he s damned if he does he s damned if he doesn t and so then i was talking to the person they re like well i said well what would make you think he s not a bad person they re like if he came out and said i m not gay and he said i said well he did as much as he er not i m not and i m not uh i m not homophobic and i said well he basically did that saying he s not involved with the church that doesn t hate the gay people which is where the rumor initially spun from and he was like well i don t know i don t even know how it could like be redeemed then and i just hate how the media is able to create a persona of a person that isn t a reality but is factual for a lot of people and that s why i believe it is so important for individuals to do critical thinking like you can not just continue to plug your nose and take the medicine that s being spoon fed to you you have to actually ask questions yeah and do your deep dive but i think a lot of these things are somewhat trivial for other people gossiping this is trivial this is trivial because it s we re talking about celebrity gossip but it s not a trivial concept and it s not isolated to chris pratt it s something that happens on a big grand scale so i think this is a really easy thing for us to talk about with like that bigger topic at play because it s not really actually offensive i mean to a lot of people he is offensive they won t go see the movies that chris is in and it is damaging in that way like no that s definitely it s not trivial to his to chris pratt s existence that s not what i mean i just mean the grand scheme of conversations we re not talking about something that s more harmful oh of course like in politics this is the game yeah and in politics this conversation even having this conversation is unacceptable and i think that that s a really big problem because i like love the socratic seminar method you know what i mean like everybody has an open discussion where all opinions are on the floor and stated and not even just opinions but it s like facts about matters and then socratically we come we boil it all down and we find like quote unquote the absolute truth but that s not possible anymore because if you start saying things like this you get labeled as a specific type of person when maybe you re not but you are a type of person who looks deeper into things and it s not that you re defend you re defending the devil it s that you re defending critical thinking and coming to your own conclusions yeah so i think it s really great that you brought it up i also love chris parra and i loved that navy seal movie he did it hits according to me because i feel like in the height of canceled culture it is what was happening out like i m not saying anything that i m not saying like everyone that got canceled wasn t canceled for a reason but i do feel like once you re on a train of of clicks it s like a free for all anyone s allowed to create a character outside of that person that isn t actually the reality of what was going on yeah and then all of a sudden these things that aren t true about you but they re like uh deductions or conclusions that were made in in just to hurt you are now facts on your wikipedia page and that s A A i know are you talking about i m like i ve never looked at my wikipedia no i don t know i m not talking about anyone specifically i m speaking i just feel like every day i open my news app it s like another chris pratt headline and i m like i don t know everything he s ever done in his life obviously but it s just like give the man a A A break yeah you have a wikipedia page i don t know i but i felt like what you were talking about was directed at me like you had searched it and known that there was false no but like now all i want to do is make sure we both have a wikipedia page and if you don t have a wikipedia page i mean if i don t have a wikipedia page and you do like i m not i m not going to be like weird around you but i m going to hurt it s going to hurt all right well we ll go check it out maybe we ll read our wikipedia pages together if i even A A have should we just check no this is next step ugh give them something to come back for thank you guys so much for watching can we tell them i was recognized i think this is a good story for next week it s a good top of show i ll sit on it okay all right you guys thank you so much for watching and enjoying our podcast uh i know it s produced so perfectly with the black screen in the middle or maybe i also just realized have i been

zip should they see my beautiful baby yeah show her Music you
Music thank you Applause Music thank you because he has this weird obsession with Lele pons wedding I mean it looks like a A A star started Affair bro Steve Aoki was there and sometimes they play Steve Aoki at Orangetheory Fitness and I A A hate it it s like Steve AOK doesn t actually work out so all the Beats he s made are not for somebody who s like really pushing it you know what I m saying how rude do I have boogers I don t know I was hoping that I don t have boogers uh I was really trying to stay positive today you know you got ta mute him while he puts his hat on okay here we go I was really trying to be positive today I was like I m not gon na bring any negative energy to the podcast because it s been negative for too long and we just need to be positive girls and of course everything A A goes wrong yeah your back s broken your belt s too tight this motherfucker s hips are shaken from the left to the right wait what no I m just kidding I don t know about your hips but I do know that your back is broken the one picture you had sent me of Lele pons wedding I you were just like showing me her tan lines but I thought that was awesome no no no no no no I sent a picture of Lele pons during the father daughter dance to Ryland and he misunderstood and thought that her father was her husband I said wait did she marry a year old that s definitely her dad but this wedding looks A A off the A A chains Paris Hilton was a bridesmaid a bridesmaid yeah Tana was in attendance wow yeah well connected woman wild I can t believe people want to have weddings and go to them all right well I gather myself well first of all hello you guys hello you guys and welcome to another episode of the Sip he s Ryland Adams and I am Lizzie Gordon hello hello that is us and welcome back um what s going on with your back brow did you not go to the chiropractor this morning everyone s probably sick of it by now I need to know what s going on well you know what I have an intercostal tear sexy an intercom I guess between like your I don t know anything about it but there s like all these little X s around like your ribs and one of those muscles or I don t know if it s a muscle it tore and I was like so like what does that mean he was like trying to explain it to me but I don t really understand and I think before I actually knew what it was I did like the fast Chiropractic which is like we don t need to name names yeah but we have but I was just like oh let me just go get adjusted the problem with that is they just do their standard like crack crack yeah see you later where it s like I needed somebody to actually evaluate what was wrong with me before like going in and potentially making what was bad worse yeah and so I really did a lot of research and I found a chiropractor that like seemed super legit and has a lot of other things and options other than just like I m gon na crack you out of this world and it was really a wonderful experience because he like found exactly and targeted the area and then he put all these machines on my body that like and it gets the uh blood circulating into that area because I guess it s like it s hard for your blood flow to get there blah blah blah blah and then he does like a laser and then he like tapes me up and does all this tape right now yeah like a real athlete can I see I mean you want to see my yeah I want to see your tape wow there she is cool it s blue I m taped up ladies no but this oh like the last time that he I don t know what this machine s called but it really I it does like a figure eight and it really is like and then you re like oh yeah but the day I did really good in the description I was kind of sore and less mobile that day as well but then the days after that I was like better than I was previously beautiful um and yesterday like I saw you and we hung out and I was like I was pretty good um I mean you re still like doing a full blown squat to get down oh yeah I can t bend over you can t bend over at all it s like it s like he rises and like Falls but he can not bend and we re going on about two weeks two weeks yeah you re all flying out and it s like I can t work out which you and I both know working out for us is like as much as physical yeah I would say it s more mental for us it s like the release we got ta exhaust the crazy exactly that s the crazy A A that just runs circles in our head all day we got ta tire that A A out so that we can have a A A functional life and so I ve been trying to find ways to have functional life without working out and I m just like trying to be like there was a purpose for this I needed to slow it down too fast everything I just can t find some reason why God would punish me like this of all people I m a good man and normally I m going through like my what the photos I ve taken for the week to spark any stories to share on the podcast I was going through I m like nothing it s just a miserable week oh boy but we re fine everything s turning around that shirt smells used um yeah it was from uh the Melrose Trading Post so like definitely just came off the back of somebody else but that adds up and checks out well I do all consignment stores and things like this smell the same like is it like the chemicals to kill the lice it must be because it s like a gnarly A A like that s used but why do they all smell the same like have you noticed every I don t know what Consignments to Kill the Lights I m telling you so they re all using the same spray I mean why why fix something that ain t Brown this has even gone through the wash though and it s still reeking like one of those stores so we ve just got to throw it away after this conspiracy Corner let s figure it out send it back we want answers the people want answers how are you you know I m okay really yeah you walked in the door like everything s always wrong when Lizzy storms you are like a tornado of kids I am nothing if not a tornado of well ordered hard work meets perseverance and positivity that s me too Laughter Music um no honestly I m okay wow I feel like I have some bots in my cave and we re just gon na have to deal with that look up okay okay so I m okay yesterday I am I m still dealing with the loss of my wallet I think my one of my cards was sent to my old house which is obnoxious because I paid out the ass to have like my mail forwarded and it never is and I changed my address with the bank but here we are and I still don t have a driver s license and we ll just keep waiting on that um but this weekend I went to replace my Costco card and I was like oh I ll get there right when it opens at a m hit the ground running get that A A get in get out get ahead is that not senior hour well it s not any hour apparently at Costco on a Sunday because it opens at am and there were already A A lined up and I was there honestly I missed the nine o clock opening time I got there at like and I was like whatever it won t be that bad A A were already lined up minutes before Costco opened why would you do that on a weekend you should have gone today after the podcast no I go that no my weeks are for work I do my business my life business on the weekends yeah but Costco on a weekend I know it s a A A nightmare every single time but no matter what I m in and out within an hour somebody with rage problems I actually don t have rage at Costco what that is something that makes me rageful I know Costco is my happy place it s like the kind of chaos I thrive in and usually I m not that mad but this morning first of all why show up minutes before Costco opens to beat the line to wait minutes minutes does that not seem A A crazy to you bat A A crazy that seems real wack is Bonkers to me so like the Logics off there and then the other thing is I get in and I didn t know that they were gon na force me to take another picture and I had my hair slicked down the center and like down the sides because it s A A filthy it s like slicked with filth into like a tiny bun in the back of my head and no makeup on and they re like all right we got ta take your picture down it s like oh A A and I do it and it s just so A A Overexposed that I look like I m full blown like balding like my dad no offense Chris I love you but like bro you have no hair does he need to get unfiness right it s too late for him oh wow but oh you saw the picture it s bad I look like I just got it s like my mug shot after murdering yeah I was like what happened like did you and Joe get into it this morning yeah no it was not a good move it was uh it is what it is it s who I am now it s how Costco identifies I would have just let it expire you know what I did let mine expire I love it in the first place was because Morgan got it and added me to her family plan and then I was like I can t go to Costco I have no business going to Costco getting a cart like that are you A A kidding me well as a as a person who s like enraged by the prices of groceries there are there s a lot of positive sides to getting A A from Costco especially like even even though we re just a family of two getting paper towels there getting toilet paper there it s I bought eight rolls of toilet paper at Ralph s while I couldn t find my Costco card guess how much that A A cost twenty five dollars what are you A A high no way no way Jose it was A A up and I m sick of it paper towels are crazy they re A A crazy toilet paper yeah but not at Costco at Costco it s affordable I get like rolls at Costco for she goes so out of her way to save on groceries that she is lying to her husband oh yeah well he doesn t listen A A tell Joe call your son you kick your A A mouth shut Marge don t ruin this for me Joe is a hater on Trader Joe s Joe hates Trader Joe s and he will not allow his wife to shop there for him no he s like the A A rotten food the meat s rotten it s all rotten is there a reason I just told you he thinks it s all rotten I know why what is his I don t know I don t know his base for like most things I just go okay honey like okay yeah uh huh you re right pick up Lizzy yesterday and she s like I ll be damned if I spend two dollars on a A A tomato it wraps one more time no but honestly I will be God A A damned if I spend two dollars on more time did I already say this on the podcast I don t know tomatoes are what we used to throw at people at theater when it sucked and now they re two dollars a A A piece are you joking I m enraged I m enraged and my lemon tree isn t producing like it once was no it s not and everyone s noticed so yeah no I m going to Trader Joe s I m going to Trader Joe s and I realized after I bought soy sauce there that it s Mark s Trader Joe s and I was like don t take a sharpie to it or do I just Bank on the fact that I know he can t read yeah I was like everything is very like Trader Joe s Brandon she s like oh no before he comes into the kitchen I discard of all the time I do because God damn him dude he s and he always act like I don t go grocery shopping like A A Sunday that s why I m so enraged about the cost of tomatoes and potatoes and how about your wild budget for food for the week I m not saying like the price points wild I m saying like Lizzie s like I can only spend x amount on groceries a week and I can only spend dollars eating out a week and I was like why did you come to the conclusion of have to do with it I couldn t tell you but it seems right you probably spent more than that just yesterday on our record I did that was what well I fed three people with I told you I was gon na pay and then you went wild and I know but that s what happens when you have a husband at home who needs two A A tacos even though he s heating up a plate of the food you made for him last night and not telling you it s in the oven so when you go to shoot your Vlog and meal prep for the week you re burning something at degrees for minutes to the oven that you didn t know was there husbands are A A great they re awesome oh wow they totally freak me out I mean right on they take care of us like yeah they do Joe s behind the camera with a A A machete yeah at least takes care of him no that motherfucker s been on a roll lately he cleaned the entire house and actually scrubbed the the A A stove top which is unbelievable unbelievable behavior on his part then I go to sleep and I wake up the next morning my laundry is folded and on the dresser that s wild it is wild I was like does he know how to fold didn t know honestly been with the man almost years had no A A clue this A A knew how to fold a gun I like to roll my towels and keep them on the side of my bathtub he d rolled my bath my towels and put them on the side of the bathtub that s worth swallowing over I don t think I could do that without regarding but it was like so sweet it was really sweet he went he went above and beyond and so what I ve learned is you can t be passive aggressive in your thankfulness you just have to be straight up thankful yeah you got ta reward the puppy so that they ll have the same behavior again absolutely instead of like calling out the behavior as awkward or weird or like yeah I m so out of place thanks a lot yeah because then they re like I m not gon na do that again exactly I just get chastised for being nice yeah so I mean I m not all I like when I see something I just get on I m gon na give him a bunch of kisses and I say I love you so much my sweet boy and he goes thank you we have to train our men like we train our puppies it was really sweet though because the other morning he woke up and he was like my baby and he was talking about me wow that s never happened no honestly and it s so funny because he s like I m like this all the time it s like are you if we re taking a look in the mirror and being real A A honest with ourselves about how we are all the time are you like well how are you are you greeting him with Grace every day no does he walk out of his way honest for you like I have started doing this sort of like this affirmation thing where I go I love my husband who s my team player and everything is gon na be okay say it back say it back I use it when I used to have a job out of the house yeah I would get home from like a long day and Shane would shake like a dog shakes when they re excited that s so cute he hasn t done it in a while

code Ryland for off your first order with doordash speaking of training our dogs yeah I signed icky up for puppy classes and was up this one s ass to get Riley in there and he goes no I m too narcissistic to train my dog oh please he says no I can t do that I need Riley to be an extension of my narcissism and training would really get in the way of that this is all Lizzy projecting because I was like well I d have to really look into the class description because believe it or not my princess Riley has had eight sessions of training well no matter what it s for puppies so the only requirement is being under months old well I know but I don t okay here s my issue I don t think there s any regression in her trading you know what I mean like I don t think it would hurt her to relearn the basics because if she never had Riley needs to be socialized and she needs to be worked on her training around other people because when there s nobody at our house she does obey her commands and she s a good dog my issue that s why I suggested bringing her to a class where there are other people and other dogs I know but I don t want to confuse her if the curriculum s like the Sit Stay Down place because it s like I ve already implemented one trainer s way about doing that right so if a new trainer starts doing a new one then she s confused and she doesn t know what to say because I was learning like when I was first training Riley I was like well I ve trained two other dogs but I don t know the process of like what comes first and how to make the dogs understand so that you re not just like yelling at them like you need them to understand you before you can like implement the command because I can t just say sit if she doesn t know what sit means got it um so what do you say now when you want her to sit rest okay so that s it it is but there s like mechanics to how you and that s what I didn t know the thing is when life got so busy and we landed here I haven t implemented any of that so I just need to get strict when people are walking in and then yes I do need to socialize her right so I ll look at the curriculum let s go when s it starting for uh the second of April Sundays a m the nd of April you re not doing that for a month it was the only time I could do I can t do during the week because you re working because I m a working girl she s busy she s blessed and busy so you re just gon na deal with pee on your floor until then yep no I m trying something else for him so I know that he does tell me when he needs to go out so I take him out when he needs to go out and I m gon na also take him out when he doesn t need to go out and I m not gon na let him back in until he pees outside he s also started doing this really funny thing where because he pees like a girl and he never lifts a leg when bubs is out in the wild he ll lift a leg but when he s at home he pees like a girl it s all for show it s all for show but icky just pees like a girl and he ll pee like this in public but at home sometimes he fully it s like he s doing a sun salutation and so his legs are flush with the A A floor so he s just pissing on his own tummy and legs and then this morning it s like he took a knee like he had one leg up and one leg fully down and just pissed like that and I was like what is going on somebody like this spot s good you re just watching him pee on your rug yeah no outside oh okay let s pee on the outside rug too though which is a A A Laughter I love him so much he s eating the window in the front of the house so on the way here I decided like I m probably gon na break up our uh sectional and put one fully against the window no they ll never have how are they gon na know how are they gon na how are they gon na know how would they ever know who s gon na tell them publicly he s all A A killing I know back when there was a rat infestation we lived in Studio City in the Hills because you re on the hill and the trees are over the house like the rats can crawl up the trees and just like down into your house bro and so we re like so you sold a house full of rice you were like going to sell the house and I had like talked about the rat infestation all over YouTube in the real estate agents like hey next time you re trying to sell a house I don t think you should be like publicizing that it s infested with rats you re a maniac no I mean it was included it s just not like the best look to be like this has his rats everywhere we re playing it the Harris uh the what s the A A Indiana Jones the third one of the original ones that were done by Steven Spielberg uh that Last Crusade Crusade yeah the Last Crusade the one with River you and Chris conversation the run with River Phoenix anyway that s you know okay Dr Jones senior is terrified of rats and they re in these catacombs and it s just like a A A ton of rats like falling through the ceiling and they re like real ass rats and Joe and I are like how do they yuck like I couldn t be in a movie where they like said we re gon na put a real rat on your hair and it s gon na nibble on you and hold on to you yes and some people are like no rats are good they re so smart they re so clean they re really good animals and it s like I get it but they re A A Vermin bro and and the rat that they found in the catacomb probably not as sweet as your house rat you know what I m saying like you re a little buddy it s different it s a different kind of rat it s different wait violin have you not seen the Indiana Jones movies no oh but did you not like it no I like the rides at Disneyland okay I ve been on it at Disneyland I haven t been seen to the movie whoa you might like the movie I don t know you might like it um okay so Lizzy takes me to lunch yesterday she drags me to lunch and I dragged him nowhere I said do you want to go for a hike he said yes I said I don t have time for lunch I wanted you I said I do not have time for lunch and he said well then A A you I wanted to hike according to the Sun and you were like ain t busy it s a week I m busy yeah which thank you I finished my Vlog because she said no to me you re welcome and so we went yesterday which you didn t even remember I had to remind you and you re like oh okay also I think I had said Saturday no you said oh my gosh I m not going through our text because everyone hates when we do that because it takes too long I would like to know and they think I don t know how to search for text messages but they don t realize that you and I text so much and all words are keywords no words are off limits on their texts I don t know what you mean by that I don t know it just felt like a good thing to say okay um anyways she takes me to this taco restaurant that s like popping it s like a new place it s all Tacos yeah and there s a line all the way out the building and she s like just run in there and grab a seat I was like you can t do that when there s a line out the building it feels illegal to go in and take a seat right you re not setting it up right it s a place where you order fast casual A A people understand what that is no they don t yes they do no yes that s rich people Chris what do you think fast fast casual what do you presume that means I m gon na be honest I don t know are you kidding me nobody A A says fast casual and it means something to them so fast casual as Rylan has put it means that you go up to a counter and place your own order at the register you get a number let me A A play it out okay fine you pay at the register you get a number you sit down at a table and they serve you this place was A A packed and super A A busy and I said Rylan tell me what you want I ll order you go find us a table and he starts acting like that is illegal because there s all these other people in line that are going to have their food ready first without a table because me I jumped the line and sat down so those people now are going to be having their food you know what I m gon na let the comment section Tear Me Apart like they did when I joined Chris in the security line because they re A A Psychopaths but I m right about this everybody A A does it it s not an A A move it s honestly not illegal I just you weren t the one sitting at the table and I have like no number and I m just by myself like what and then we sit down and because we re so hungry we just went on a long hike every time the girl goes by with food Lizzy like with conviction looks dead in her eyes and goes oh that one s ours no I was asking I said is that for us I did I said is that for us look I think that one s ours no I said that s bro oh I said that s for us but it was like a question sure it was but she like was looking at her number and she s like I don t I don t think she care about she s like this is for you and I was like Yay Chris who are you texting I I m just searching something oh what are you searching What fast casual restaurants are oh fair enough did you find anything it s a lot Chipotle well I guess Chipotle wouldn t even be one it s like the ones that you get a number right you said Chipotle and I want to A A be puke okay oh I wanted to what I m sorry I love Chipotle that was not worth saying out loud I just love Chipotle I m sorry oh yeah me too um so I wanted to Circle back to your what s going on oh sorry I thought it was an amber alert I wanted to check and make sure there weren t lives that I could save uh we d never delve into that you like are doing live improv shows in front of an audience oh you want to talk about that yeah I don t think there s much more to say beyond that that s crazy is it oh that s wild is it yeah I don t think I would get up in front of an audience with nothing I mean that s what we do every Monday feels like just Chris is here though I don t know this makes me a lot more stressed out what do you guys like what s it like how do you conduct an improv scene like if we were on stage and everyone that s watching is our live audience yeah what would you and I do right now um well the way that I do it with this group the turbine Collective the turbine way is we do we start in an emotional place with a strong feeling about the person that s opposite us okay so whatever you chose emotionally I would then choose to be the the reason for it and my response to you is based on knowing that I m the fact that you re in this emotional state okay go no see it s crazy that s crazy how would I know if it s good if I m entertained it s I m entertained as an audience member you re a good improver well no so again like this group that I work with we so we do that we come from an emotional place we put it on our partner and take it off of ourselves and we re not necessarily trying to be funny but we are trying to have what we call a c and react and change response so through we know a scene has finished if we re at a different part if one or both of us are at a different part than where we started that s polar opposite to how we started so if I come into a scene hysterically laughing we would know the scene was over if I was sobbing by the end of it as a result of something you did so is it like a word or is it an emotion that you start with we don t do it uh we don t do words we just do like a scene um we start with sort of like a stage setting so we decide we come on very emotional and then we set a picture on the stage with our bodies so I it s like we wouldn t just be sitting casually like this like one of us would be like very sincere give me a setup give me a setup I am let s execute no we can t execute let s just try I don t want to I want to improv no this is so cringy well if you want to improvise or come on the open workshop on Monday night it s pretty cringy to watch improv shows too unless they re really good right yeah so don t a lot of them have like weird gimmicks a lot of them have weird gimmicks there s no no gimmicks at this one though it s literally just okay let s improv we can t improv just we can t yes we can Chris give us a subject no you you the emotions Chris okay it s like it s like a big you re always upset because his back hurts I m not playing you re such a loser no I do this thing where it s like if I don t feel supported by my partner I ll be like I m gon na kill myself and I have no problem A A offing myself in a scene and just laying there dead until it s over drag me off A A I m not playing your sick games I can t believe you won t improv with me no because you re me it s like a whole physical thing I can t do it just sitting beside you I think you stretch your imagination sis there are other classes that focus on being witty and funny with your words and this is not one of them so I can t just you re so important I just wanted to play with you I wanted to do something different than what we always do and you won t play with me it s not fun it s awful it s literally cringe as A A it makes me sick the suggestion makes me A A sick all right Chris swap please yeah let s do it guys let s watch Rylan and Chris sit here and improvise a scene with a suggestion from me and no one here in the room okay what would your thing be what would you see what my word just for us oh I just almost uh said a word I m not allowed to say it was the f word it was the f word there were a lot of F words in Lizzie s neighborhood yesterday I was like wow this neighborhood full of F words oh yeah let s be clear you re the one that was full of that for it I m allowed to say the f word because am I not allowed to say the f word you re allowed to say the f word but there s good speculation that I m saying the f word without being allowed to so I wanted to be clear that you were the one who was throwing out f bombs while we were driving through my neighborhood and not me right I m always the nasty one just like throwing at her way like there s like a straight couple and I m like those F words a lot of if you were just two men walking with two separate dogs and it felt like it was clear that these two men were of different households and like rylan s like look at those f bombs and I was like how do you know they re f bombs he s like well you could just tell he s like I I don t think that you can just tell okay what would you give Chris and I uh we could do it from across I would give you and Chris a revolver with one bullet no that s too nasty guns are very polarizing I would give you and Chris uh one regular Coke and one Coke with poison in it and you both have to take a drink oh of two different cups oh a piece of licorice that you both have to eat the entirety of how do you make it happen oh so it is just physical you just do it you just pretend I think I hate him no this is the dumbest A A thing okay we re moving on to Hot Topics wait why are we moving on to Hot Topics there s more things to discuss like what oh you bitched about your back for five hours I didn t even want to bring that to the podcast I m a meal prep girl now you didn t want to talk about that boring you re already over it I m sure meal prepping sucks say what today was day one of my meal prep and I m like I m A A starving that A A I for the Vlog I ve meal prepped my breakfast for the week and I m oh I hate it for the week to be fair like and I have it for the week yeah that s it Joe ate like three last night though so I don t even have it for the full week I pulled out my meal prep this morning and opened it I was like oh someone had a lot of these every time I want to save food like if I were to get Chipotle for example cut it in half I m like oh I m gon na put it in the fridge because Chipotle is better after it s cold I m gon na eat that for lunch I m like wait to the

discuss it because I feel like it s insane it s so stupid I think so as everyone who s on the Internet is aware Haley Bieber and Selena Gomez are allegedly fighting well this the thing that s it our the internet it has created from scratch as though they were God a massive insult from Haley slung it Selena and this is how bored we are as a community of the internet as a whole right what the the crazy thing to me is how to the tunes of millions of people are deeply upset on behalf of Selena for a a an insult that doesn t exist so they re on Celine aside yeah so then why is Selena acting like woe is me right now I mean I don t know how she s acting I don t really care to speculate on how either of them are acting I just think it s A A batshit crazy that of nothing the internet has forged that Haley is this bad person and then if you think about it millions of people now are dragging Haley through the mud in a way that is like very aggressive I have a hot tip for all of them just shut off your A A phones for a couple of times yeah and just and if you don t shut off your phones you have your notifications off for everything and just don t A A look I mean also people on the internet how about just chill how about just it don t do that because also they were so the the whole thing started because a picture of Selena went viral of her in the water looking thicker than she usually looks and then immediately after that happened or not even immediately after that happened but like within the same year of that picture coming up A A Haley posted this thing with her and Kendall and Kylie or someone or whatever and it s that Viral uh God s timing is a host yeah God s time and then everyone decided to say she posted that because Selena s fat but really aren t you just calling Selena fat for saying that because nobody A A did that that s a bridge you built of bricks you brought from home and that s pretty A A nasty and that s Tick Tock and that s well no it s not just Tick Tock it s A A it s the I know but that s how it spreads right and it but that s how bad idea spreads how how A A mentally broken are you people that you grab onto that well and build an entire universe of hatred and Loathing for this person because you think that this one thing that was really just you being an A A for calling someone who s bigger than they once were fat in your own mind and guess what everyone they re probably both A A and they re probably both not A A like we both have our days everyone has our days absolutely they re both weirdos the one thing I do love about this though is it s also spurred a bunch of like resurfacing videos of Haley full blown fangirling over Justin for years waiting outside his hotel room waiting outside shows like being on red carpets with her dad and the second she sees Justin she like sprinkles over like hella fast she s manifested her husband oh yeah I get to talk to her doing that A A I would let s do it who do we have to stock to get a talk shot stand outside of CBS I ll go with you I one time tried just waiting outside Warner Brothers with head shots and just throwing them around and nobody gave a A A I have footage of that if you d like maybe if we were more persistent then it would have worked oh my God we should be hella persistent you think we should just like do our like instead of like doing hot girl walks at Fryman Canyon we should do them around the studio no no no here s what we should do we need to victim ours I we need to make it seem like CBS victimized us and then they owe us one I can t play into that I I will start a tick tock purely dedicated to CBS victimizing Rylan Adams and Lizzie Gordon listen up and I will not A A rest until we have a talk show you said the A A for Lizzie and Ryland I fell down a long dark hole of watching old clips of Wendy Williams last night and I was just like well because I m watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta I ve never seen it before and I just wanted some like context of them outside of the show in an interview element and like Wendy does it best you know she can like say whatever she wants to guess and like she can like hit him with the hardcore I just ugh I just love a good talk show and I feel like there aren t many that are existing anymore right so get me Josh Peck we ll let s make this into a A A talk show Bring me Josh back bring him to me bring him to me Chris go get Josh oh okay go get Josh you better be texting Josh Chris I just I ve seen a lot of like the news headlines showing like Selena commenting on tick tocks made about Selena so her for you page must just be like people talking about her and I think like Selena you just got ta shut down Tick Tock yeah just like you re so successful she did she s in Texas right now fishing posting about it I mean I don t know if she s posting about it but like girl just put down your phone for a month if you don t need it to like she s like her career is not dependent on a social media presence like you have a lot of great acting jobs you have a great music career if you want to go back to that you have a beauty line that s killing it like you don t need to be posting even once a month if you don t want to be no so just chill it out for your mental health girly yeah you told her how does Haley feel I don t know about being on Haley s room oh just everybody A A hates Haley Haley lost like a million followers whatever Haley I ll still hang out with you if you need a friend yeah and it s like in August we all were A A killing ourselves to get glazed donut Nails because Haley Bieber did and now we re like A A that A A I don t know it feels bad I m not quite like that no you ve always been team Haley I mean I do love anyone because we don t know any of the story or what s going on behind well that s the thing I don t think there is a story that s what s driving me the most that s what was crazy is when everyone was talking about this I tried to watch a video that somebody had compiled all the information yeah and even somebody like putting it together with a nice bow on top I still couldn t find a way to care about it I because there s nothing to care about exactly and the CR well the even more wild thing is like you know like I troll drama channels and I watch them like while I m eating or showering or whatever they ve been updating every day on this drama as if there is a drama as if either of these women are contributing they create drama so that they can Garner their attention for themselves nobody that the drama is about is participating or creating new things uh Selena s commenting in comment sections she is but she commented on Kylie s like this is crazy this is being blown on proportion right like and then she was like I m gon na take a break and then she popped back in like the next day I m like girl just put your phone down I just I don t know I don t think the responsibility is on anyone involved in this or anyone and when I say involved I mean anyone victimized by the internet in this right it s wild it s wild it s wild it s a crazy place to be it s a crazy you know it s been so nice what is muting everyone who s ever like talked about me I don t see it yeah not having notifications for anything not having Twitter not looking at Tick Tock it s a great place to be like I could be so canceled right now and I d have no idea I d tell you um you know what I was thinking about for a week not having my phone on my body in my house oh like having a place where I put my phone and I check it like every three hours yeah break the Habit because I m worried about my back or just set boundaries for yourself I look up when you re looking at your phone not hunched down yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I could do that all right you didn t but I did what saw the Chris Rock well I tried this is so A A annoying Netflix let me preface it Chris Rock did a special for Netflix that premiered live like while he was while they were recording it they aired it on Netflix and now it just lives there rent free except it doesn t live there rent free because I had to work for minutes to try to watch this A A special because I didn t tune in live yeah I tried last night to watch it and then it was like you have to update your Netflix app to be able to watch this special so I updated that didn t work then I d update my Apple TV didn t work then I got into it and it kept giving me error codes and then when I finally got in it I couldn t scroll like anywhere inside of the video so Netflix you need to get your A A together like we re way too far into Netflix for you to not be able to execute baby I think that s a you problem it s a Netflix I mean I was watching I had no problem with it and I m Netflix Lee challenge you know what I mean so it really does feel a little bit like maybe so I did make it minutes in after spending minutes but the camera work with his motions were making me a little motion sick oh really I was like I just listened to it I didn t physically watch I m gon na have to finish by listening um I actually was listening to it on my way to Costco that morning and then when it ended the next thing in my queue was that awful Show sex life which I ve never seen an episode isn t that what Kim Kardashians I was talking about yeah again I ve never seen an episode of it but it s like it opens with like softcore porn and so I have what was a comedy special blasting in my car with the windows down and then all of a sudden it s like oh no Tucker he goes doesn t sound like you mean no and she s like and there s just a A A line of year old A A couples in line at Costco before it even opens so that was my experience with the yeah Netflix used to get their A A together um but what I found to be I don t I don t like talking negatively about stand up comedians because I think that it s uh other people do that enough for me right and I don t want to find problems where there aren t any but I am particularly tired of these male Comics utilize boiling women s utility down to our youth Beauty and A A because it is A A wrong and quite frankly like what portion are you like what was the topic he talks about how every dime he s ever made he s spent on A A and in one way or another paying off women s college student loans like and the reason why he dates women who are well under his age is because their financial needs are lesser than an older woman s financial needs and it s like it s not just Chris Rock it s a lot of men a lot of men do this a lot of men talk about like I don t think that s much to brag about them well that s the point for somebody I mean take a boy girl out of it yeah you would have to pay me to A A you to be completely honest you would have to A A pay me to sit through your insufferable ego absolutely and it s like you know I and to some degree there are funny observations to be made and there are jokes that I laugh at in regards to that but it s like I need it to be nuanced and I need it to be new because that s a dead A A horse A A it s like I can t I can t do it anymore and then when it came oh sorry I don t know I was gon na say what were his other poignant points I would not use the word poignant in regards to any of the points when I don t even know if you had points that were being made to be honest the one thing that did make me laugh is about how his wife is his ex wife is just as rich as him and the thing that did make me laugh and he s like and she s not even funny because he made his money being funny but you know who is how s she Rich because they got a divorce right she got half of his money wow and good for her because she suffered through your cheating and A A her entire A A adult life you can t Laughter um I didn t know you hated him so I didn t I didn t hate him I A A really like Chris Rock and then I watched the special and I m just like I got a bad A A taste in my mouth for these A A dudes who have all these playing points about how they pay for women s lives and it s just like I mean I don t think that s great on any regard like if I was a gay man doing that to another guy I would also like I d feel like well I have to pay for somebody to like me like that yeah like yeah you guys are A A insufferable you ever think about telling that joke that you re so goddamn A A inside of dollars while loathing and anger in order to get a woman to find you attractive enough to sleep with you and then you cheat on the person who decides to stay with you even though you re all of those horrible things I haven t seen it yet that s so funny I m going to see it I m like I m mad about it and I like I m like I m like annoyingly mad about it did Joe watch it with you no I listened to it all right while he was sleeping but you know it s it it definitely bugs me I think there are gender Norms that can be funny when you know exploited in it from a nuanced point of view but I m A A tired of this I m tired of it yeah and I mean I m sure it s gon na offend like that s part of their job is like trying to do like that s a road he wanted to go down yeah like tear the line on being offensive I guess in I don t even getting the laugh or something yeah and it s not even that I find it offensive I m just A A tired of it but don t you think that reports or that reflects just as poorly on him like and his like I don t know that I d want to advertise that I have to pay for somebody to like me yeah but I I do think that they re not that my opinion or review on Comedy makes it funny or not I m sure some people found that funny and that s fine I m just I as a as a as an audience member really I find self deprecation to be a lot more funny than uh a petty observation of another person especially if it s not a nuanced unique point of view right and I think it would have been a lot more I think that uh humor s a lot more funny when it s when it s personal to a person but they can they can convey it in a universal way that other everyone can relate to and in this scenario it just felt like a tired Trope of why are women complaining about being taken care of financially but it I m not complaining about being taken care of financially right I m complaining about you being a A A piece of A A you know what I m saying like you get what you pay for Chris like shut the A A up you re welcome and then he continued on and the the big the big hook of the night like why Everyone s Watching is they want to know what he s going to say about the slab and then he A A that joke up really yeah he stumbled over the joke and he messed it up in multiple ways so the first one was he s making a joke about how Jada Pinkett Smith was mad at Chris Rock for doing the Oscars because one year they boycotted the Oscars because Will Smith wasn t nominated for a movie called concussion and they called Chris Rock that year and said do not show up at the Oscars and do your job because they have racistly left will out of the running and then his joke was they were so mad that he didn t get an award for a concussion that they gave me a concussion but he called it the wrong movie and then in the middle of the joke he goes I A A up that joke that s the wrong movie it s concussion I A A it up it s all A A up but it s like you re making that much money you A A up your joke find a way to like fix it on the fly my guy like you ve been doing this your whole life you can t ad lib something or like do any sort of Patchwork yourself to bring it back to some degree and then he also was talking about how their bodies are different so like Will Smith fighting him as a A A mode move because he s so little and he s so big right he s like he played Muhammad Ali and I played a very small person I can t remember the characters and he s like you know he even our in our animated movies like Will Smith played a shark and I played a zebra and he s talking about that movie where like he and Will Smith and Angelina Jolie are like under the sea creatures I mean I don t know but yeah anyways Will Smith s a fish in it he s not a shark he s a fish so there s like a bunch of things that are like really sloppy on top of this whole thing and it s like great Chris go get that check and buy yourself some more A A and hopefully you can feel good about that little blunder you had on your live recording of your taped show all right we ll move on to the weekend and Lily Rose Depp defending their new show the Idol with new director Sam levingston is it Livingstone I have no idea is it Levinson let s say sam L the the creator of euphoria so there s this show called The Idol coming out on HBO it the director was the the showing of itself is is very provocative and it s about a young woman pop star navigating the super dark toxic toxic uh underbelly of the music industry yes and so HBO had initially had a director that they weren t seeing eye to eye with they fired him brought him I think it was a woman actually oh I didn t I don t know who it was I can t remember who then they brought on Sam L the Creator director of euphoria and uh Sam Levinson and now like Rolling Stone did this huge hit piece about how Sam is just a horrible person well using more words than that the I didn t read the Rolling Stone article so so the word on the street is that the creative of the show has shift from shifted from what the original director was working on and now the storyline is about Lily Rose Depp s toxic relationship with the weekend and she can and the um they re saying that Lily s character maintains an abusive relationship with the weekend because it inspires her music and that s the story they re following and the problem that a lot of the crew people and what the Rolling Stone article was hoping to highlight is that this is like a rape fantasy show now um and I can t we can t really speak to the details of it because we haven t seen it the weekend her like business person or her boyfriend I think it s both and I think he s treating her like A A and she decides to keep being treated like A A because she thinks it makes her make better music that s what the crew was saying the storyline is well him treating her like A A and her accepting it also allows her to keep making music and I I don t know about the show but I think in a lot of a lot of music scenarios probably before all of me too this wasn t something that didn t happen I I mean you know what girls were doing for acting roles and what people were doing to get their careers launched in Hollywood like it s always sick and twisted like that maybe not now after me too and in but I bet for a very long time a lot of pop stars that had come up were like had the craziest most toxic relationships with people trying to get their career off the ground yeah I think that s true and then also like we know that to be true because of what Kesha went through very publicly with the producer that she used to work with sexually assaulting her so why are they not allowed to tell that a story similar to that like we I don t think we should be censoring our storytelling to not upset people like if you ever watch it don t watch it I think you re right I think that that s a really um I think that s a really hot take on it fine because just because horrible things happen doesn t mean we should not yeah tell stories about them and we don t know what the angle of the show is yet no and all this drama did was make me go and see if it was already out and I was gon na watch it I didn t know about this they re shot a lot of it and they re still cutting it down and I know that the talent like Lily Rose Depp who s you know the quote unquote victim of the show she s saying she loved working with Sam Levinson she felt very protected very respected and like it was a more collaborative project uh that she s ever worked on to be fair I don t know how many projects she s worked on right so for her to be like this is the most whatever director I ve ever A A with it s like right but was the other director just Kevin Smith but I mean if she felt safe and comfortable that s all that really matters you don t have to compare it to something else to know if somebody s treating you like A A or not yeah and there s been a big campaign online to cancel this Sam guy the creator of euphoria in general or like begging that uh Zendaya will stop working with him and leave Euphoria because it s toxic and bad and I m just like all of you guys need to shut the A A up like if Zendaya s powerful enough that if she feels uncomfortable or doesn t want to be in this role she could go I know like when you sign up for TV you sign a big seven year contract but in today s day and age if Zendaya s like I m not comfortable on this set it s not a healthy productive Place she s big enough and powerful enough to go to her agent and say I m not going to do this and if Zendaya is feeling fine and safe and comfortable and happy making Euphoria I think all of you just need to shut the A A up well I think that there s like there s so that s a two fold thing for me because I have heard a majority of the cast love working with him and that it s a highly collaborative environment and I think that that s really cool I know that their story lines get A A unraveled and redirected based off of what talent s feeling on a shooting day and from a person who like creates things as like a writer or whatever like I think that s wild and I ve noticed that story lines that we give a A A about get dropped and then we find ourselves watching Dominic play acoustic guitar for A A five minutes in the finale when we give a A A about other things that we never know right what happened and we never will know yeah so to some degree like I m enraged by A A like that but and I think Sam Levinson s visual Direction and the way that he crafts a show visually keeps and auditorily and tonally and all of that visual storytelling keeps me so hooked on a show where I don t trust the Creator that it s A A impressive yeah and I think that that s really cool um and I think it s gross that he is showing characters who are s nipples A A like porn stars I think that s gross I don t think I want to cancel them for it but I think it s gross makes me not really want to hang out with the guy I think it s A A weird yeah I mean but I have to like I can compartmentalize my things about that the actors are obviously over it s not illegal it doesn t have to do with being illegal no you re showing me a child that I m a character that s a child yes but you re always like a porn star telling a story about high school and while not everyone s A A like a porn star in high school there are people that are A A like porn stars in high school absolutely the same way that they depict drugs and alcohol yes it s like very heightened and over the top to like for entertainment yeah and they re doing that for sex too but I think like if you re doing a show that raunchy it right but you just said that the heightened alcoholism and all that is for entertainment so showing underage sex for entertainment it s gross he s telling a story of high schoolers yeah so there s a way to shoot things like that and to tell the same story and to maintain a raunchy level without showing me a year old or a year old getting butt A A and doing crazy A A like that like I don t need to see the full strip tease I don t need to see a girl getting choked I don t need to see her bent over railed by five A A guys knowing she s a minor I don t need to see the areolas okay I get it I understand what you re saying um to me it s it s like all weird because you know they re over yeah they don t look like they re under they re doing they re like going to high school but you don t ever really feel like they re in high school so like it s weird because storyline wise it like pushes them forward to be in high school but as a viewer you re not like oh I m watching a year old get A A yeah the premise is that yeah okay um are we not friends anymore you A A pervert uh this is a show I am interested in watching though I like the idol yeah I m interested in seeing it I mean I honestly might be exhausted though I m exhausted by the trailers for it all of it just really is like a lot it s like a lot watching this A A frail starving A A wearing no clothes like moving slow motion with a fog up her ass and her A A nipples out like I don t know it s a lot and I might need there to be a story for this one because at least you know there is the substance behind Zendaya s character and there are nuances to these characters in high school that like I feel for and I care about but if I m just watching like a real like I don t know if I can I have that kind of punch let it come out first and then make our judgments I put Pedro Pascal in it for any reason like a sudden hard on for him he s a good man like I know he s like a good looking talented man but they re I think it s his energy in his inner life everyone s acting as though he s gone he s I wish he was I wish he was if he was I bet you anything this world would be a better place okay cardi B wears designer clothes to community service and I just can t get enough of it and she feels like an OOTD every time she goes to communities with her captions too she s like day whatever the A A of community service obey the law uh and then she goes my brains are burning from waking up early community service then Studio but I did the crime so I only have myself to blame so I wrote down what she did but are people upset that she s wearing designer clothes or was that just the like most interesting angle for the headline I don t know if anyone s upset I think we re all just like get it girl it s like the Selfies and she s got her like Louis Vuitton bags and she s like going to do community service and I guess what happened this is court ordered community service after a strip club fight in she pled guilty after ordering an attack on two bartenders because she believed her husband offset had an affair with one of them you know what I m still on her side she kept saying like these moments don t Define me they re not reflective of who I am now and she s like I m a person that always owns up to my past and I just think like God love her it s so refreshing to have somebody like cardi B like just be themselves instead of putting on like this Persona of who they think will be perceived well yeah you know what I mean because in like right now if when you open the internet when you open Tick Tock it s like pandering to everyone s feelings and it s like sometimes can we just exist yeah honestly and can we stop lying and acting like you made a A A recipe dupe for Starbucks s egg souffle bites because you A A didn t okay A A they suck your egg bites are not good they re like a dry frittata this better not be my brother s wife oh my God could you imagine no I love Stacy s recipes I make them okay and I enjoy them all right yeah um yeah I just God I love a woman that will speak her mind yeah well then what s your problem with me I don t think I have a problem with you you mean it you heard it here first though I really like Adam does not have a problem with this I feel like we were fighting but I don t even remember why I don t think we were actually fighting I think I m just mad at the world right which is funny because this is me having chosen to be more positive and every time I m like I m more positive like I m a positive girly now I was like leaving somewhere with my girlfriend over the weekend and this guy s standing in front of the restaurant with like sweatpants on clearly no panties and a huge dick and I went from being like super light really happy and everything to be like God A A damn him some I m gon na next time I come here I m bringing a A A Costco pack of male panties and I m gon na throw them at all these A A who think it s okay to leave the house with their dicks out why do I have to know he s uncircumcised you re such a hurt dude I wasn t no I m not a prude put A A panties on dude just look at his dick I don t want to but I m forced to and that s what is so A A enraging I want to bring my choice back if you have an infant sized penis wear A A underwear with your A A sweatpants in public you sick A A she just made us cut so much it was so explicit it was filled with f bombs you know what I for us this is

Music thank you Music recording recording recording recording one take one hello hello hi hey everyone and welcome to another episode of the Sip I m Ryland Adams of course joined by Lizzie Gordon have you missed me dude yes I ve missed you really I call you every day hey you never answer I know because sometimes I feel like does she need me I always need you are you kidding I m always in Need No the other neediest friend I know we do this often but I said you know what I m in like I had just finished making a breakfast burrito had sweet potatoes in it potato chunks eggs Hot Sauce Cheese I had wrapped it up and I was like Lizzy s calling yeah and I thought hmm does she actually need me in this moment and then I you were like so rude and I said well I m putting a breakfast burrito in my mouth and do you actually need me or do you just need a person to fill the time slot from point A to point B wherever you re going yeah but I wanted that person to be you um what would you hurt yourself no all right well thank you for coming to color I m here for the fried pickles oh my gosh are you gon na make them on your Vlog yeah I want to make them with you this I m going to wait okay okay this is a busy busy girl so she couldn t stay the night to cook with me no she is busy what s going on everything every goddamn thing well I think you need to prioritize our Christmas movie before everything else I have for it that s why that was the first thing done I know and I read it yeah fantastic thank you I laughed out loud the entire time and outside of it just being written for us by you I really do think it s funny regardless I did too so what s our next step in how like who do we have to blow to make this happen we re waiting for Joel to A A read it Joel Joel Joel let s give his number publicly okay I was texting him this morning actually just kidding could you imagine if we doxed Joel Joel I also like in real life I called I call Joel the business A A because he s a business A A he would be mortified if I had doxed him on the internet he was saying his name is probably too much on the internet I think anyone would be pretty pissed if we said hey everyone call this person and tell them to read our script faster the last thing I said it was the psycho text do you think he s gon na read it ever yeah he started reading it which pissed yeah did you tell you should send him the same text you said here s the problem spiraling I couldn t because at the time that we were talking we were talking about something else that was like low key a professional exchange so I couldn t be unprofessional with him though I desperately wanted to be because I have two different modes right like if we re talking as friends I m gon na be uh uh you know inappropriate which is why sometimes I think that you can get in trouble in work environments I said I have two mode two modes one is professional and one is unprofessional and when I was on the phone with Joel We Were In professional mode but had we been in unprofessional mode I would have said I don t appreciate you reading my script in multiple sittings you busy this A A and I understand why you had requested that I read it in one sitting he s enjoyed what he s read so far and how far do you think he is he told me he was pages deep I was like it gets crazy so why would somebody this is not good news for us Lizzy why would somebody start and do pages and then say like he s ooh got ta run from this like spent minutes reading a script and like he s busier than I am okay yeah he started uh he s an executive producer so he s read he s doing uh he s judging uh out fast in Los Angeles right now and he s also okay so gay we re gay so we should be prioritized inside I said that when he told me I was like well you know my script s gay it s got a gay lead maybe two a couple gay leads and one like borderline oh my God what I know for a fact I am not gay wow because I saw a tick tock that says that women who do not find Pete Davidson attractive are not bisexual or gay and then you watch the Haley Bieber interview and then you questioned it all over again no why question being straight after I watched her on call her daddy I didn t watch the whole thing you were the one that put it on the documentation versions I can t say A A call her daddy I feel like call her daddy is always like oh come on okay do whatever have you ever sat down your daddy Furniture um yes who was it uh she had like a gosh she gets big celebrities on there she does get big celebrities on there but it s like to some degree I m just like all right all right all right well we ll get into the caller daddy thing later yeah what were we talking about I blacked out sorry I got so distracted yeah oh no honestly no idea what we re talking about oh I m not gay anyways oh yes welcome to another episode of the suit where we continue to defend Lizzy s heterosexuality um Pete Davidson oh you re done that s all I want to say but I don t remember why I jumped to that oh our gay script yeah Joel get with it dude seriously and if you want we ve got to find a way to make this happen because yeah let me tell you like even outside of me and outside of the Christmas World in which we wrote it for like it can t be fun um cheesy Christmas movie it wasn t that it was like actually well written funny hilarious with over our like story arcs that were also heartwarming and you tied it all together so well so I really like I need this to be a priority yeah come to fruition for the both of us so if everyone could just like Manifest this with us and for us together should we do it let s take a moment okay guys let s take a moment whoever you re manifesting to so like to your higher power blank dear blank dear the universe please Laughter you did that pretty good I was staring at your mouth oh okay well sometimes I ll be in a big group and I feel awkward about this do you yeah it s a little culty it s okay though it s like Colts get things done and do that once a day every day Clip it clip it from the episode write it on your mirror come on we need more than just us we need that we need you now more than ever like for real though I think it s great I m not worried about it being some oh and then another weird like a bunch of weird stuff s been happening I think it s because I m desperately manifesting like like really manifested right it works yeah I didn t even realize I had listed one of the TV Pilots I wrote on a I don t I think it s called I don t even know what the A A this thing is on your resume with followers no no that woman s never getting back to me I uh listed my I don t know where I listed it somewhere online but I got an email the other day that it s in the top of screenplays really yeah in where I don t know because I don t understand it so it might mean nothing but no matter what it was like cool you know okay so I am curious I wanted to know and talk about this earlier on but you were like let s not manifest Doom oh so your lost luggage there was a development later on that it had been found a month and a half later more than that and then you weren t in Colorado so you said just shut up until I have it what happened at the airport today I got my luggage this morning you did I did so you have your suitcase your suitcase back from kiss that was kids that was kisses and that was one of the reasons why they had such a hard time finding it because I d never taken out the name card in the back that s not my name it s hers and did you not tell them you didn t know that no I I didn t know that so it they when they found the name tag in it and they found the luggage and they had my claim they were like it might not be Elizabeth McGarry s because it says it s so and so s right and so when they called I was like well there s a there s a card in the back that has my information on it and they said well that s the problem it doesn t match your information but everything else does and then they were like can you identify some of the items in the bag and I was like there s probably a lot of Jeffree Star makeup in there so it was a little bit of a you issue on accident a little bit of a me issue on accident yeah I know what I wanted to Circle back to the lipstick on my teeth no you don t have staring at my mouth no well I m just looking at you you look good and I love the sweater thank you it s from last season I went out and got a bunch of black sweaters and I m living I want to get some trousers I got these are new pants cute they re very Tick Tock I will say are they like um yes the the non definition at the bottom you know how like skinny was in for a long time I feel like all the young people now are doing the like no shape denim but are the young people also wearing onesies that are unsnapped yeah I m sure the no shaped denim doesn t work for me like when I was trying to be cool with you and I went to Abercrombie I got those but I can t make them work and I don t feel comfortable in the no shaped denim I think it helps a little bit if you have a booty okay wow rude she tells me I don t have a booty I was wondering if Vicki saw that and got mad at me no but the comments were mad at you oh they were yeah wow I stopped reading the comments wow she gets a vlog and she s done with you guys sorry no I ve just I ve been so busy probably healthy no it s I love reading the comments in a Sick Sad way even when the nasty ones but it s like I have been so busy I haven t had a moment you know what I mean oh I almost had a meltdown the other day well and that being yesterday doesn t seem like out of character no but this was like a this is like a different kind of meltdown it was just like I just wan na watch the demilio right but no I had to go to the vet and then the gynecologist and then a party and then I had to come here what s going on with your vagina I mean everybody has to get their snatched spelunked in every once in a while okay it s a natural or it s a normal checkup nothing out of the usual nothing out of the usual oh but what was kind of fun was you know Joe and I are talking about conceiving a child uh next September starting to try next September so I I like to pick up all my birth control at once just like I pick up all the dogs like flea and heart medicine at once because otherwise I m gon na A A that up and uh they were like oh you know what we can only give you enough for uh through August of next year and I go Kismet wow yeah and when I told Joe that he was just like I don t what the A A does that mean I was like it means the universe is saying yes listen up Joe listen up Joe write it on your mirror write it on your mirror I ll have his mom text him Marge is watching right now does he want a baby yeah okay good yeah I want to make sure you re on the same page we re on the same page we were at breakfast the other morning and I was just like having kids is A A scary yeah and he was like yeah I was like wow foreign and then like after having a pap smear from not having one from the last time I had one I just like was texting all my friends that had babies and I was like how did you have people in your snatch all the time like that is awful and I had a great doctor too she s got a great bedside man she s like okay I m gon na touch your thigh now and it s like okay like the whole time you get tingly I m just doing another lesbian check oh no okay in fact I m like when I got home I told Joe did not touch me for a little while because even though this woman was very nice and the whole time she had like this great bedside manner she was like I want you to know I m leading the pap smear but you re in charge and at any time if you want me to stop I ll stop and told me every time she s gon na touch my body anywhere because it s like that s incredibly invasive well I m sure that s changed over the past four years yeah well I mean did they have to have another I mean you should always respect somebody when you re in their genitals but they have to have another a secondary person to watch I heard with the men I would rather die than have a man spelunk in my snatch well okay so but if I were to have a girl give me a physical I think for the ball portion now another person has to come in triple my boner fear anyways which by the way what the boner fear made the movie made the movie made the movie a lot of fun a lot of the best moments from the podcast did or scenarios in which we re we ve lost it we re inspirational for a young kid of like myself narcissistic I don t know should I talk about your mean girl Behavior mine yes I was pretty offended actually what are you A A hasn t happened once but it s happened twice what some every time I dress up as a girl on the internet it seems like minutes later a negative nasty comment flies in from lissy and I m just like what s your intention maybe I m jealous are you uncomfortable are you jealous of what well how pretty I am as a woman honestly did I send you the text from Haley no Haley took a screen grab of it she said rylan s A A beautiful no more so it s that I m calling you and you re not answering because you re dressing up as a woman in a bathing suit with fake tits now oh I forgot to bring my titties oh well Halloween s coming up we ll do a whole episode in our fake tits I have fake tits too we have to find something to cover the nipples frame them out I m like oddly infatuated with those they re kind of fun huh couple things are making me straight this week Haley Bieber and fake tits right oh that s why you thought your shirt just because you want to A A her I would honestly Haley makes me wonder if I m gay because I would A A her that middle part was just so effortlessly perfect she s just so crisp that screamed gay huh she s Frosty no that I appreciated her middle part maybe yeah yeah a little game but it s just like you look at her and you re like wow can I since we re on the topic can I show you a picture of my puppy because I feel like he looks good no listen I think he has a great middle part too no but I think he looks like an alpha guy do you know what I mean like the guy at the club who s like very forceful and wants to dance with you and you end up sucking his dick violently in the bathroom wow is that not my puppy did you hook up with people drunk at the clubs when you were young I didn t even go to clubs wow but look at him like a little gay right wow his that is an ass shot if I ve ever seen one like he s asking for it why does he have a human ass I don t know so he s like a power he s a dominant bottom I think he s a power top oh well the way he s showing his ass and like really this to me is like picture another dog down there just like blowing him okay is that weird a little bit he s just a little gay yeah so like on my uh on my women on my woman look you said you re calling the cops yeah and then if I knew how to work Tick Tock I would find the last mean comment that you said but I don t know if I know how to comment on Tick Tock so I wouldn t I think I screen grabbed your story and sent it to you in a private text oh and I said is this what you ve been doing for minutes and why you haven t responded to me and I said absolutely yes yes and do you actually need anything from me no but I am calling the cops because I look so sickening yeah okay everybody knows it okay like people like it s like a like you are a hot girl and so let s move on to some things that I don t understand about you okay so talk about Mean Girls well no I m saying like when you re sometimes I don t respond respond to your text because I don t understand what you re trying to get across and so like you re sending me pictures this weekend that I just didn t understand and then you kept going on and on and on about them and I just thought I don t get it so what picture really what I said the AI things oh my God okay you don t know about the AI sketch no so there s a new app where it s like artificial intelligence draws what you tell it to so you see what what do you mean that s crazy yeah well that s that was my shocked face yeah I thought you were like oh no it s crazy wait so you can say like Ryland and Lizzy making a Christmas movie in yeah but I sent you pictures of I because I literally said Ryland and Lizzy and it drew us you re really hot in it fully know me and it doesn t fully know you but it makes you very hot and then I did in what sort of way like do I look like a human I sent you the pictures I didn t understand them when you sent them are you talking about me breastfeeding my dog those pictures I don t think I got the one of us together oh those are well you did I sent it to you a long time ago because I ve been wanting to talk about it on the podcast and then I did you know Lizzie Gordon breastfeeding her French Bulldog and that was A A wild we ll put that up and you oh here it is it s not saved in your app oh my gosh wait yeah crazy right without any context you tell this AI app yeah Ryland Adams and Lizzie Gordon it did my pink highlights okay that s you re terrifying from a year ago as Charlie demilio but no it s from March you had pink in my oh not like the strips yeah oh okay see how well I know you and then there s me sitting on the couch and then there s you sitting on the couch well it s rude that it made me more handsome you re really handsome that s rude but yeah the ones of me breastfeeding the dog are particularly a free app I don t know what s it called what well someone did it for me wonder and then I wanted to know what it looked like if I breastfed my dogs and this is what it did well and that s what she sent me without any contacts so she s like me breastfeeding my dogs and I thought like okay what I want to print all of these like super artsy style and put them all over my house because it s like I identify as a mother to these dogs but it s like I m not so I was looking for like a maternal image it s disturbing this is probably gon na get me canceled huh um what I don t know uh do you want to talk about your Epiphany from applying to AFI yeah I was gon na talk about it in my Vlog that posted yesterday well then why did you put it in the podcast notes I mean sorry check out my Vlog this is what you so when you claim your notes broke you just have a note running for your Vlog now no I literally you can look through it my notes are A A gone it s crazy all of them gone because we always have a shared note to write things that are so important that we need to share with them AI breastfeeding dog I can t find my note and I said well what I know it s crazy I don t believe you will go through my phone bro and the new one that I sent you doesn t work either okay it s nuts see shared notes none found bummer Apple wants you to buy a new phone which is insane because I got this in April I know but they re releasing a new one they can suck my titty like an AI Frenchie okay so let s talk about AFI AFI all right so um I there are I m like we were recently saying I m trying to manifest opportunities for myself I was at a barbecue and this woman who is incredibly talented and esteemed as a director um said have you tried afi s female forward director program and I said actually like I I intend to I ve signed up to be on a mailing list to be notified when the application s open and oddly enough AFI did not notify me which is deeply personal because they keep inviting me to a A A movie night like I don t want to go to your movie night AFI I want to apply to your programs anyways or anyway she said they asked her if she had anybody she wanted to refer and she was like if you submit let me know and I ll pull your file for them as a referral and I was like oh A A that s incredibly valuable nobody likes me so it s really nice to have someone who is liked offer to vouch for me okay we ll wrap back to why I think you get yourself into trouble whatever and then is it that is it that attitude yes it s because sometimes you re unaware when you re demanding and like I ve known you for so many years yeah that I know when it s like oh it s just Lizzy being Lizzy or to tell you okay Lizzy you re being nuts no anyways we ll pick it up from offer to pull my file okay oh I can t name names we ll pick it up so this woman graciously offered to pull my file I hate doing these applications because it takes a lot of time and energy to write nine literally nine essays to like beg for these people to like you and then you pay them a A A ton of money so that they can read your application and tell you whether or not they are college admissions it s like a college admissions there s no tuition for the college but then you need to raise to grand for your own project after sending them dollars for a Diversity Program application mind you and uh I don t like doing it I don t like putting myself out there super vulnerably sharing the most private parts of my soul and explaining who I am creatively to somebody who s never met me and there s their core function is to say whether or not I m approved by them and in most cases they probably wouldn t even read it because they have people like who may be referring you yeah they might have a hundred people that have graduated from AFI that are like oh this is a person s application that I think you should look at and if it s nine essays looking at people s essays is exhausting yeah and then you have everyone else that wasn t recommended it s like yeah you know and and it sucks but as Michael Scott quoted Wayne Gretzky or whatever you miss of the shots you don t take yeah and as I m always saying I can t control other people I can only control myself I can not control the results all I can control is what I put into it yeah so uh finding the relief in that I put my best foot forward and I you know put together what I feel is a very strong body of work that I have been working on for years yeah you know so I had to do I had to provide two sample short films I had to provide a director video intro that just introduces who I am like all of this vlogger I got it honestly I finally had that thought because I ve had I ve been asked to do a video before and it s like well I ll just sit here with my phone and be like I am a good candidate because I am a candidate for goodness and now yeah you ve developed a muscle of showing personality inside of a personal video and that s the that s the other thing my friends and I were laughing about they re like show a little more personality I was like people don t like me people like people don t like my personality you know even if it goes unread I will say I believe the energy you put out will come back to you maybe it won t be in the form of AFI recognizing you or picking you but I do think in a different realm it just adds to your manifestation list absolutely what you re attracting into your life absolutely so good for you thank you I m proud thank you you re welcome and then I texted the woman and I emailed the woman I submitted and she didn t respond you re like I spent no I mean it just was like figures she probably hates me too like you re like and then like I was like laying in bed at night and thinking about this guy that gets like everything because he s constantly asking for it and I was like A A that that guy s not even talented like I can t even read through his writing without like I have to read it times to make it make sense and he like gets things because he keeps asking well and that s half of Hollywood honestly how you position yourself in places even more so than the talent you have yeah so I emailed her again I said hey just making sure you got this that is me and then she responded she said yes I did get it go ahead and send me your samples if you want and so I sent them to her on the way here what yeah okay yeah wow she probably still doesn t like me but at least I m like that A A guy who s getting somewhere now um and my question of the day is what the A A does simping actually mean like I understand my private life right now no I m not I don t everyone says simping on the internet I think we ve done I think we ve done a deep dive into something are you kidding me no no yeah I think we have because I understand like it means like I m lusting after someone yeah but pathetic what is it actually what does simping mean simping is just one of the dating trends that exists within many others and was created primarily by gen Z culture a simp or simping refers to when someone obsesses over someone else who does not return their affection but what is oh doesn t return so what wow that really you need to know that element too because people say it I m just thinking oh they re just love that person but I didn t know it was unreciprocated love so what is does s i m p stand for something like so impossibly no but I love I love that you re looking deeper into it I think it I think it does related I don t think it person I know that it s uh gen z may have coined it recently but I know that it s in songs that date well before their birth dates okay and I also think about the Mariah Carey song why are you so obsessed with me okay well I know you will know a lot more than us because when I didn t know what a what job was oh gosh I forgot sham a sham job everyone s like at home mom it really went over me too I was like I don t know like fake ass A A today s podcast is sponsored by studs who I love so very much and I know you ve

yeah without all this iced tea in the world all the iced tea in the world well yeah there s quite a few well oh he s handing me the clipboard yeah um all right you want to talk about how Uber is being used for drug runs this I m unaware of okay so apparently with Uber you can now use it sort of like as a carrier service so yeah so if you wanted to send me something from your house in Calabasas you could toss that A A in an Uber and send it to me so I could have had them go to the airport pick up your luggage and bring it to my house for you yeah but why would you do that well I mean if you weren t coming to the airport yeah again yeah okay um yeah okay well no I don t think that would have worked because someone would have had to take it from the lost and found to the Uber but if you can so if my mom has a document I need right now I can send them to her house and grab it yes that s pretty cool it s pretty G and you know who else has capitalized on this is drug dealers and Drug receivers are you sure positive what like really yeah and so what happens if the Uber driver gets pulled over without his truck here s why it s A A up because the Uber drivers are driving their personal vehicles this one man was asked to bring to carry drugs he was like oh no dude like this seems like drugs and the guy was like I m taking your picture I m taking a picture of your car and they have their license plate numbers like all this information and they can check the car on its path and know if it derails from their path so you can t go to the police station and you have and he s like if something happens and these don t get delivered something bad is going to happen to you I would say got ta go yeah great definitely say that to a guy who s already threatening your life yeah thanks you know I got ta go and then Uber penalizes you for canceling our ride okay well I think Uber should be a little more inventive about how they re going about it man is inherently evil and what the A A drug dealers you have like two parts to your job deal the drugs yourselves stop A A making Tyler on the streets A A take your A A yeah who s just trying to be a hard working citizen yeah that s Insanity yeah it is so what happens has has there been an instance where a cop pulls somebody over and they re just like it s not mine go to Uber I don t think there s been an instance of that but I do know that like Uber s sharing information with the police in a few open drug cases oh so at least they re participating with yeah but the problem is is like there is no way to curb this unless they just cancel the carrier service option so how did we discover this is my question was somebody too afraid to derail the line and go to the police in fear of the drug dealer seeing it but they weren t afraid to whip out Tick Tock and talk about it no I mean I saw it on the news and this guy was like his voice was altered his face was not visible and he s talking about the experience like inside edition I m sure yeah okay Haley Bieber on caller daddy circling back to Haley Vibra and call her daddy wow she really is beautiful not in love with the furniture on this set wow that s your takeaway I just thought yeah when I started watching the video I thought wow she got like plus million for this contract and she really is I will give the call her daddy girl after the Scandal her name s Alex breaking up with her counterparts Sophia yeah um which we did follow because I think everyone in the world followed because it was just so crazy and scandalous um she without a co host she really has transitioned to show where she exploited her own sexual life and doings to getting a listers on her show yeah so the transition is quite incredible that she s getting the Demi Lovato s and Haley beavers of the world and even I think Miley Cyrus went on which was the first like big celebrity that I had seen on her show but good for her I wish she would get a little different Furniture yeah her set looks like a Marriott hotel room and she shows up and which I like I get it like be disarming for whoever you re interviewing she s whatever she s doing is working for her so let s not talk A A about her but Haley Bieber I thought it was interesting that the whole interview they re like trying to be like I m outside of which I get this isn t Haley s fault but every time they try to move away from Justin it goes back to Justin I mean I do wonder if it was all about Justin in the first place just because Haley gets so much hate online so I wonder if this was the intention of this was to finally address the Justin stuff in the hopes that she would stop getting hate online oh also I just realized guess who sits like a A A lesbian Haley Bieber I think she was just a little nervous and that s how she felt most comfortable same I just thought it was fascinating because the whole interview is leading up to the Pinnacle where she kind of talks about how she hasn t ever talked or she has actually talked to Selena Gomez yeah since they ve her and Justin have been married and she would never expect Selena to go out of her way to address it because maybe in Selena s mind Selena would think that it would cause more of an uproar yeah and but then once she s like okay enough about this let s move on to your sex life with Justin Bieber like he just never got away from Justin Bieber I mean that was just I mean it s called her daddy s what how like tell me about it missions they liked what favorites doggy style what what tell me more well I kind of stopped listening after that okay I got to that and I was like okay I get where this is going and then I got to how to referee I will say like Haley sorry no we talk about sex so I can t hate on it but it s just like don t do that who cares what do you mean like why you have a Haley Bieber here of all people I mean I don t think and you want to talk about her doggy style fantasies that s what call her daddy like got massively popular for was like the sexual Adventures right got it people got it and so like when a celebrity goes on they re gon na talk about their sex life and even though like Haley was a little like reserved about it and then finally gave an answer so it wasn t like Haley was like out the gates trying to talk about her sex life with Justin yeah and she did like wrap around to make it sweet and be like what turns Justin on is more like an intimate moment between us that leads to sex and yeah she said that she likes Justin because of his openness in his heart and how he cares and loves and whatever um I just think it s interesting that like Haley and Kendall Jenner who are friends in real life they re such realized women yeah and I think they both A A Justin Bieber probably doggy style honestly they re asking my sisters and I was thinking well yeah they do have a lot of traumatic events that happen in their lives and I thought like rapping into the Kardashians which we will talk about their new season as well but Kendall s very into like working her health from the inside out and so she like got her brain scammed which happened to be at the same place that Morgan got her brain stand and so she took Chloe to get her brain scan to see if Chloe could like learn more about what s going on with her in a state of like the actual trauma that s affected the brain and what I thought was fast Kendall was like well I d love to see what s going on inside of Kim s because Kim always has like every day is a new a new trauma and Kim so I was like my strength is my calmness yeah and it really is yeah and I thought about that the other day I was like damn that A A do be staying calm and Kendall wanted to take Chloe because Kendall was like you re obviously going through so much and this whole season of the Kardashians Chloe is like I m the picture of resilience like she s got it times which like if that s what she believes I mean she is like I mean she is she is but like she said it times yeah and Kendall goes I know but you are the picture of that but are you dealing with it or are you pushing it aside yeah I actually love Kendall saying sometimes to get through it you got ta go through it and there s a difference from just being like that happened power through yeah versus being like let s address the trauma and try not to let that affect the daily patterns of my life from here on out yeah and so that s why I was like Wow Kindle is so realized and then I listened to the Haley on caller Daddy and I was like Haley so realized and it was I was like well they have such big extravagant lives but they also have the time and money to go to seven day therapy Retreats where they don t you know so it s like it is a luxury jury to be able to spend so much time on your mental health but they re also in a position where their mental health has affected so much more than the average person in a different way in a different way like everyone has struggles yeah I think everyone has struggles and I think that you know there s no I I don t think that you should compare struggles I think it s on a different yeah I think they re all different and it s like you don t need to say like oh I don t have struggles because I m not Kendall Jenner or I would say the opposite typically that s what I m saying or I struggle and Kendall Jenner doesn t like I don t think it ever worked like mental struggles I think it s just outside of the natural human experience what a human a hugely famous person ghost yeah because it s not normal for millions of people to weigh in on your every move and the weight that that holds is very large I m not saying that the weight that anybody else s life holds is not yeah but it is also a very big luxury to be able to have the time to be so realized yeah but good for them yeah there s also like just you know for the record there are uh things open and available to a person who s not Mega Rich to become fully realized oh of course yeah yeah look into that if you need it so well should we pivot right into the Kardashians then I feel like we did it well you have nothing else on the two episodes all you cared about was no I mean I feel like we re already here we pivoted okay yeah so what were your standouts um I mean every we ve touched on all the standouts okay well for me lots and lots of babies I have baby envy and I know what s meant for me is gon na come but I m just like so many A A babies yeah it like makes my heart hurt a little bit how many babies there are I m like oh because of the births being every episode now yeah yeah I get that and I m just like I want a baby so bad I love having all these babies Chrissy like should I get some wine should we bring wine she s gon na need these snacks baby get the cheetah pups let s go a stand up moment and probably just like non stop filming I look Corey being like baby baby it s the time she goes oh my God yes honestly I watched the Kardashians for the house porn at this stage of my life because it s just so unreal that every shot is just like they could be doing nothing and the show is still entertaining because of the the scenery what s going on around sometimes I feel like they re walking and they go buy a room they go oh I forgot I had that room Chris forgetting she has an entire A A condo oh god oh forgot I had a house here I kind of love how they re not living on the internet s timeline which is like acting because I see like with a lot of reality shows you ll start to see the characters act on how they think Twitter s reaction is going to be and it s so funny to me like even Kim with her private jet like all these celebrities got so canceled for their their private job use and she s just on the phone with kind of like you re gon na experience Khmer what do you want for lunch and then Kendall s like well I m gon na get a spray tan and Kim goes you are not gon na get your sprays are you cashmere seats you might be a kid she just doesn t give a A A she s just like like the whole world s upset about private jets and she s like you are not gon na ruin my cashmere seats oh my God God love you Kim did you see Kim s uh Dolce Gabbana show no it s pretty sweet what do you mean so she went through I think it s Dolce and Gabbana yeah Kim did a whole like runway show for Dolce Gabbana at Fashion Week and it s pretty sick dude it s just it opens with like a short film that she made of just her looking like glamorous as A A eating a plate of pasta I saw I couldn t get through that on Instagram nobody could but I watched the majority of it and I was like it hit I was like damn dude do you know how much money they probably spent on that one shot of Kim Kardashian eating that A A pasta a lot of money I mean good for Kim I love it she never stops that girl and I do think she works hard and I think she s on to something when she says people don t want to work I agree I don t want to work well that s what I m saying I do I do like a week full of like dedicated work with this tight schedule like the equivalent of Kim s but less A A up like and I m like I want wan na watch into millions and that s the thing though like I do think that would make a normal person person fall to the ground the way that the world responded to her saying that yeah because I don t think her intentions were as ill as the world responded no and you can never uh you can never guess how the world will react to something yeah but the fact that she just like plows forward and is like yeah whatever and that s the other thing that s like super like so the proof is in the pudding right she works that hard and she has Kim air with cream cashmere seats you know what I mean and I know you guys want to go out there and say that she A A red and made a video and it s like yeah but she A A and made the video a lot of people A A on camera have you seen PornHub lots of couples are out there A A and making a A A porn tape and they re not on Kim air I ll criticize some of how I think it went down even though I don t know but what I won t criticize or what I won t stand for is people being like well she s only famous for a sex tape because like no she s A A no she s A A not nobody can maintain and build relevancy like Kim Kardashian because of a sex tape look you you have to constantly be at it and I think as a contrast you could watch the demilius yeah and you can see like Charlie Who Rose to fame on her own Merit I would say without a specific Talent I m not saying she doesn t have talents because obviously she can dance which does kind of bother me that she s on Dancing it s so not fair like she is a classically trained dancer maybe she doesn t know one or two of the styles that they do on Dancing With the Stars but it s just not A A Fair no and I m happy that like if that lights are so on fire and she s getting to do what she loves every day I think good for Charlie yeah but I don t think it s fair for any of the other contestants and so here s the other thing like I love Charlie I actually really do like watching her dance can t get me to watch Dancing with the Stars I well no the only person watching that is my grandma oh JoJo brought me in oh I watched JoJo s I also watched America s Got Talent to watch the A A xomg pop ladies out there killing it in those streets so you re even like JoJo s uh Offspring yeah everything JoJo related I m into it judges got a new girl wow yeah okay crazy Avery but I will say like in contrast from the Kardashians to the dimelios this season I I did like watch the first two episodes of the demilios and it s interesting to see like Charlie struggle with where she wants to go because she skyrocketed to fame and she s like like well now I feel like I m wasting an opportunity because I don t have a clear Direction in where I want to go yeah and it s this whole thing of like being famous for being famous like there s not a true reason like the Kardashians are not only entertaining because like they are there there are elements of their family Dynamic that is fascinating to watch I think when you watch the demilios it s more fascinating for a different reason not because like the family s super funny uh yeah I can t tell why I care about the demilios like I couldn t tell you but I do you know what I m saying like I really do I think the girls are cute I feel like a lot of the story lines are fabricated for drama though yeah also Joe can t stand it I have to watch it in the bedroom he s like turn it off I hate their voices it s like okay bubs loves it yeah I mean I watched both episodes yeah in their entirety so I guess keep doing what you re doing girls yeah don t stop keep it moving I heard Charlie s acting in a horror movie good for her yeah I ve also noticed that Charlie has started speaking on her voice more which is pretty cool because I don t know if you remember but they used to be like these little whisper girls they re teenagers that got famous I mean I think that they have uh done a little bit of work on themselves to find their voices because it s very clear now that Charlie s talking yeah and it s like oh cool girl it still kills me a little bit that like Dixie will be in rehearsal and be like well even just the fact that Charlie s like the game day girls singing yeah and it s like she knows she s like well I can t tell people about it because I d have a record deal and like that makes me sick a little bit you know wait what do you mean she was like I want to keep this to myself because everything I do becomes a business like all of my hobbies have become a business and the fact that Charlie could tell her team at her Monday meeting with employees yeah I want to sing and could have a record deal tomorrow like makes me sick a little bit I know that they they work they garnered that opportunity for themselves but then you see a Dixie in rehearsal who like doesn t want to perform and tell the performance which like I understand it s just well no I saw that and I was like no one would give you a chance then like nobody would give you she s getting chances and then she s a jingle bells or balls or whatever yeah good for them yeah okay what s next what s next do we want to talk about the try guys if you want to I love delicious cooking made simple and that s why I m so happy today s

are out of the world right so do you know about the Adam Levine oh my God I m such a A A idiot I thought it was a different atom what I thought it was a different app there s a different atom cheating no it s not it s Adam Levine from Maroon I m a A A idiot I thought it was one of the guys from Workaholics oh what s that guy s name Vine or something yeah I was like imagine him he seems like stupid yeah that was crazy did you follow the atom thing I followed it in like just on Tick Tock I just can t believe how blatantly people will act out like this like DM me like I m writing like a platform in a Strange World in which we know people go to tick tock to go viral over this sort of thing because it s just so sloppy and to be in that sloppy and comfortable of a position when you re married with kids in another on the way just to me is like gives me the ick it s icky I wonder if it gives them the ick too and if it s part of it it can t stop it like it s a weird addiction I mean it has to be because it s such a reckless damaging thing to do that I feel like you have to be self sabotaging to put something in writing like what he did right also is he stupid and to deal with like if you do you see the text like he s like A A like your body s insane like is he actually stupid because if he s actually he sounds stupid I but so this might just be a dumb man doing a dumb thing I don t I mean it s a pretty dumb thing or itself like you have two kids and another on the way it s pretty obvious that that s not something you should be doing he asked one of the women if he could name the new baby after her yeah I know Rayland crazy insane and I more so Phil and this is what I mean like I m not saying everyone s problems aren t large but imagine being the wife on the other side that s A A up she has to deal with all of us talking about it the whole world talking about it and you know if she stays with him or if she stays with him it will forever haunt her it will be every interviewer s question it defines the next five years of her life if she decides to stay with him yeah you know what I mean and that s annoying for her for the kids for the family because somebody else wanted to go and do something stupid which isn t unsimilar to the try guy situation yeah it is the try guys situation is bold as A A well it s just interesting to me that this one went so the try guys are like it s mainstream well yeah their drama is mainstream and they are very popular but I feel like they re under the radar are popular yeah like because you go to their Channel and they re still getting millions of views on every video to be honest I didn t I don t know dick about the try guys but I could tell you their like if I saw them in public I would know that they were famous do you know what I mean never seen an episode didn t know they identified as the try guys probably would have thought they were Queer Eye For The Straight Guy which is I get it yeah even though I m pretty sure they re all straight like no they re not yeah hooking up with one of the employees yeah one of The Producers but did you hear did you see how it all broke yes somebody they were at a bar like cooking up or something Harry Styles concert together Oh I thought it was taking pictures with fans and then later on that night kissing in public were in the same outfit so the story was corroborated they went to a A A concert and then made out in public what I thought was interesting because even his wife is very entwined in the business like the wives have a podcast on their channel that seems so the wives make videos on their Channel and so for them to come to the conclusion because both of the statements from the guy and the girl were both like our family is the most important thing eluding in my opinion too that they re going to try to work it out and stay together for the family I don t know if that s what will happen after they go through therapy or whatever they choose to do yeah but it s interesting that the try guys were like we see no way forward he s out of the group I get it though because that is so incred like if you are Incorporated together like if you and I run a business together I now am responsible for every shitty thing you do right so if he s gon na go out cheat on his wife and uh you know who has kids with somebody that they re working with now they re who s a subordinate now they re risking a sexual harassment lawsuit well and yes I think even more so than their feelings towards him actually cheating on his wife yeah it s that it was with an employee yeah because then it s like adds a whole new level where they almost can t continue forward with him but now the wife and the husband have no job technically they let the I don t did they let the wife go well I don t think she was Tech well I guess she s probably an employee of sorts because she does have a podcast on the channel I don t know it s all and I think it s all well in good to like work with your spouse as a person you work with your A A spouse all the time too and I don t know like I don t love it it s not my favorite thing it s a fine line to walk yeah I like doing the educational videos with Joe because it s a low stakes environment and we can have fun and be silly but it s like on other projects it s a little bit hard yeah it s too much and having the burden of your relationship and a professional relationship or maybe one of you does have more power or one of you is a boss like it s kind of different and skewed yeah like I don t I don t like it no and I feel like I don t know it would have been more empowering or like whatever to set the wives up with their own thing that s separate I don t know well I think the podcast was separate like it s the wife s right it s not oh I think I haven t done a deep dive on the channel I haven t either but I do think it s like meh anyways let s get into all the movies and TV shows because there s like a lot of hot things going on in the entertainment world that is a reason I love fall because a lot of good content drops where I feel like we were lacking for a while and now I m on overload there s so much to watch did you see Hello darling yes oh no don t worry darling don t worry darling what did I say I love nipple girl uh yeah what s up with that well I like hated her online Persona which isn t fair because she didn t write that like the Press wrote her narrative for her right like shoot her after you looked at her Instagram though so it was personal okay she curates her own Instagram okay that I ll give her or you but I will say like in large part I was annoyed by all of of the headlines and press which is out of her control and then we went to see the movie because like the review the reviews were like I don t know we were just intrigued to see the movie and she was the best part about the movie hands down everybody s saying that she was incredible she even bad reviews are saying Florence is a force the annoyance that I once had with her is no longer like I m not looking at her Instagram but I just I hated her on Instagram and then I loved her in the media like I love her whole Miss flow reclaiming the title thing and I do think she s talented yeah she s she s incredible she was great and I actually did like the movie do you know what the movie s about did you see it um I didn t see it but I think you could I can guess what it s about okay spoiler alerts spoiler mine s a guess and you can tell me if I m right I m guessing that it s about like a group of people who live outside of like the normal communities and this is a specific isolated space that s almost culty like a culty commune and all like to some degree handmaidens daily and Florence feels like she s suffocating because of everyone has to be happy and chipper and bright all the time and eventually she wants to get out but nobody s allowed to get out because there s something else yesterday or do you want to see it I m probably not going to see it okay well if you flip forward I ll have chapters in this podcast so flip forward to the next chapter if you don t want to spoil her and she probably kills Harry Styles she s in a simulation and it turns out that the husbands are putting the wives in the simulation because they want to have like in Florence is a nurse in real life and she s overworked and the husband damn I wish you hadn t told me I could not have seen that being some I could not have seen this movie being that be having an additional layer I really enjoyed it I wish that life after the simulation we would have gotten minutes less of the movie in the simulation and had there been beats outside of where she is confronting some of the evil people that have like created it or getting revenge or seeing like the people that started the simulations or maybe like hardcore losers in real life like I needed that extra beat which is actually like I didn t think about it until we left and Shane was like it needed that beat and then we were building on that and I thought oh my gosh you re right but I thought Olivia did a good job in the direction of the movie it was fun to watch it was set in Palm Springs I had a great time with it nice and with all the drama with Olivia sorry I ruined it for you but you said I could oh I couldn t I never could have anticipated it I mean I think Olivia goes big visually I and then I was and that s always fun I was watching a review about like talking about the movie in general and they were saying like because there s the alleged beef between Olivia and Florence and I guess Florence then the day the movie was released did like two like slides long posts like a bunch of photos and the girl I was watching joked she was like her agent called and said well if the movie flops then it reflects upon you in the box office as well which is like what this girl had suspected why Florence finally like caved in and promoted the movie and put Olivia like seven pictures into the slide interesting but I liked it a lot yeah I mean I think so not for nothing I m just gon na talk about Olivia Wilde for a second um not for nothing she so book smart I didn t give a A A about it I mean it s a little bit I know that it was super lauded and everybody was super into it and like it s like this feminine A A thing but to be completely honest that movie was way too similar to super bad to a degree where I m like this didn t need to be made it s just girl super bad with one of the stars of superbad s sisters you know what I mean like that s how close it is like it s the same A A characters right just with coochies and I you know whatever it is what it is I just kind of feel like could have changed a little more but I do feel like Olivia Wilde stylized a lot of the shots and make it and made it visually engaging and differentiated it more from super bad which was a little bit more of a Lo Fi sort of organic Vibe and hers was a slightly more visually elevated thing but no matter what I just still find myself feeling like make a A A girls movie give give a woman a chance like whatever I also am irritated because I saw my best friend s exorcism and I m just like I should have directed that and I know that that s a big lofty A A thing to say but I keep seeing these movies where it s like is that in theaters now I don t know you know how I get all my movies but it s like I watched at home and I m I was excited by the prospect of it like I ve had a bunch of ideas where it s like young girls in high school coming of age like the birth and death of relationships with your best friends and like all of those things and I always think through like a skewed sort of horror comedy lens but this was directed by a man and quite frankly for a concept so big as my best friend s exorcism No One Believes Me My Best Friend s possessed by a demon and I must exercise it from her as two Catholic school girls in the s like that s A A cool and I watched this thing and I m just like if it weren t for the score this movie would be flat as A A the scores having to inform everything like it s it s isolated still frames made by a guy who was never a A A girl who can t identify with these things so there s no feeling or intention in any of these shots there s certainly no A A style because he s never had to think outside of his simpleton box to get an opportunity I is it well I I don t know anything about the movie so I don t know if it s like a wide release if it s gon na be video on demand I haven t heard about it yeah I don t know but the point being is like I think that Olivia Wilde goes A A big and if people want to A A and complain about it call it derivative say that she doesn t understand what she s knocking off Go the A A ahead I don t no matter what white on the into wide audiences are sitting through her A A and liking it yeah and I don t think uh her male counterparts would get the same critiques or publicity that she has been neither do I ringed through this entire Prospect of the movie yeah so anyways I m upset I know you had already mentioned that you had seen fall and you said you hated it yeah I thought the dialogue The Fall it s about um well it s about a couple of dumb A A who go out to the middle of nowhere with no safety precautions nobody knows where the A A they are and they re supposed to be skilled enough climbers that they re free soloing up a A A cliff and they make they re climbing up a radio tower well in the intro they re supposed to be such skilled climbers that they re literally climbing up like a million foot flat surface cliff and then they make every single amateur mistake they could possibly make as if they re just a couple of year old boys who have found a A A dangerous thing to go get tetanus on her boyfriend ends up dying and then through her grieving a year later her best friend says let s go climb this radio tower in honor of him to get past what you re going through and spread his ashes at the top they get stuck at the top that s all in the trailer so we re not spoiling anything I thought once they were halfway up the radio tower it did get fun and I thought their acting got a lot better I thought the dialogue in the first half of the movie was so cringy I ve got tricky Prime day you go A A yourself their interpretation of vloggers yeah crazy like she s holding the Vlog camera like this hey YouTubers and I m like whoa you re also calling them YouTubers you re the YouTuber who wrote this and I so yes the first half I was like I don t know if we can get through this because the dialogue was just so cringe cringy well it s a low low budget movie but once they got up there I did think that he did tension well the writer director I thought like I was on edge in like I was like I couldn t get on edge because the whole time thinking like my God are you A A stupid you just threw your shoes off and you have to walk down this A A thing Barefoot you dumb A A well what I found interesting also think about how hot that A A metal A A would have been climbing up they don t even have gloves okay I hear you I hear all of your things my whole wrap around to this was after the fact I watched their like little minute making of and the reason I think the acting got so much better what I discovered was because those A A are actually like that s a real structure yeah they like really did build the structure and they filmed it in the elements and The Blonde one really did die okay spoiler alert maybe yes I thought it was fun enough I thought I would not I d be disappointed if I went to the movie theaters but if you re at home and you want to watch just a campy movie with your boyfriend or girlfriend it s fun enough yeah I mean the whole time I was just like oh so the blonde one A A her boyfriend okay more spoilers I m gon na have to put a spoiler okay uh did you actually want to talk about uh this one do Revenge yeah what is it so do Revenge was made by that directorus who has multiple names Jennifer Caitlin Robinson I wouldn t know I think I m fully A A that up okay but I really like that woman and she is a good person and I want to give her a shout out on this podcast right now because two times in my life she doesn t A A know me and she has done two very cool things for me specifically how do you know her I don t she s a A A stranger so a million a million years ago when all I wanted to do was act she was writing a TV show called like sweet and not so sweet but like a good her title like I couldn t tell you look at her title yeah sweetened sour no but it was about two girls kind of Batman and Robin style in college exacting revenge on dirt bags okay and it was really it was a funny song that seems like a good role for you honestly it and it was and so I read the script and I go holy A A this is the first time I ve read something that I really A A identify with and could do really naturally and well and so I nobody asked I put myself on tape for it I put my whole heart and soul into this thing instead of like slating my name I did a scene from it where this girl s driving around eating gummy worms and scream singing Alanis Morissette so that was my slate and then you know I do this whole thing and it was like quite frankly one of the best auditions I ve ever done no one had asked for it and I didn t know how to get it seen so I went online and I found her on Facebook the writer the creator of it and I just messaged her on Facebook I said hey man here s a fart in the wind I m a writer I read a lot of Pilots because I want to know what s going on I really A A identified with yours I m also an actress I know you didn t ask and no pressure to watch this whatsoever but I got ta shoot my shot here s my audition tape wow I mean you got to make your dreams become things and that s the way to go about it and you know you can do that a million times and no one will respond to you yeah but it only takes the once I always say and that s what she A A said to me when she responded to me she said hi Lizzy it only takes one person to open a door for you and I I like your audition tape I m gon na submit you to Casting and I got a call back and I went to a producer session wow the producer session was for a different role um I mean it doesn t matter it doesn t matter that s the closest I ve ever gotten besides booking you know what I mean and the show I don t think ever get sweet and vicious sweet vicious who knows um anyways she did that and it was A A cool yeah she didn t know me she didn t know me A A she just did that and then another time I my dog went viral on Instagram Mr bubs as you all know and she made a movie on Netflix called someone great and went through the trouble of A A finding us and making us an offer for money to put Mr bubs s Clip In Her movie and they paid us for his clip and did you take bubs to no they just they they licensed I love the clip okay wow yeah so we love her honestly and I love that story like I love that you like manifested that if you see something you want you have to go for it like when I was searching for entertainment news jobs I would walk my reel into like I think it s so unheard of to like go to a physical building and be like here s my A A give it to your executive producer yeah and that s how I got my job at clever like I did it six months later they had seen something else and they re like that s that guy that walked in and handed us a real I got another audition book the job was there for like four years yeah so like you got to make things happen for yourself because nobody else is going to do it clearly no agent wants us nobody A A wants us oh that s not true what you got an agent do home no not well it s not not it s not as untrue as it once was hold on standby we ll get there but I do want to say this woman is one of the co writers of Thor god of love and thunder which I thought was so A A fun and she also had a movie come out on Netflix uh her second movie on Netflix called do Revenge with Uma Thurman s daughter and the raven haired beauty from Riverdale and it s A A good wow I really enjoyed every second of it and she s got she s obviously got a style she s got a really fun voice that I don t get to see a lot of and it s something that gives me hope for my weird A A yeah and you know if you haven t seen do Revenge see A A do revenge and support this woman because she s a good A A person um what do we say oh another manifestation so I told you I want to get into commercial directing right yeah I want to get into commercial directing because a majority of the people who are kind to me and who don t hate me are in commercials right so one of my favorite DPS I think I mentioned this on the podcast already one of my favorite DPS that I work with regularly um said he would shoot a sample spec for me and I m in product pre production on that project now we have a casting director we have a location I have a unit production manager all these people who by the way I work with on set regularly have come to support me for free because that s how nice I am on set to be around that s how much they love me I don t doubt that you re very fun and good but I m saying like for people to gather around and support me without being paid means I m probably not a Kant on set well I think we cut the thing that had alluded to that anyways regardless I m gon na vouch for myself here right now in case we didn t cut that one specific part all right but anyways uh so then I reached out to a director that I had script supervisored for who I really really like his work he s very funny I love his narrative stuff I love his commercial stuff I like how he is on set he s a A A good guy and I said uh I remember his storyboards being super clean and I I said what program do you use to make your storyboards he said oh I just sketching myself and I ll go oh we got some clean lines dude he s like what s up and I was like oh I m shooting a spec commercial with Matt and he goes good for you I didn t know you want to do commercial directing and it s like I I want a family and money and I will do anything creatively that I can to get that because I m unemployable in the real world and so he says hold on let me connect let me connect you to my talent agency wow to my creative agency and I go oh how would you how should I package myself for them he s like no need I ll set up a general meeting for you right now I have a meeting tomorrow on Tuesday no wow yeah that s incredible yeah it is and so what are you gon na take you should take something um it s over Zoom so I have to bring nothing and I oh that was the other funny thing I so they reached out really quickly to me he has a great intro for me which was so nice and then I was like panicking and texting my friends who are employed and I was like how do I respond to this like a normal person who s not desperate and they were like so I sent a little snippet and it s there it s a little too clean like add more personality and I go nobody likes my personality please and then I was like two explanation points count as personality they re like if that s all you got wow I mean if you can get a commercial directing agent that s incredible well and the even cooler thing about this and I have to thank you for it also is this is a specific kind of creative agency and not only do they do narrative content they do commercial content but it s mostly social media accounts so if I shot a commercial for mayonnaise it would air on YouTube and Tick Tock because Instagram and one of the reasons why they are so excited to meet me is because of my presence on the podcast yeah no that is cool yeah I mean thank you you re welcome yeah you re welcome because I did not do this I mean I didn t create this myself either yes you did I I mean yes but I this couldn t fly with me alone I m not a solo no but it could fly with you and someone else like let s be real and I know that a lot of you wish it would but I m A A here to stay A A I will I will baby trap him if I have to okay did you want to talk about blondes at all it s getting a lot of like controversial I A A hated it I turned it off immediately I when you put it on the document I I like Googled it and then I saw there was all this controversy around it then I tried watching it and I got like four minutes in and I was like I m so bored did you make it out of the fire I didn t even make it to the fire wow I don t think I ve watched the first four minutes of it then I think I started a sexual mishap right I apparently this movie is nothing but I don t want to get demonetized I know I mean I think that the whole movie is a sexual and is that assault is that her life I guess because this is what s so A A up this movie is a biopic right Marilyn Monroe allegedly but no it s based off of a fictional book that was written by someone else so yes it s about Marilyn Monroe and a lot of it has to do is founded in fact but it s only based on and inspired by heavily more that there are a lot of narrative fictionalized elements in the book that the movie is based off of but they sell it as if this is fact proof checked it s not and I saw like then I looked at the reviews and I saw a lot of people saying like sexual trauma yeah aside it s just bad that is also true it s A A three hours long we probably was like what and I the pacing of it s whack I m watching these scenes knowing full well this movie is three hours long and thinking cut all of this what and then right after that we re banging into a heavy aggressive tight shot on some essay and I m just like I literally looked at Joe s like turn it off we re done I m not going to sit through that no and yeah that does happen and it s awful and it s horrible but it s like you don t experience it for three hours they reduce this woman to her trauma alone and outside of these and they they diminish her to like a shattered woman who was incapable and clumsily fell into this because she s so sexualizable right and it s just like no like Marilyn Monroe did some cool A A for a woman in that era yeah she started a production company when women weren t doing that like talk about the A A that she did do and instead it s like all literally reduced to horrific trauma that took away every like they don t talk about her wit and her charm her comedic timing her work ethic any of that it s just all something that s just like falling into her lap because she s just so vulnerable I won t go back to it I m sick of it already I also heard there s two shots that go inside her vagina yuck and to be completely honest those are the only things that I m like I would like to know what that looks like not the inside of her vagina but I want to know how a man chose to shoot going inside a vagiji well let us know report back honestly I will um the last two things I wanted to talk about were just some TV shows have you been following Dahmer at all I love it you do I love it it I guess it s the highest rated new original series that Netflix has ever had it s the best thing that Ryan Murphy has not A A up wow it s really good I really loved Hollywood of his I loved it so much uh this was a little too slow for me and I like felt outside of myself because everywhere I looked everyone was raving about it and I was like am I like what s wrong with me because I felt like it just never got moving and then so I kept going back it took me like four times going back to the second episode to finish the second episode and then I found like a new appreciation for it in the third episode and that s where I m at now is it the end of the third episode oh I literally could not stop watching it wow I m obsessed I mean everyone is and everyone s talking about like how hot Jeffrey Dahmer is and how I don t get that I don t get that I feel like he s being heavily sexualized well that s insane yeah that s insane that s insane did you see that it was listed as like lgbtq plus content and the community reached out and said please don t how can they say that though like I mean they did a serial killer right and yet they don t blame him whatever I have two countries you can t choose who you want to claim if it s a gay like if you searched gay on Netflix it should pop up he s a gay serial killer yeah people are too much yeah I m sorry I don t care come at me um I honestly was more enthralled by the patient on Hulu and FX the patient yeah with Steve Carell where he s there get into it and his patient kidnaps yeah that s so you I got so much more invested into that and it s like Can t Take My Eyes Off of it I feel like you re like one hissy fit away from pulling the same killing people never like kidnapping your therapist and chaining them up in your basement I could see you doing that and then Super rationalizing it and being really apologetic but also being smart enough to know you can never release him what my alarm s going off and it s reminding me to get Swisher s monster mask and hands I don t know what any of that is but I think that is the Perfect Cue to end the show I do too all right you guys thank you so much for hanging out with us and watching today s

orange theory weight class for the first time ever today i was afraid that i was going to not have enough food in my body my body to record the podcast so i shoved my face with so much food what food just so much but what was the food i made i had leftovers from my hello fresh meal i made a protein shake i shoved my face with some almonds i just didn t stop eating but now i feel like i need to give birth you ever did it i overdid it but i think like the mixture of like heavy lifting and the guy was like you know you never want to be embarrassed when you re in a class full of people and he tells you to go for the heavy weight so you re a psycho he al rylan goes too hard i go for the pound dumbbell to do like some crazy overhead movements and i think i also tweaked my back so i m just

stocking you ll know kim kardashian when it s kim A A kardashian what do you mean okay remember last year when she showed up and nobody could see her face we still knew it was A A kim i don t know if chris knew chris knew he filmed that episode okay what did kim kardashian wear at the met gala last year chris you die if you answer wrong all black stuff chris lives to see another barbecue okay lizzy rang in her nd birthday yes i did over the past week in fact i did we had lots of wonderful celebrations yes experts would say i m exhausted from joy oh my gosh me too overwhelmed and not just the joy from your party but i was like the most social i ve ever been in my life this past weekend what else i need a break maybe that s what s going on what else did you do well a friend had me over for dinner oh that s right on friday his other friend had him over for dinner the other night apparently he was up very late with her living his best life we stayed up until am just talking about the world and how it works and lucy couldn t be more jealous so glad you have other friends i showed up to the birthday top party happy on time healthy cute in support yeah some would say i predict well actually all of your friends are pretty good at art do you want to experience oh my birthday was we went to color me mine and i had requested that all of my friends paint a mug for me to drink my morning coffee out of which is very cute because you wanted to keep it low key and casual yeah it was like a daytime first date but because you use a mug every day yeah it s like you can go and be reminded and it sparks joy for me i will say this when i walked in there were balloons set up everywhere and there was like a barricade over the back section of the shop and i was like oh my god i don t think i even told them it was my birthday like how did they know and i was like did you guys do this for me and they went no it s a four year old s birthday party in the back today and her mother did that for her and i said oh and then the four year olds were screaming and they were screaming and like playing with squigger toys which was nuts when they left they brought me the decorations that i got their trash and then their trash decorated my party until they asked us to leave yeah and if i was feeling better i d really pick an issue with you but i just don t know what s the issue just pick the issue no last year it was a scandal here how you don t like cake and how we didn t eat your cake and how i got mad about that which you said you don t even like cake and you show up to your birthday party with cupcakes they re different they re not different i like a chocolate cupcake with a chocolate frosting and a rainbow sprinkle that s the same as cake different if you got the same combination as cake it s literally cake it s different it s not it is if i go to susie cake do you want me to call susie cake right now let s order another cake no you know what i think this would be an adventure that we could go on together are we gon na go to susie cakes pack it up chris we re hitting the road i was gon na call and say is your recipe for cupcakes any different than your recipe for cakes call and ask actually well you re out of luck because they closed minutes or am i in luck yeah because you d be proven wrong and then the internet would have to take back all the drama that they stirred last year honestly weird drama to pick up on for real i can t even you want to know some real tea here s the A A hot goss oh oh my husband forgot to A A give me a birthday cake with candles for me to blow out because all all i want to do is make a A A wish okay and this A A multiple days in a row was like don t worry like i didn t forget it s like then where s my cake because i micromanaged this kitchen and i see no cake and you are not a sneaky man and multiple times he s like i have to go out to make sure the lizma s vibe is right it s like well you A A it up because where s the cake dude and then i bought the candles for it at susie cakes when we got those cupcakes and nobody s saying happy birthday to me at my birthday party even though we had the A A cupcakes for it and the A A candles for it and the A A napkins for it then i get home and it s like i m expecting it after my A A dinner and joe literally forgot it and says don t worry it s gon na happen and then last night i had had bad enough and when after we had dinner which i made i went into his office and i said can i please have my birthday cake now with the song and the candles and was it the cupcakes no it was like a a plethora of things like two fruit tarts and like a flourless chocolate cake and a piece of a brownie and did you take a photo no of course you didn t what good are you and i also forgot to even make a wish because honestly at that point i was so exhausted from having to demand my A A moment that i blew out one candle i was like i forgot to make a wish and then they related the candle and then i made a wish but it was you know what i know i hear how i sound and let me just say i m so tired and we are not afternoon girls well that s what we ve both come to the conclusion we are morning A A miss me with the nighttime recordings it s like nothing happens good for me after pm i almost fell asleep with the wheel on my way here it was like like girl i m tired okay well she s had a day where do we even go from here where do we go from here i ve never been more awake really what s wrong with you turn him back chris is normally like stumbling in here tell us about it yeah chris is normally stumbling in i m a night owl yeah i can t do mornings i mean i do them for work but i m tired did you how did you get here today where did you by way which way did you come from i came from bakersfield today of course you did because you live there now on the weekends yeah i hope for the barbecue business right for your non boyfriend for his not boyfriend anyways i m sorry it s okay no need to apologize do you have anything else from your past week um seems like nothing s happening with us oh you can do this one you wanted me to put that on here what can you not read no well then try i don t know any people okay you ll know cameron well i forgot to talk to you about my mug for lizzy i was really planning this i knew in advance that her birthday party was going to be us making her a mug so i really thought about it i prayed on it and did you really yes for real i was thinking about my god please make clear to me what i should paint on this mug for my friend lizzy and as i was driving terminology just hit me in the face and it s actually something i d never referred to god rang down from heaven above and shouted at me a message of joy and wonderment he said ryland on this day the th of april you will make a mug for lizzie gordon that says well you know just say what it says oh my gosh i need to preface it because you guys came to the conclusion in our comment section that sometimes she looks like a lesbian and it s debatable that conclusion oh you by reading the comments and relaying the information to me yeah but you call me what on earth leslie liz yeah but then as i was playing i was like oh i m gon na hit her with a cup that reads leslie liz i m gon na put her in her mouth leslie outfit like on the side of the cup and then as i was driving into color me mine the term butch babe hit me and i thought oh my god couldn t be better so one side says butch babe in the center it s a picture of lizzie les lezzy liz dressed like a working A A foot locker it s a referee outfit because it was the easiest for me to execute with my artistic abilities i ll show it on screen i mean we don t have the finished product once it s glazed it s going to be truly sickening but you ll get to see the unfinished look but while we were at lunch breakfast what were we doing while we were painting we were just painting while we were painting joe and this is where you take over oh well i mean joe just pointed we here s the deal i was having a discussion with my husband joseph in our bed before our bedtime we were watching the three hour and minute film called jfk by oliver stone not the documentary the scripted song okay as we are watching it we were commentating on the fact that for some reason history has tried to force down our gullets that jackie onassis was an a woman of great beauty but when you really look at jackie onassis you think is A A so i m gon na ask you to sound off in the comments below go ahead and google the iconic woman and let me know if you think she s actually stunning sickening or whatever or is she just sort of like an average jane jackie onassis i m just gon na ask you if you care about anyone else no okay anyways i m laying in bed with my A A husband we re talking about hot the fact that there s not really been any like stunning visually stunning first ladies and then i said but hillary clinton s hot as A A and he said that that was pretty gay that s the story that s the gayest thing you ve ever said for sure like and this was all coming to fruition as i was painting my leslie liz cup i never felt more validated in my life i also had to google if the term butch was acceptable for me to be painting on a cup to then have uh polished and frozen by one of the employees that color me mine i think your use of the word butch is less offensive than me considering hillary clinton to be a hot woman yeah i don t know where you came to that conclusion have you seen her i mean she could when we get into the met gal looks girl is snatched on that carpet tonight why is she at the mexican she is glowing is her husband by her side i don t think so she looked like she was writing solo and you re and then joe came in with a good point he just said oh no lizzy s attracted to her what was that i think it was like megalomania which like he s not wrong he s not wrong i m aware that she is there s a need for control and power right like i don t love hillary clinton like i love jesus you know what i mean like it s a different kind of love it s like a warm moist pulsating between your legs kind of thing and like i wasn t familiar with jackie kennedy s work but i would say that i would uh prefer to uh fornicate her more than hillary okay yeah i don t know if hillary s my cup of tea like in the terms of like me turning straight for someone right let me google her she s not everyone s cup of tea but she is mine all right well i know it s been so fun but we do have an ad for today s episode

nikki okay just nikki i love nikki okay chris before well should we do our matt gala review let s wait until we can find kim let s give her some time to show no i mean we have like looks to review let s wait let s do iced tea really fast i think we have that grade of iced tea i think we have some good iced tea in here what just happened today come on think about it well i m not prepared for this moment why it s right here i was prepared to go into mecca of fashion why does it mean jesus christ i m gon na die why does it matter just go here go to ic give him a minute to show up do you really want to talk about kim kardashian doesn t show up yet this is the kim kardashian hour well everybody wants to know whether or not she s showing up in one of the dresses that marilyn monroe wore originally that can t be altered at all so if she doesn t fit in it she doesn t make it to the A A show i wan na know okay okay elon musk bought twitter he did it it went through and to my knowledge it went through right their reporting is yeah it went through i don t know if like the power has been transferred i think the purchase has been done um i don t know when he goes into power he steps into his power the whole world is so when his horocrats has become official so angry and honestly it just is so funny to me watch everyone be so upset over something literally i know and people are saying like it could end world hunger and to my knowledge elon musk the amount of money that he spent they say could end world hunger which i don t know why he s responsible to do that like i don t know why one is exclusive with the other a lot of people just don t like elon musk because they think that like hillary he s a megalomaniac is this her which might not be right i can t see that part davidson yeah oh my god give it to me oh my god is she wearing the marilyn monroe dress oh my gosh see i didn t recognize her i recognize pete i think she is wearing the marilyn monroe dress we ve got a screen record so that they can see what s going on okay well she s just standing right now pete s giving a peace sign oh my gosh no there she is there she is yeah i think that s the marilyn monroe dress wow she did go blonde did she dye her hair like that or is that just a sickening wig wow and the fur coat oh my gosh it s slinky and tight in all the right places okay wow she really showed up to do the dance and they couldn t alter the dress because it s an arc it s a it s like a relic a historical relic and did marilyn monroe approve of kim kardashian marilyn monroe is so dead are you serious i m saying though like how who is in charge of her estate that approves of kim kardashian i think the dress was at ripley s believe it or not in florida so no one in association with maryland had a choice in the matter i m pretty sure whoever owns the dress how to say in the matter okay because i was going to say what do you mean like i could just say like i want to wear marilyn monroe s get up wow this is it for pete davidson and then he is a lucky man is this katy perry looking in like the knockout i don t think that s katy perry okay that was definitely not katy perry wow i mean she looks stunning it s like so kim kardashian takes marilyn monroe s happy birthday mr president dress out for a spin so that s the dress oh my god this is so full circle to the fact that i was talking about jackie onassis slash kennedy whatever so the t is marilyn monroe was A A both john f kennedy and robert f kennedy who were in fact brothers at the time of her passing is this a fact this is a fact this is well known in history i m not breaking this gossip there s no way that i know who the A A the kennedy brothers were A A i know there s all in the s aren t there all these rumors like supposedly she was absolutely A A both of them at the same time anyways she s wearing the dress that marilyn wore when she sang the sexy happy birthday mr president i can t get over this this is a A A moment like this is A A crazy i mean i don t really i m not like living for the historical moment because i don t recall her in the gown maryland but looking at this it is like elegant stunning like old hollywood fashion it fits her in all the right places it s like slinky and perfect at the bottom it s nude but it sparkles it s like and she is the marilyn of our generation if you really think about it i mean she s not an actress but yes was marilyn an actress i don t know i did i didn t live in that time period and you know she was she was an actor she was an actress but she was also an iconic sex symbol okay and kim is nothing if not an iconic sex symbol of course yeah so i would say that thematically though kim is not technically an actress even though she does have an extensive list of acting credits including but not limited to like csi i think i might be making that up regardless kim is the maryland of our generation and i think it s A A dope that she went in her A A dress that is everything well we ll get back to you on if she s the best dressed of the night i don t know if she s the best dress but i do have to say like that is like well i m saying after we read and review right no but i mean we re going to come to the conclusion yeah i just think it s A A sick as A A yeah yeah wow um anyways elon bought twitter and that s that oh but nobody what back to the elon just to go back to it we were talking about how he s a megalomaniac and people don t like him because he s kind of a douche weegle but he s also doing douche wiggles the thing that people say so here s the thing like well here s the thing bezos bought a A A press thing too i m pretty sure bezos owns the washington post i m probably wrong about that he owns some sort of newspaper and so when elon musk goes out and buys the A A site where all the publications are listed first and people go to seek the news it s like that s just one step smarter than what everybody else has always done yeah and i saw a lot of people leaving twitter and i was like does this mean twitter will be a place that will be bearable because honestly it s the but he s also promoting uh the opposite of that but i did see a lot of people just saying like i m deactivating my account they re gon na be back in five and a half seconds A A cares and i just thought it could be fun to like reopen my twitter because i haven t honestly been there in two years and i deleted my twitter because so many verified people were being so nasty to me at a certain point in life so i was thinking it d be fun to see who s being nasty to me now yeah i think that s toxic i don t know that i would like to stand by you whilst do you do that because it seems very awkward maybe they re being nice now who knows i doubt that that s the case or maybe i m twitter are you now are you claiming the same audience as elon musk no no i m not but i just think it s fun like i ve always thought twitter was so toxic even when i was on twitter so i don t think anything s going to make twitter a better place to exist because it is the place where you just get to spew your thoughts and jump on anything that s like starting to gain traction good or bad yeah so it s never a place i want to be regardless of who owns it but i did hear and it could be false that elon musk went to the who and said i i m willing to uh give you six billion dollars if you give me a plan on how you re going to utilize it right to uh i think it was in regards to hunger so i don t know or maybe he s the monster or the world s biggest devil and i just don t know about it i definitely think that there s a big reason why people feel so strongly that they do i think i don t know it because i spend most of my time not looking up important information yeah and i would say i play a lot of tetris and that s what i m the majority of my mental space is occupied with just how to fit simple shapes into each other but if i don t do it who will so you don t want to see who s mentioning me on twitter no interesting i don t i ve never been a person who understands how to A A with twitter because oh is this what you wanted to do well yeah because the you know on twitter isn t go ahead open it well i don t even know if it gets uncomfortable i m not going to look at you though i m so sorry in advance if it s hateful and if anybody s hating on me they can go A A munch a rug why would they come here they could munch my rug which by the way is something i m trying to coin i m coining the phrase munch my rug instead of suck my dick um i don t even know if i can get into my twitter honestly thank god do i have a seven what we might have to come back to this after the break oh no i don t know how to get into my twitter this is what happens when i produce a podcast okay olivia wilde was served with papers on stage at some sort of it wasn t comic con but it comes no it was like i think it was called cinecon and she was giving a talk on stage because she s a director and she s a movie talking about the film starring harry styles yeah and she gets served with papers from ex jason sedakis i mean technically it was just like the guy that was hired to give her the court papers which can t be jason but she does have to receive them so kind of brilliant to give it to her when she s scheduled to speak in public a lot of legal analysis though really dark and A A up but a lot of legal analysis are saying that you you typically know when the papers are being served and that it s like very unlikely that he didn t know that it was happening at such a public forum i was just like A A your A A he released a statement saying he didn t know that that was happening after receiving a ton of backlash online so we ll honestly never know i just think the plot thickens so much because it s so interesting and fascinating that saturday night live has now announced that harry styles will be the musical act for jason sedakis when he hosts the show on may that makes my stomach turn and so are that he s in on it a little bit or like that makes me sick with anxiety i can t believe they would do that to both of those guys like that is they they like the we just watched this on the kardashians it seems like kim had a saying and she s like should i have kanye be my musical guest it s like shouldn t we definitely not put these two guys together at this time and if jason s having to serve olivia with paperwork it means that he doesn t have access to her correct no legally when you when someone s being served i like if i sued you i could not personally hand you the papers but why has to be a third party but if he s at the point of suing her then sorry for her child he was he it s uh custody business i believe i know but that means that they were not able to come to a conclusion right on their own so he s having to sue her so the fact that he is going to be on snl with harry styles to me i mean this serving situation seems like it s not all amicable oh obviously the fact that they re coinciding in this i mean is a ratings gold but what if they get in a huge fight live i mean is olivia not going to be there to support her new man while he has to encounter if i were her i would steer very clear of that event i would not attend and if i were one of those dudes i would be like oh excuse me guys i believe there s been an oversight and you happen to have paired me with uh the man who s A A my former wife like i would not want that stark seems tragic all around yeah it s uncomfortable we got ta cut and we ll be right back scene one take two marker well in a shocking turn of events a couple of silly geese fell for a fake headline it was on my explore page and it was like this is indeed real and nice and there were like multiple slides and like showing proof that it was posted so how did it how did the fakeness come about well first we have to say jason sedakis and harry styles not going to be on snl together that was just a joke people posted a joke headline and we read it and we re like wow this is wild and that s why it s a joke because it s so blatantly obviously funny because it could never happen because that would be although can you imagine the highest ratings in the show s history for sure maybe they should do it so we don t look like A A morons yeah and honestly this is i m going to call laura michaels and be like hey lauren like my friend rylan and i this is why tiktok and instagram are so toxic because you can just put out whatever the A A you want and stupid people like me believe it and i m like did you hear with such conviction and then i m speculating on how awkward this is and why olivia was surfing the paper like this can t be real like we got daddy goes that can t be real let me actually look into it it s not i don t deserve this i literally feel like i m going oh my god don t do it hold it together i feel so nauseous like i feel like don t talk about it unless you re gon na be about it jump outside i i might need that trash can honestly i wonder what s going on with me are you sick sick i don t know like i feel so ill what did you what were the leftovers i can t even focus are you gon na throw up should i leave it s pat like it it s passing it s passing no but i still need that in case it comes back you need to give me enough warning to get out of here because if you start doing that i m gon na have to i just i m so sorry for them more than you i feel like it s about to come out both ends quite frankly do you have the norovirus is that what this is if you start A A and vomiting yeah probably i feel like that s what s going on and now i ve given it to you i m not good with norovirus i thought for a second the i wasn t feeling well the other night and so i took a covered test last night and i didn t i don t have covid so maybe i have something else and i shouldn t be by you guys if it s a norovirus i will literally A A kill maybe you should run now if i honest to god my dog is so sick if i am if i wind up laid up on the toilet A A and vomiting my brains out right now i will set your entire A A house on fire i told you i was not well before you came yeah but you re never well you always say i m unwell how am i supposed to take you so you re the boy who cried on well i m yeah but i m like lightheaded feeling like i m going to barf with something about to fall out of my ass oh fall out like it s not even gon na need like a push like it s just gon na drop i can t laugh right now don t laugh right now i m so sad on our met gala review do you want to just speed through it as fast as we can and then call it a short one well no what i love i love doing the met gal once let s try and then if you start shifting and vomiting i ll just A A dip okay let s quickly get to the the kardashians what the A A was kim wearing before she was going to snl she was in a full neon pink ski outfit as though she was hitting the slopes in aspen colorado yeah but she was standing in her hotel room and she changed before she got paparazzi to go to snl yeah so she was wearing that to film the kardashians and i just couldn t fathom what she was doing i couldn t tell you i mean she s the fashion icon so yeah i ll leave it up to her honestly we all thought they were batshit crazy when they were wearing sweats and bralettes and now like look at us out in these streets and sweats and bralettes so catch me next season in a A A aspen jacket ready to hit the slopes even though i haven t done that since the s do you know what i m talking about of course you re talking about and it was right when kanye was delivering the he got the rest of the video and i watched it and it s like not sex and it s like so what did he get you and why does it matter as if it also doesn t exist on a cloud somewhere though like nobody has footage only existing on one device like it was a computer and a hard drive kanye s like i got rid of the club and chris is like can we bring the cameras and she s like yeah bring the cameras as if this wasn t planned i i feel bad for the woman like i know she doesn t want to relive this with her children and do it all over again and i m glad that she went through the trouble of like securing the bag but like sounds like the bag might have might have not been a thing which also might be why ray j s like it s not a thing yeah he started commenting on all of yeah he s like it s not a sexy well in the show she s like oh it s no more sex and kanye s saying he flew commercial for this i love that they keep saying that like he s like a A A hero i flew with regular people but like he s like sick by it and he s like i had to sit by poor people i flew couch but like what was that he s like private plane catch kanye on spirit airlines like whoa no but why couldn t he charter his jet and why couldn t he charter oh my god why couldn t he charter kim s chat like this i don t know i just don t understand i and you know what i don t care and then i was thinking more about the amy schumer collaboration i think it s a plug for life after beth which is just like the slowest A A show well i started thinking yeah because you were so confused by the merging of the two and then i vocalized it out loud while shane was in the room and he goes they re cross promoting for her life of beth show oh and i thought oh my gosh oh wow everything makes sense now because she showed up she s product please imagine she is product placement it s A A i don t know i don t doubt they have text conversations but there s no world in which kim s like thanks for the advice i m taking none of it thanks amy you re truly one of my best friends if it wasn t planted by hulu so i just thought it was a weird interesting plant yeah um do you feel manipulated because honestly i watched life of beth and i couldn t tell you much about it but i do have to say that amy i am starting to realize amy schumer s brand of humor yeah i mean she definitely is funny like i i mean i m realizing what it is what do you mean i m i m understanding her tone and her voice i m not laughing but i i do see her and i hear her i do hear her i hear her voice what she brings is funny to me like i watched her last appearance on the ellen degeneres show and i thought it like she brings it like yeah and i appreciate her bringing strategic bits to thing events such as talk shows because so many people are snorefest on talk shows so i do appreciate what she s giving to the world what did she do on ellen she was just funny she was funnier than the average person i mean she was being amy schumer but like it made me laugh on more than one occasion okay okay um this one was brought to my oh okay there is a verdict in the kardashian verse blac chyna trial which is the kardashians win and owe no money to china the result happened on met gala monday just a few hours ago while china was sitting in the courtroom alone because the kardashians were attending the met gala they re like the verdict isn t even important too because like black giant are you a crazy A A and these women are all at the met gala looking A A a little ridiculous everyone except for kim is looking a little ridiculous and i read that this is something like the trial is five years after the initial lawsuit so i think that s fairly normal i know but it s like to stay passionate and to hope that you could win for five years to take it to trial when the evidence all lined up against her like it all boils down to for me she wouldn t have gotten the reality show if it weren t for the kardashians to begin with so even if they had a big play in canceling the second season of her show she really has no runway to say like this was something i created on my own well that wasn t what she was even trying to say well she was saying the money she lost out on because the show was canceled but i m saying and she s saying the show was canceled because of false claims from the kardashians because that s what defamation is but she also had a restraining order on rob after the first season so it s very likely that the producers would never pick it up to begin with but the the point of the defamation lawsuit like we talked about last week is can if it s true the person is not guilty of defamation so the truth that they proved in court legally on record is that blac chyna is a nasty A A and what i m saying is for her to believe with conviction for five years knowing the facts that she was that she thought she was going to win is what s crazy to me yeah and the kardashians aren t just all gon na show up to court for not like if they didn t think they were gon na win they would have settled and paid her out yeah so it s just ironic i think it s so funny i met gala monday when kim s wearing marilyn monroe s dress because you re legally declared a crazy A A it s just so unfortunate like i feel like a loser on met gal monday so my heart goes out to blac chyna i mean i don t know if that s where you want to start i don t know if that s the wraparound for you but you know what let s he s not saying i guess he s not feeling i literally could pass out at any minute he s barely holding it together do not hold the blac chyna statement against him do you want to get into netflix my hands are temporary so what should we do or do we want to talk about how that that stank ass megan merkel s cartoon was dropped by netflix and so she might have to sell another expose to make her million dollar development deal netflix s q numbers have come out and they re in the negative for the first time ever and they re saying it s not only because they pulled out of russia because everything that s going on but also just because everyone s swapping between streaming services and i think netflix had to cut ties with some of the most expensive projects one being meghan markle s show which i think they signed like a hundred and fifty million dollar deal like a development deal yeah yes so i think them backing out of this show probably saved them probably tens of millions of dollars it was a cartoon it was a child s cartoon show yeah it s like megan nobody wanted this from you but nobody s ever wanted any of the shits you make and your book is stupid and for your children s book is stupid oh my gosh it is anyone who s ready so everyone was team meghan markle and pretending that she wasn t like some kind of sort of villain again like everyone has facets to them and i m sure her narrative has been spun out of control by the media such as every other celebrity so like we never know where she truly lies like evil great probably somewhere in the middle like the rest of it i mean no matter what when that couple was coming out with all of these different jobs that was paying them ten to tens of two hundreds of millions of dollars i just like honestly it left a really bad taste in my mouth because why in the A A would you ever give that much money and development for what product do you know what i mean like what are they developing well they re like what the A A is it because it feels like you re just giving these people money because they re formerly royal of course yeah but they re not doing anything in regards to being formerly right they let the heat die had this show come out a month after everything that was going on when they were at the top of all the headlines the investment you really think a six month old is gon na turn off coco melon to watch megan merkel s pearl well i think it s they re probably looking at like barack obama s series came out which i m sure is wonderful and it was trash i tried to watch it people people didn t watch it so they re probably just realizing like oh our money is better spent in other places like the big names don t necessarily draw in well those are those kinds of big names like who gives a A A about and also like by the way love barack obama i really do i tried to read his autobiography the audacity of hope but it was in his voice in my head so it went really slow and i just couldn t keep going my dad loved that book i m sure and it s a great no i know and i m so pissed because the only reason why i put it down was because i was reading it in barack s voice in his cadence which is very A A slow could not make it through the first chapter that being said i A A love him he s a charismatic bright light in every room put on his nature show because i love a nature show and to be like some shots were so similar that even though he s in a new location it feels like a jump cut like not even your dogs were interested my dogs could give a A A and they love that A A it was wild so it s also like it s barack obama like where did that money go did his daughter shoot this and also she went to documentarian school so she should be better at this oh that s oh it s dark okay um james corden s late night show is being canceled after this upcoming season he s doing one more round and he s announced that he s done so you put this on the document did i add let s make this i added let s make this about us because i don t know why there s not one goddamn person in hollywood that s not watching our podcast thinking that we need a morning show or a late night show no i m not suited for late night i m not oh well no that we recorded during the day even so like i m not of the landscape of late night it s more like one two punch like punchline funny yeah i think we re more suited in like we would have ryan and kelly i don t know if i can deliver that i m telling you i m more like in the scope of ryan and kelly um you don t think we could do like a chelsea handler panel show um i could never i think you re funny you made me laugh recently i don t remember what you said but i do remember no and even i got my friend mal called me after coloring mine and she said rylan s funny thank you mal she said i didn t know he was funny i thought he was just weird and awkward but he s very funny i said no his funny is his weird and awkward well i don t think i m weird or awkward well then you don t know yourself thanks a lot mal learning lots today uh no but i just think like no give us a A A studio audience give us the wendy williams A A show well no i love wendy williams i do not want to replace wendy s no but like give us uh i ll take the time slot leading into or coming after wendy williams yeah but and we can t be live and we re cheap like not we re cheap but the show s not expensive i m affordable i am an affordable talent we re the budget of the show like they have a one time set that they have to build and then it s really like and i do have to say i get a lot of questions from people how big is your production and i say my production is very small what do you mean my production at the sip what i have produced here for you guys is the three of us in ryland s shed it s just me chris and ryland and then i edit every episode and color correct it and i upload it to all the platforms such a hero so what was i doing and adding it like no that is the james cord intro no that i mean it s the end of an era and it s crazy and he s like i see more for myself but typically speaking the people who do these like late late shows and the tonight show and that they do it till death do they part or maybe he s going to go take over for what someone else is well shane was like do you think he s going to take over for ellen and i said well no he has another year he has another year on his contract and then i started thinking well isn t that a downgrade technically from late night to a daytime slot but actually the late night hosts aren t what they once were somebody s calling you um like in terms of ratings and views actually the most popular talk show right now is live with kelly and ryan and they re getting like over million views yeah live but i know james is also like a very talented actor and singer yeah i think he s talented at everything i mean he showcases that on a lot like me yeah so maybe you have a time slot in late night but i don t i think it s been long enough we need to get into the met gala fashion let s get into the mecca faction review i m gon na have to put some cards because i know people are just gon na want to jump right here because i was so in in comprehensive today i just think that you don t realize that every time we re at our worst our show is at its best i don t think so today like my hands are tingling i m gon na pass out every monday no i don t he s always like i can t feel my face like okay let s get into our met gala fashion review it wouldn t be the met gala if we didn t start with the queen herself anna wintour now vogue puts on the event so she is the reigning queen of vogue um it s serving peacock it s serving nena it s serving bird it s serving uh would you like some biscuits and gravy yeah is this vegan is pita going to be okay with this it looks like feathers yeah there s looks like there s feathers on there you know we should have done our due diligence and been like she s wearing blah blah blah so and so and styled by such and such oh no it doesn t say that okay well that s anna wintour glad we covered her i think it s the moment you ve all been waiting for where you get no information about people we don t even know who they are it s age appropriate i like the hairstyle the crown is a lot but i guess she s owning it i think the crown is on theme because the theme this year is yeah serve it too it s a continuation of last year s theme which is probably because it s like could they not think of a new thing ask to ask is that the rest of this episode lexicon of fashion the gilded age oh what even is the met gala gilded glamour met gala will celebrate the second volume in a two part costume institute exhibition exhibition we re fine the first in america lexicon of fashion so the first in america is that why kim is wearing marilyn monroe because she s one of the first icons i think that was the first volume so this is volume two which is gilded glamour i ll never understand what the mech gala is i think guilty glamour is more of like an s sort of vibe which is why you re going to see a lot of people who are dressed a little bit like downton not downton abbey but like what s that other english uh bridgerton um there s mad bridgerton vibes i m just saying you ll see as we progress through the looks i don t think there s a world in which i ll ever retain what the met gala itself is it s a fundraising event for the metropolitan museum of modern art okay there s more to it which i know because last year when we did this someone in the comments was like this is what the A A it is and you guys are stupid and it s like obviously we re stupid we fall for fake news you didn t come here to learn what the A A the met gal is about you came here to listen to two very stupid beautiful people talk about other very stupid beautiful people wow if it isn t a time to be emma chamberlain but do you see the vibe with emma chamberlain here where it s a little bit modern bridge um oh bridge abbreviation yeah and that apparently is the gilded whatever gosh you know chris maybe you should look up what that means guilded guilded something gilded glamour we re good for nothing good for nothing but hot as hell honestly it s never been a better time to be emma chamberlain she s getting better and better so much better so much and it s just as like is she an actual guest this year is she was she a guest last year she well she s a guest but she s also doing she s conducting interviews for the youtube channel which feels very fitting yeah and she s been doing making all of the fashion rounds like she gets invited to everything now because isn t she a model for louis vuitton she s always in collaboration with louis vuitton and one of the other big companies did i just say louis yeah does anyone say louis vuitton i don t know we re gon na go to the next person whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i wasn t done gawking over emma chambers hold on turn my turn mark what is your name chris turn chris on let crispy um yes mark yes um so gilded means to show how wealth and glamour was used to conceal the social unrest and turmoil of the era and what was the era just reading what it says and it stops there i can look further into it what do you mean oh whatever who cares that s what popped up and i just read it i think wow i honestly love emma chamberlain s look i love the short hair she did the same color that kim kardashian did with the hair the platinum blonde and the jewel oh gosh i guess i want to be on a chamberlain yeah interesting and you love her coffee so i m boring is in this all black ensemble serving i am my father s daughter the youth no she s made a name for herself now no she looks like her A A dad oh okay that you mean in terms of that yeah i think the euphoria cast is having a moment right now they re getting invited to just everything i mean i think good for her that s all you have to say about her and you just sucked A A emma chamberlain s rug dry well because i thought emma chamberlain looked good she like took a risk on the record rylan adams thinks mod apatow is trash that s not true i love all epitals including wesley mann um i think this is the boy from no is it not this is no he s not a euphoria boy evan mock evan mock is another hbo max girly he is in the reboot of gossip girl which i found unwatchable okay though he is a cutie patootie i believe he is also a professional skateboarder and maybe a model look at him he looks great fantastic serving banana fantasy i hope he s wearing jeffrey s new palette he s not because what do you mean he is serving banana i mean he s like a banana cream yeah a vanilla pudding a banana cream pie next act like you had more to say what is this who is that jordan roth how do you know who that is no who can you look up who that is this is the least yeah i mean i mean it s wild it s like willy wonka goth you know it s like ursula under the sea he s doing with legs his job because do you know what his job is yes to

just like is there gon na be jared leto s serving my sleep paralysis demon i can t i hate it so much i know that he s done like this is probably a master craft of fashion but it s something i hate no it s definitely sick and i don t think the funk the purpose of the met gala is not to be like functioning glam it s supposed to be this like it s supposed to be A A stupid but i wish it was like this and also took my breath away because it was so sickening i m gon na go ahead and say this takes my breath away and if it was anyone else but jared leto wearing it i wouldn t mock it what s your beauty i think he s a silly goose but if cardi b yeah do you not think jared let us a silly goose jared leto was it like a desert A A getaway when the pandemic hit and came back and was like why is

that he is just truly himself like he ll do whatever he wants and i feel as though he has no qualms about it like i wear pink pants and have nightmares about it right i don t think this man is losing sleep over looking like this and me talking about it no i mean he doesn t know who we are okay janelle monae i think she s serving fabulous realness yeah absolutely i mean sparkly glittery glam it s

just perfectly behind her yeah drooping nicely it s a good drift sebastian stan is your nightmare that is your nightmare look sebastian stan is your sleep paralysis and it s his real life you know what i mean like but he doesn t seem to be having a bad time he never seems to be having he s serving bill blue steel confidence did you watch him promoting tom and pammy no he just is like somebody that he s just he is this photo he did a male witch movie in the early audi s that i thought made him a joke and did not realize and tell pam and tommy that he was an actual successful working actor because of it he just exudes like i have a big penis and i don t want to talk to anybody do you think he has a big penis i don t know because there s a prosthetic in the show but that s the energy he gives or he s making up for the fact that he doesn t like i you ll never know like it s one or the other it s either like he has the biggest dick in the world so like he s untouchable yeah or i don t know yeah oh there she is a burgundy beauty glowing hillary clinton she looks good she s also what yeah snatched to the gods i don t think she s ever going to be with us no she won t die she has

i should be like oh my god well they are brothers i don t know i don t like it i m not sure how they could complete the circle for you though i m unclear on the assignment and i don t know what s

if it s like a designer i love that i wish i could work with i m sure i wish i could be them honestly i do think that they are stunning people yeah and i do have to say i get the jonas brothers more

fell in love with harry styles too i just feel like this sophie turner character isn t real like i feel like her real name i don t know it says sophie turner okay i always thought that might be her

give birth you ever did it i overdid it but i think like the mixture of like heavy lifting and the guy was like you know you never want to be embarrassed when you re in a class full of people and he tells you to go for the heavy weight so you re a psycho he al rylan goes too hard i go for the pound dumbbell to do like some crazy overhead movements and i think i also tweaked my back so i m just not at my best let s go to the joint after this and there s nothing to make you feel worse about yourself than looking at everyone else looking fabulous at the met gala when you weren t even invited i

stefani oh my gosh she s serving not punk rock i didn t even recognize her chris put your headset on also you re the one who has to be watching this for kim oh okay we can t be watching it for kim yeah if we watch this this turns into you watching us react to the carpet without sound which does nothing for anyone this is a job i tasked you and you alone so when kim kardashian shows up screams yeah raise a hand raise a hand what if i don t recognize her i have no words for you if what if you don t recognize her are you A A kidding me you recognize her when her face is covered by a A A black stocking you ll know kim kardashian when it s kim A A kardashian what do you mean okay remember last year when she showed up and nobody could see her face we still knew it was A A kim i don t know if chris knew chris knew he filmed that episode okay what did kim kardashian wear at the met gala last year chris you die if you answer wrong all black stuff chris lives to see another barbecue okay lizzy rang in her nd birthday yes i did over the past week in fact i did we had lots of wonderful celebrations yes experts would say i m exhausted from joy oh my gosh me too overwhelmed and not just the joy from your party but i was like the most social i ve ever been in my life this past weekend what else i need a break maybe that s what s going on what else did you do well a friend had me over for dinner oh that s right on friday his other friend had him over for dinner the other night apparently he was up very late with her living his best life we stayed up until am just talking about the world and how it works and lucy couldn t be more jealous so glad you have other friends i showed up to the birthday top party happy on time healthy cute in support yeah some would say i predict well actually all of your friends are pretty good at art do you want to experience oh my birthday was we went to color me mine and i had requested that all of my friends paint a mug for me to drink my morning coffee out of which is very cute because you wanted to keep it low key and casual yeah it was like a daytime first date but because you use a mug every day yeah it s like you can go and be reminded and it sparks joy for me i will say this when i walked in there were balloons set up everywhere and there was like a barricade over the back section of the shop and i was like oh my god i don t think i even told them it was my birthday like how did they know and i was like did you guys do this for me and they went no it s a four year old s birthday party in the back today and her mother did that for her and i said oh and then the four year olds were screaming and they were screaming and like playing with squigger toys which was nuts when they left they brought me the decorations that i got their trash and then their trash decorated my party until they asked us to leave yeah and if i was feeling better i d really pick an issue with you but i just don t know what s the issue just pick the issue no last year it was a scandal here how you don t like cake and how we didn t eat your cake and how i got mad about that which you said you don t even like cake and you show up to your birthday party with cupcakes they re different they re not different i like a chocolate cupcake with a chocolate frosting and a rainbow sprinkle that s the same as cake different if you got the same combination as cake it s literally cake it s different it s not it is if i go to susie cake do you want me to call susie cake right now let s order another cake no you know what i think this would be an adventure that we could go on together are we gon na go to susie cakes pack it up chris we re hitting the road i was gon na call and say is your recipe for cupcakes any different than your recipe for cakes call and ask actually well you re out of luck because they closed minutes or am i in luck yeah because you d be proven wrong and then the internet would have to take back all the drama that they stirred last year honestly weird drama to pick up on for real i can t even you want to know some real tea here s the A A hot goss oh oh my husband forgot to A A give me a birthday cake with candles for me to blow out because all all i want to do is make a A A wish okay and this A A multiple days in a row was like don t worry like i didn t forget it s like then where s my cake because i micromanaged this kitchen and i see no cake and you are not a sneaky man and multiple times he s like i have to go out to make sure the lizma s vibe is right it s like well you A A it up because where s the cake dude and then i bought the candles for it at susie cakes when we got those cupcakes and nobody s saying happy birthday to me at my birthday party even though we had the A A cupcakes for it and the A A candles for it and the A A napkins for it then i get home and it s like i m expecting it after my A A dinner and joe literally forgot it and says don t worry it s gon na happen and then last night i had had bad enough and when after we had dinner which i made i went into his office and i said can i please have my birthday cake now with the song and the candles and was it the cupcakes no it was like a a plethora of things like two fruit tarts and like a flourless chocolate cake and a piece of a brownie and did you take a photo no of course you didn t what good are you and i also forgot to even make a wish because honestly at that point i was so exhausted from having to demand my A A moment that i blew out one candle i was like i forgot to make a wish and then they related the candle and then i made a wish but it was you know what i know i hear how i sound and let me just say i m so tired and we are not afternoon girls well that s what we ve both come to the conclusion we are morning A A miss me with the nighttime recordings it s like nothing happens good for me after pm i almost fell asleep with the wheel on my way here it was like like girl i m tired okay well she s had a day where do we even go from here where do we go from here i ve never been more awake really what s wrong with you turn him back chris is normally like stumbling in here tell us about it yeah chris is normally stumbling in i m a night owl yeah i can t do mornings i mean i do them for work but i m tired did you how did you get here today where did you by way which way did you come from i came from bakersfield today of course you did because you live there now on the weekends yeah i hope for the barbecue business right for your non boyfriend for his not boyfriend anyways i m sorry it s okay no need to apologize do you have anything else from your past week um seems like nothing s happening with us oh you can do this one you wanted me to put that on here what can you not read no well then try i don t know any people okay you ll know cameron well i forgot to talk to you about my mug for lizzy i was really planning this i knew in advance that her birthday party was going to be us making her a mug so i really thought about it i prayed on it and did you really yes for real i was thinking about my god please make clear to me what i should paint on this mug for my friend lizzy and as i was driving terminology just hit me in the face and it s actually something i d never referred to god rang down from heaven above and shouted at me a message of joy and wonderment he said ryland on this day the th of april you will make a mug for lizzie gordon that says well you know just say what it says oh my gosh i need to preface it because you guys came to the conclusion in our comment section that sometimes she looks like a lesbian and it s debatable that conclusion oh you by reading the comments and relaying the information to me yeah but you call me what on earth leslie liz yeah but then as i was playing i was like oh i m gon na hit her with a cup that reads leslie liz i m gon na put her in her mouth leslie outfit like on the side of the cup and then as i was driving into color me mine the term butch babe hit me and i thought oh my god couldn t be better so one side says butch babe in the center it s a picture of lizzie les lezzy liz dressed like a working A A foot locker it s a referee outfit because it was the easiest for me to execute with my artistic abilities i ll show it on screen i mean we don t have the finished product once it s glazed it s going to be truly sickening but you ll get to see the unfinished look but while we were at lunch breakfast what were we doing while we were painting we were just painting while we were painting joe and this is where you take over oh well i mean joe just pointed we here s the deal i was having a discussion with my husband joseph in our bed before our bedtime we were watching the three hour and minute film called jfk by oliver stone not the documentary the scripted song okay as we are watching it we were commentating on the fact that for some reason history has tried to force down our gullets that jackie onassis was an a woman of great beauty but when you really look at jackie onassis you think is A A so i m gon na ask you to sound off in the comments below go ahead and google the iconic woman and let me know if you think she s actually stunning sickening or whatever or is she just sort of like an average jane jackie onassis i m just gon na ask you if you care about anyone else no okay anyways i m laying in bed with my A A husband we re talking about hot the fact that there s not really been any like stunning visually stunning first ladies and then i said but hillary clinton s hot as A A and he said that that was pretty gay that s the story that s the gayest thing you ve ever said for sure like and this was all coming to fruition as i was painting my leslie liz cup i never felt more validated in my life i also had to google if the term butch was acceptable for me to be painting on a cup to then have uh polished and frozen by one of the employees that color me mine i think your use of the word butch is less offensive than me considering hillary clinton to be a hot woman yeah i don t know where you came to that conclusion have you seen her i mean she could when we get into the met gal looks girl is snatched on that carpet tonight why is she at the mexican she is glowing is her husband by her side i don t think so she looked like she was writing solo and you re and then joe came in with a good point he just said oh no lizzy s attracted to her what was that i think it was like megalomania which like he s not wrong he s not wrong i m aware that she is there s a need for control and power right like i don t love hillary clinton like i love jesus you know what i mean like it s a different kind of love it s like a warm moist pulsating between your legs kind of thing and like i wasn t familiar with jackie kennedy s work but i would say that i would uh prefer to uh fornicate her more than hillary okay yeah i don t know if hillary s my cup of tea like in the terms of like me turning straight for someone right let me google her she s not everyone s cup of tea but she is mine all right well i know it s been so fun but we do have an ad for today s episode

nikki okay just nikki i love nikki okay chris before well should we do our matt gala review let s wait until we can find kim let s give her some time to show no i mean we have like looks to review let s wait let s do iced tea really fast i think we have that grade of iced tea i think we have some good iced tea in here what just happened today come on think about it well i m not prepared for this moment why it s right here i was prepared to go into mecca of fashion why does it mean jesus christ i m gon na die why does it matter just go here go to ic give him a minute to show up do you really want to talk about kim kardashian doesn t show up yet this is the kim kardashian hour well everybody wants to know whether or not she s showing up in one of the dresses that marilyn monroe wore originally that can t be altered at all so if she doesn t fit in it she doesn t make it to the A A show i wan na know okay okay elon musk bought twitter he did it it went through and to my knowledge it went through right their reporting is yeah it went through i don t know if like the power has been transferred i think the purchase has been done um i don t know when he goes into power he steps into his power the whole world is so when his horocrats has become official so angry and honestly it just is so funny to me watch everyone be so upset over something literally i know and people are saying like it could end world hunger and to my knowledge elon musk the amount of money that he spent they say could end world hunger which i don t know why he s responsible to do that like i don t know why one is exclusive with the other a lot of people just don t like elon musk because they think that like hillary he s a megalomaniac is this her which might not be right i can t see that part davidson yeah oh my god give it to me oh my god is she wearing the marilyn monroe dress oh my gosh see i didn t recognize her i recognize pete i think she is wearing the marilyn monroe dress we ve got a screen record so that they can see what s going on okay well she s just standing right now pete s giving a peace sign oh my gosh no there she is there she is yeah i think that s the marilyn monroe dress wow she did go blonde did she dye her hair like that or is that just a sickening wig wow and the fur coat oh my gosh it s slinky and tight in all the right places okay wow she really showed up to do the dance and they couldn t alter the dress because it s an arc it s a it s like a relic a historical relic and did marilyn monroe approve of kim kardashian marilyn monroe is so dead are you serious i m saying though like how who is in charge of her estate that approves of kim kardashian i think the dress was at ripley s believe it or not in florida so no one in association with maryland had a choice in the matter i m pretty sure whoever owns the dress how to say in the matter okay because i was going to say what do you mean like i could just say like i want to wear marilyn monroe s get up wow this is it for pete davidson and then he is a lucky man is this katy perry looking in like the knockout i don t think that s katy perry okay that was definitely not katy perry wow i mean she looks stunning it s like so kim kardashian takes marilyn monroe s happy birthday mr president dress out for a spin so that s the dress oh my god this is so full circle to the fact that i was talking about jackie onassis slash kennedy whatever so the t is marilyn monroe was A A both john f kennedy and robert f kennedy who were in fact brothers at the time of her passing is this a fact this is a fact this is well known in history i m not breaking this gossip there s no way that i know who the A A the kennedy brothers were A A i know there s all in the s aren t there all these rumors like supposedly she was absolutely A A both of them at the same time anyways she s wearing the dress that marilyn wore when she sang the sexy happy birthday mr president i can t get over this this is a A A moment like this is A A crazy i mean i don t really i m not like living for the historical moment because i don t recall her in the gown maryland but looking at this it is like elegant stunning like old hollywood fashion it fits her in all the right places it s like slinky and perfect at the bottom it s nude but it sparkles it s like and she is the marilyn of our generation if you really think about it i mean she s not an actress but yes was marilyn an actress i don t know i did i didn t live in that time period and you know she was she was an actor she was an actress but she was also an iconic sex symbol okay and kim is nothing if not an iconic sex symbol of course yeah so i would say that thematically though kim is not technically an actress even though she does have an extensive list of acting credits including but not limited to like csi i think i might be making that up regardless kim is the maryland of our generation and i think it s A A dope that she went in her A A dress that is everything well we ll get back to you on if she s the best dressed of the night i don t know if she s the best dress but i do have to say like that is like well i m saying after we read and review right no but i mean we re going to come to the conclusion yeah i just think it s A A sick as A A yeah yeah wow um anyways elon bought twitter and that s that oh but nobody what back to the elon just to go back to it we were talking about how he s a megalomaniac and people don t like him because he s kind of a douche weegle but he s also doing douche wiggles the thing that people say so here s the thing like well here s the thing bezos bought a A A press thing too i m pretty sure bezos owns the washington post i m probably wrong about that he owns some sort of newspaper and so when elon musk goes out and buys the A A site where all the publications are listed first and people go to seek the news it s like that s just one step smarter than what everybody else has always done yeah and i saw a lot of people leaving twitter and i was like does this mean twitter will be a place that will be bearable because honestly it s the but he s also promoting uh the opposite of that but i did see a lot of people just saying like i m deactivating my account they re gon na be back in five and a half seconds A A cares and i just thought it could be fun to like reopen my twitter because i haven t honestly been there in two years and i deleted my twitter because so many verified people were being so nasty to me at a certain point in life so i was thinking it d be fun to see who s being nasty to me now yeah i think that s toxic i don t know that i would like to stand by you whilst do you do that because it seems very awkward maybe they re being nice now who knows i doubt that that s the case or maybe i m twitter are you now are you claiming the same audience as elon musk no no i m not but i just think it s fun like i ve always thought twitter was so toxic even when i was on twitter so i don t think anything s going to make twitter a better place to exist because it is the place where you just get to spew your thoughts and jump on anything that s like starting to gain traction good or bad yeah so it s never a place i want to be regardless of who owns it but i did hear and it could be false that elon musk went to the who and said i i m willing to uh give you six billion dollars if you give me a plan on how you re going to utilize it right to uh i think it was in regards to hunger so i don t know or maybe he s the monster or the world s biggest devil and i just don t know about it i definitely think that there s a big reason why people feel so strongly that they do i think i don t know it because i spend most of my time not looking up important information yeah and i would say i play a lot of tetris and that s what i m the majority of my mental space is occupied with just how to fit simple shapes into each other but if i don t do it who will so you don t want to see who s mentioning me on twitter no interesting i don t i ve never been a person who understands how to A A with twitter because oh is this what you wanted to do well yeah because the you know on twitter isn t go ahead open it well i don t even know if it gets uncomfortable i m not going to look at you though i m so sorry in advance if it s hateful and if anybody s hating on me they can go A A munch a rug why would they come here they could munch my rug which by the way is something i m trying to coin i m coining the phrase munch my rug instead of suck my dick um i don t even know if i can get into my twitter honestly thank god do i have a seven what we might have to come back to this after the break oh no i don t know how to get into my twitter this is what happens when i produce a podcast okay olivia wilde was served with papers on stage at some sort of it wasn t comic con but it comes no it was like i think it was called cinecon and she was giving a talk on stage because she s a director and she s a movie talking about the film starring harry styles yeah and she gets served with papers from ex jason sedakis i mean technically it was just like the guy that was hired to give her the court papers which can t be jason but she does have to receive them so kind of brilliant to give it to her when she s scheduled to speak in public a lot of legal analysis though really dark and A A up but a lot of legal analysis are saying that you you typically know when the papers are being served and that it s like very unlikely that he didn t know that it was happening at such a public forum i was just like A A your A A he released a statement saying he didn t know that that was happening after receiving a ton of backlash online so we ll honestly never know i just think the plot thickens so much because it s so interesting and fascinating that saturday night live has now announced that harry styles will be the musical act for jason sedakis when he hosts the show on may that makes my stomach turn and so are that he s in on it a little bit or like that makes me sick with anxiety i can t believe they would do that to both of those guys like that is they they like the we just watched this on the kardashians it seems like kim had a saying and she s like should i have kanye be my musical guest it s like shouldn t we definitely not put these two guys together at this time and if jason s having to serve olivia with paperwork it means that he doesn t have access to her correct no legally when you when someone s being served i like if i sued you i could not personally hand you the papers but why has to be a third party but if he s at the point of suing her then sorry for her child he was he it s uh custody business i believe i know but that means that they were not able to come to a conclusion right on their own so he s having to sue her so the fact that he is going to be on snl with harry styles to me i mean this serving situation seems like it s not all amicable oh obviously the fact that they re coinciding in this i mean is a ratings gold but what if they get in a huge fight live i mean is olivia not going to be there to support her new man while he has to encounter if i were her i would steer very clear of that event i would not attend and if i were one of those dudes i would be like oh excuse me guys i believe there s been an oversight and you happen to have paired me with uh the man who s A A my former wife like i would not want that stark seems tragic all around yeah it s uncomfortable we got ta cut and we ll be right back scene one take two marker well in a shocking turn of events a couple of silly geese fell for a fake headline it was on my explore page and it was like this is indeed real and nice and there were like multiple slides and like showing proof that it was posted so how did it how did the fakeness come about well first we have to say jason sedakis and harry styles not going to be on snl together that was just a joke people posted a joke headline and we read it and we re like wow this is wild and that s why it s a joke because it s so blatantly obviously funny because it could never happen because that would be although can you imagine the highest ratings in the show s history for sure maybe they should do it so we don t look like A A morons yeah and honestly this is i m going to call laura michaels and be like hey lauren like my friend rylan and i this is why tiktok and instagram are so toxic because you can just put out whatever the A A you want and stupid people like me believe it and i m like did you hear with such conviction and then i m speculating on how awkward this is and why olivia was surfing the paper like this can t be real like we got daddy goes that can t be real let me actually look into it it s not i don t deserve this i literally feel like i m going oh my god don t do it hold it together i feel so nauseous like i feel like don t talk about it unless you re gon na be about it jump outside i i might need that trash can honestly i wonder what s going on with me are you sick sick i don t know like i feel so ill what did you what were the leftovers i can t even focus are you gon na throw up should i leave it s pat like it it s passing it s passing no but i still need that in case it comes back you need to give me enough warning to get out of here because if you start doing that i m gon na have to i just i m so sorry for them more than you i feel like it s about to come out both ends quite frankly do you have the norovirus is that what this is if you start A A and vomiting yeah probably i feel like that s what s going on and now i ve given it to you i m not good with norovirus i thought for a second the i wasn t feeling well the other night and so i took a covered test last night and i didn t i don t have covid so maybe i have something else and i shouldn t be by you guys if it s a norovirus i will literally A A kill maybe you should run now if i honest to god my dog is so sick if i am if i wind up laid up on the toilet A A and vomiting my brains out right now i will set your entire A A house on fire i told you i was not well before you came yeah but you re never well you always say i m unwell how am i supposed to take you so you re the boy who cried on well i m yeah but i m like lightheaded feeling like i m going to barf with something about to fall out of my ass oh fall out like it s not even gon na need like a push like it s just gon na drop i can t laugh right now don t laugh right now i m so sad on our met gala review do you want to just speed through it as fast as we can and then call it a short one well no what i love i love doing the met gal once let s try and then if you start shifting and vomiting i ll just A A dip okay let s quickly get to the the kardashians what the A A was kim wearing before she was going to snl she was in a full neon pink ski outfit as though she was hitting the slopes in aspen colorado yeah but she was standing in her hotel room and she changed before she got paparazzi to go to snl yeah so she was wearing that to film the kardashians and i just couldn t fathom what she was doing i couldn t tell you i mean she s the fashion icon so yeah i ll leave it up to her honestly we all thought they were batshit crazy when they were wearing sweats and bralettes and now like look at us out in these streets and sweats and bralettes so catch me next season in a A A aspen jacket ready to hit the slopes even though i haven t done that since the s do you know what i m talking about of course you re talking about and it was right when kanye was delivering the he got the rest of the video and i watched it and it s like not sex and it s like so what did he get you and why does it matter as if it also doesn t exist on a cloud somewhere though like nobody has footage only existing on one device like it was a computer and a hard drive kanye s like i got rid of the club and chris is like can we bring the cameras and she s like yeah bring the cameras as if this wasn t planned i i feel bad for the woman like i know she doesn t want to relive this with her children and do it all over again and i m glad that she went through the trouble of like securing the bag but like sounds like the bag might have might have not been a thing which also might be why ray j s like it s not a thing yeah he started commenting on all of yeah he s like it s not a sexy well in the show she s like oh it s no more sex and kanye s saying he flew commercial for this i love that they keep saying that like he s like a A A hero i flew with regular people but like he s like sick by it and he s like i had to sit by poor people i flew couch but like what was that he s like private plane catch kanye on spirit airlines like whoa no but why couldn t he charter his jet and why couldn t he charter oh my god why couldn t he charter kim s chat like this i don t know i just don t understand i and you know what i don t care and then i was thinking more about the amy schumer collaboration i think it s a plug for life after beth which is just like the slowest A A show well i started thinking yeah because you were so confused by the merging of the two and then i vocalized it out loud while shane was in the room and he goes they re cross promoting for her life of beth show oh and i thought oh my gosh oh wow everything makes sense now because she showed up she s product please imagine she is product placement it s A A i don t know i don t doubt they have text conversations but there s no world in which kim s like thanks for the advice i m taking none of it thanks amy you re truly one of my best friends if it wasn t planted by hulu so i just thought it was a weird interesting plant yeah um do you feel manipulated because honestly i watched life of beth and i couldn t tell you much about it but i do have to say that amy i am starting to realize amy schumer s brand of humor yeah i mean she definitely is funny like i i mean i m realizing what it is what do you mean i m i m understanding her tone and her voice i m not laughing but i i do see her and i hear her i do hear her i hear her voice what she brings is funny to me like i watched her last appearance on the ellen degeneres show and i thought it like she brings it like yeah and i appreciate her bringing strategic bits to thing events such as talk shows because so many people are snorefest on talk shows so i do appreciate what she s giving to the world what did she do on ellen she was just funny she was funnier than the average person i mean she was being amy schumer but like it made me laugh on more than one occasion okay okay um this one was brought to my oh okay there is a verdict in the kardashian verse blac chyna trial which is the kardashians win and owe no money to china the result happened on met gala monday just a few hours ago while china was sitting in the courtroom alone because the kardashians were attending the met gala they re like the verdict isn t even important too because like black giant are you a crazy A A and these women are all at the met gala looking A A a little ridiculous everyone except for kim is looking a little ridiculous and i read that this is something like the trial is five years after the initial lawsuit so i think that s fairly normal i know but it s like to stay passionate and to hope that you could win for five years to take it to trial when the evidence all lined up against her like it all boils down to for me she wouldn t have gotten the reality show if it weren t for the kardashians to begin with so even if they had a big play in canceling the second season of her show she really has no runway to say like this was something i created on my own well that wasn t what she was even trying to say well she was saying the money she lost out on because the show was canceled but i m saying and she s saying the show was canceled because of false claims from the kardashians because that s what defamation is but she also had a restraining order on rob after the first season so it s very likely that the producers would never pick it up to begin with but the the point of the defamation lawsuit like we talked about last week is can if it s true the person is not guilty of defamation so the truth that they proved in court legally on record is that blac chyna is a nasty A A and what i m saying is for her to believe with conviction for five years knowing the facts that she was that she thought she was going to win is what s crazy to me yeah and the kardashians aren t just all gon na show up to court for not like if they didn t think they were gon na win they would have settled and paid her out yeah so it s just ironic i think it s so funny i met gala monday when kim s wearing marilyn monroe s dress because you re legally declared a crazy A A it s just so unfortunate like i feel like a loser on met gal monday so my heart goes out to blac chyna i mean i don t know if that s where you want to start i don t know if that s the wraparound for you but you know what let s he s not saying i guess he s not feeling i literally could pass out at any minute he s barely holding it together do not hold the blac chyna statement against him do you want to get into netflix my hands are temporary so what should we do or do we want to talk about how that that stank ass megan merkel s cartoon was dropped by netflix and so she might have to sell another expose to make her million dollar development deal netflix s q numbers have come out and they re in the negative for the first time ever and they re saying it s not only because they pulled out of russia because everything that s going on but also just because everyone s swapping between streaming services and i think netflix had to cut ties with some of the most expensive projects one being meghan markle s show which i think they signed like a hundred and fifty million dollar deal like a development deal yeah yes so i think them backing out of this show probably saved them probably tens of millions of dollars it was a cartoon it was a child s cartoon show yeah it s like megan nobody wanted this from you but nobody s ever wanted any of the shits you make and your book is stupid and for your children s book is stupid oh my gosh it is anyone who s ready so everyone was team meghan markle and pretending that she wasn t like some kind of sort of villain again like everyone has facets to them and i m sure her narrative has been spun out of control by the media such as every other celebrity so like we never know where she truly lies like evil great probably somewhere in the middle like the rest of it i mean no matter what when that couple was coming out with all of these different jobs that was paying them ten to tens of two hundreds of millions of dollars i just like honestly it left a really bad taste in my mouth because why in the A A would you ever give that much money and development for what product do you know what i mean like what are they developing well they re like what the A A is it because it feels like you re just giving these people money because they re formerly royal of course yeah but they re not doing anything in regards to being formerly right they let the heat die had this show come out a month after everything that was going on when they were at the top of all the headlines the investment you really think a six month old is gon na turn off coco melon to watch megan merkel s pearl well i think it s they re probably looking at like barack obama s series came out which i m sure is wonderful and it was trash i tried to watch it people people didn t watch it so they re probably just realizing like oh our money is better spent in other places like the big names don t necessarily draw in well those are those kinds of big names like who gives a A A about and also like by the way love barack obama i really do i tried to read his autobiography the audacity of hope but it was in his voice in my head so it went really slow and i just couldn t keep going my dad loved that book i m sure and it s a great no i know and i m so pissed because the only reason why i put it down was because i was reading it in barack s voice in his cadence which is very A A slow could not make it through the first chapter that being said i A A love him he s a charismatic bright light in every room put on his nature show because i love a nature show and to be like some shots were so similar that even though he s in a new location it feels like a jump cut like not even your dogs were interested my dogs could give a A A and they love that A A it was wild so it s also like it s barack obama like where did that money go did his daughter shoot this and also she went to documentarian school so she should be better at this oh that s oh it s dark okay um james corden s late night show is being canceled after this upcoming season he s doing one more round and he s announced that he s done so you put this on the document did i add let s make this i added let s make this about us because i don t know why there s not one goddamn person in hollywood that s not watching our podcast thinking that we need a morning show or a late night show no i m not suited for late night i m not oh well no that we recorded during the day even so like i m not of the landscape of late night it s more like one two punch like punchline funny yeah i think we re more suited in like we would have ryan and kelly i don t know if i can deliver that i m telling you i m more like in the scope of ryan and kelly um you don t think we could do like a chelsea handler panel show um i could never i think you re funny you made me laugh recently i don t remember what you said but i do remember no and even i got my friend mal called me after coloring mine and she said rylan s funny thank you mal she said i didn t know he was funny i thought he was just weird and awkward but he s very funny i said no his funny is his weird and awkward well i don t think i m weird or awkward well then you don t know yourself thanks a lot mal learning lots today uh no but i just think like no give us a A A studio audience give us the wendy williams A A show well no i love wendy williams i do not want to replace wendy s no but like give us uh i ll take the time slot leading into or coming after wendy williams yeah but and we can t be live and we re cheap like not we re cheap but the show s not expensive i m affordable i am an affordable talent we re the budget of the show like they have a one time set that they have to build and then it s really like and i do have to say i get a lot of questions from people how big is your production and i say my production is very small what do you mean my production at the sip what i have produced here for you guys is the three of us in ryland s shed it s just me chris and ryland and then i edit every episode and color correct it and i upload it to all the platforms such a hero so what was i doing and adding it like no that is the james cord intro no that i mean it s the end of an era and it s crazy and he s like i see more for myself but typically speaking the people who do these like late late shows and the tonight show and that they do it till death do they part or maybe he s going to go take over for what someone else is well shane was like do you think he s going to take over for ellen and i said well no he has another year he has another year on his contract and then i started thinking well isn t that a downgrade technically from late night to a daytime slot but actually the late night hosts aren t what they once were somebody s calling you um like in terms of ratings and views actually the most popular talk show right now is live with kelly and ryan and they re getting like over million views yeah live but i know james is also like a very talented actor and singer yeah i think he s talented at everything i mean he showcases that on a lot like me yeah so maybe you have a time slot in late night but i don t i think it s been long enough we need to get into the met gala fashion let s get into the mecca faction review i m gon na have to put some cards because i know people are just gon na want to jump right here because i was so in in comprehensive today i just think that you don t realize that every time we re at our worst our show is at its best i don t think so today like my hands are tingling i m gon na pass out every monday no i don t he s always like i can t feel my face like okay let s get into our met gala fashion review it wouldn t be the met gala if we didn t start with the queen herself anna wintour now vogue puts on the event so she is the reigning queen of vogue um it s serving peacock it s serving nena it s serving bird it s serving uh would you like some biscuits and gravy yeah is this vegan is pita going to be okay with this it looks like feathers yeah there s looks like there s feathers on there you know we should have done our due diligence and been like she s wearing blah blah blah so and so and styled by such and such oh no it doesn t say that okay well that s anna wintour glad we covered her i think it s the moment you ve all been waiting for where you get no information about people we don t even know who they are it s age appropriate i like the hairstyle the crown is a lot but i guess she s owning it i think the crown is on theme because the theme this year is yeah serve it too it s a continuation of last year s theme which is probably because it s like could they not think of a new thing ask to ask is that the rest of this episode lexicon of fashion the gilded age oh what even is the met gala gilded glamour met gala will celebrate the second volume in a two part costume institute exhibition exhibition we re fine the first in america lexicon of fashion so the first in america is that why kim is wearing marilyn monroe because she s one of the first icons i think that was the first volume so this is volume two which is gilded glamour i ll never understand what the mech gala is i think guilty glamour is more of like an s sort of vibe which is why you re going to see a lot of people who are dressed a little bit like downton not downton abbey but like what s that other english uh bridgerton um there s mad bridgerton vibes i m just saying you ll see as we progress through the looks i don t think there s a world in which i ll ever retain what the met gala itself is it s a fundraising event for the metropolitan museum of modern art okay there s more to it which i know because last year when we did this someone in the comments was like this is what the A A it is and you guys are stupid and it s like obviously we re stupid we fall for fake news you didn t come here to learn what the A A the met gal is about you came here to listen to two very stupid beautiful people talk about other very stupid beautiful people wow if it isn t a time to be emma chamberlain but do you see the vibe with emma chamberlain here where it s a little bit modern bridge um oh bridge abbreviation yeah and that apparently is the gilded whatever gosh you know chris maybe you should look up what that means guilded guilded something gilded glamour we re good for nothing good for nothing but hot as hell honestly it s never been a better time to be emma chamberlain she s getting better and better so much better so much and it s just as like is she an actual guest this year is she was she a guest last year she well she s a guest but she s also doing she s conducting interviews for the youtube channel which feels very fitting yeah and she s been doing making all of the fashion rounds like she gets invited to everything now because isn t she a model for louis vuitton she s always in collaboration with louis vuitton and one of the other big companies did i just say louis yeah does anyone say louis vuitton i don t know we re gon na go to the next person whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i wasn t done gawking over emma chambers hold on turn my turn mark what is your name chris turn chris on let crispy um yes mark yes um so gilded means to show how wealth and glamour was used to conceal the social unrest and turmoil of the era and what was the era just reading what it says and it stops there i can look further into it what do you mean oh whatever who cares that s what popped up and i just read it i think wow i honestly love emma chamberlain s look i love the short hair she did the same color that kim kardashian did with the hair the platinum blonde and the jewel oh gosh i guess i want to be on a chamberlain yeah interesting and you love her coffee so i m boring is in this all black ensemble serving i am my father s daughter the youth no she s made a name for herself now no she looks like her A A dad oh okay that you mean in terms of that yeah i think the euphoria cast is having a moment right now they re getting invited to just everything i mean i think good for her that s all you have to say about her and you just sucked A A emma chamberlain s rug dry well because i thought emma chamberlain looked good she like took a risk on the record rylan adams thinks mod apatow is trash that s not true i love all epitals including wesley mann um i think this is the boy from no is it not this is no he s not a euphoria boy evan mock evan mock is another hbo max girly he is in the reboot of gossip girl which i found unwatchable okay though he is a cutie patootie i believe he is also

just like is there gon na be jared leto s serving my sleep paralysis demon i can t i hate it so much i know that he s done like this is probably a master craft of fashion but it s something i hate no

because of it he just exudes like i have a big penis and i don t want to talk to anybody do you think he has a big penis i don t know because there s a prosthetic in the show but that s the energy he

i should be like oh my god well they are brothers i don t know i don t like it i m not sure how they could complete the circle for you though i m unclear on the assignment and i don t know what s

if it s like a designer i love that i wish i could work with i m sure i wish i could be them honestly i do think that they are stunning people yeah and i do have to say i get the jonas brothers more and more their circle becomes complete for me whenever i see them on tick tock they re funny guys and maybe that s what s missing funny little guys i don t consume their tick tocks yeah that s when i fell in love with harry styles too i just feel like this sophie turner character isn t real like i feel like her real name i don t know it says sophie turner okay i always thought that might be her

Music so Music one take one oh my gosh oh sorry do you want this tied um i don t know lizzy okay do you know that it s tied uh yeah i can see that here now maybe it s the style you never know it could be you re a trendsetter okay well i m leaving it oh my gosh hello hello what s up everybody i m lizzie gordon this is ryland adams and you re watching the sioux i kind of hate it i kind of hate it too i think we should go back next week okay okay you have a little bit of lipstick on your teeth why do you always wait till we re rolling to do this to me and then you shame me for cleaning it off you re acting like i m not the cameraman i m not the audio man i m not trying to get myself ready and produce this show i m sure you guys have noticed we re chrysalis we are chrysalis and that s just part of our bad morning no today i m in a fantastic mood i am too i m doing really good um even though in spite despite inspiring honestly not clear on that one either potty and sound off in the comments below did i get it um did i get it oh i think so now i m starting to think we re blown out whatever here we are i m turning the light down just a little and now we re hideous now they re like wow you guys are real ugly um okay do you want to talk about your morning or should i talk about my morning well i just wanted to say uh i feel like this is a great segue because you like asked how to say something the right way because you didn t feel intuitively right which you might be right i don t know i don t have the answer to that but i did want to say i watched a little bit of your latest vlog okay at the like minute mark you said all of a sudden and that s the right way yeah see i was actually thinking i had to play it back a bunch of times to make sure you said uh instead of the but i m pretty sure you said ah well and i actually you had me perplexed this weekend as i was walking my dogs my i think a cell phone tower went down over here so i no longer have service at my house which is a tragedy so i m tr i normally listen to a podcast on my walk but so i m just all i have is me and my thoughts when i m on my walk this weekend nightmare yeah honestly and for some reason i that all of a sudden really started replaying in my mind and then i couldn t remember which was the correct one and i was trying to convince myself of which makes grammatically the most sense because all of a sudden you re saying is the right word all of the sudden why is the not right do you want to google it we ve googled it before we have on the show on the show that s why it s so exhausting i just don t think that that sounds crazy the so the i went to the mall all of the sudden it sounds like yeah but like sudden i don t think sudden and maul are the same kind of words and i m too stupid to play it out right now on this on air because i wasn t i was raised by wolves so no one like taught me like nouns like verbs like i i don t know so you re fine being passionately angry and no it s it s just that i know you re wrong do you know what i mean and that s fine but i wanted to know the origin of why it s wrong and then maybe i would actually fix that because when i in eighth grade was using the wrong form the noun usage of sudden has all but been abandoned by history and the word has become bound to all in the idiom of all of a sudden meaning suddenly or sooner than expected there is no grammatical reason why the correct phrase is all of a sudden versus all of this sudden it s just the recognized form of the idiom so it s irrational that s okay that s okay and that s okay i think that s okay i think we need to lay it to rest ryland is now allowed and granted by the city of calabasas to say all of the sudden and we re gon na let it go because it s an irrational idiom and he says you know A A society yeah which so punk rock of you thank you it s hot like travis barker you know what i mean like you re like part of that trend of bad boys i m wearing my hoodie with a weird tie in the middle i m saying wow this morning i m getting ready for the show for some reason i like all night i could not sleep i was tossing and turning i was having one of those nights i think i need to change the width of my pillow for some reason i get you because it s just not working out no i totally understand what you re saying and so for the last three nights it s like i can t get comfortable and then i finally go to sleep an hour before my alarm like deep sleep rem sleeping living i m loving i m having a great time although in my dream i m not able to get coffee like i rented out my own office space and put a keurig in there to get coffee and i could not get coffee that i went to a coffee store and it was like i couldn t get coffee anyways i wake up it s not too relevant but i wake up this morning and i like can t open my eyes so i m a zombie walking down through the halls is this still the dream no this is my real life now i m walking down through the halls because i couldn t wake up because i was in such a rem sleep but i had to wake up for the podcast okay so i m walking down down the hall i let the dogs out i m doing my morning routine and then i start coffee to go out and like bring the dogs back in and i come back and the coffee is just all over everywhere oh yeah i ve never i ve forgotten my cups before but i normally get it like in the nick of you just didn t put a cup at all literally heard the machine running i was like great my coffee is going to be ready when i come back you just made a counter coffee came back to a disaster just a big old mess of coffee because you didn t put the cup in it s okay i threw up this morning i was like violently wretching and like vomiting it was awful it s because i took my vitamins on an empty stomach which i like never do but i i thought i had time you know what i mean like i was like i m gon na take this handful i m gon na drink a little bit of green tea but it s like those are two things that always make me vomit if i have green tea on an empty stomach i vomit yeah me too well i don t know if i vomit but i ve become so ill i can t move i vomit you should never but i m so sick that i was like this

was the closest to where i was and i was like can you not hear me vomiting where are you then she texts me it s just a photo of him engulfed in a shirt yeah he s wearing a shirt on his face right now sometimes it s panties though he hates when i talk about him on air and i was like just get the man a silk sleeping mask the man s had silk sleeping masks he they vanish i find them weeks later they look like dead dried rats underneath the bed like i m not about that life if he wants to wrap a shirt over his face he can wrap a shirt over his face okay we ll let the man sleep how he wants i was i don t even like taking vitamins after i m full because sometimes i still get nauseous just because they re so powerful i mean i never have a problem after i m but i literally was like well what s the bold move in this morning saying oh i can manage taking these because i was sitting down i was already sitting down with my muffin oh i got la panquatition for three meals yesterday so i was eating my little pancakian bran muffin i had had like a bite of it and so i took the handful of pills after the bite of it and instantaneously my stomach was like A A you A A and i was like and i was like oh my god this is so dramatic i love it jelly s having diarrhea in the backyard i m like running from wretching to the back door to wipe the poop off her butt like back to the toilet like mom life that s what it s like having two under two i m running the putt the extension i m running extension cords out to the shed so that we can the power s still out yeah i didn t have time last week i also just don t have an electrician i have like a really good contractor but he s out of town right now so i don t know what i m about to do with this oh extension cords extend it up do you want to talk about your trip to arizona it was so good i had a beautiful time with my goddaughter and my best friend haley all of your friends have children and yeah i also don t know when s enough photos for me like you oh there s never enough you could never have enough photos of my goddaughter you could never have enough photos of my goddaughter you know it you know it but it s like minute now there s never enough there s never enough i wish you could just do a shared album so i could look at when i want to look instead of like no you need to play by playing the day all day it s either a playback we re going to costco oh it s your first trip to costco you cold hearted A A no no she s so cute and they and they were good pictures they were in new jersey she had sonny s on very she was dressed very cute she s adorable she s such a chill baby that she let me put multiple outfits on her before we landed on one and do you think she likes you oh she loves me so i didn t spend the night at their house because joe and i were tag teaming the trip it was his mom and haley so uh we stayed at his mom s house so i would just be with haley and the baby all day and then i would go back to his mom s house um but when i came back after sleeping in his mom s house they were watching the sip and lily you walked in the front door and they re watching the show thank you so much yeah thank god for you guys never enough pictures of that baby never enough i told you i walk in and lily s face A A lights up and she s like liz she said my name she speaks no she doesn t speak she didn t say my name but it felt like she wanted to i swear to god she lit up if we have to call haley and have her say it so the people aren t like liz is lying that baby recognizes me and she A A with me heavy do they think you re a liar everybody in the comment section thinks i m a liar wow it s shocking i have to dip out when i know i ve behaved badly what like in the comment section yeah like if i know i was in a bad mood or something i just can t participate in the comments because i can t then i m like if i was in a bad mood on the podcast i m already in a fragile state of mind so i m not of state to be looking at people critiquing me so i know like when s appropriate to dip in and out the comments like randomly these people will be like she s a A A liar she did not meet big ryan it s like okay was that your theranose voice oh it could be yeah did i have way down oh you re with theronos we have herpes have you finished the series yeah i finished last night i honestly checked out a bit i loved it i checked out a bit i couldn t get into it the first episode but then i kept hearing everyone raving about it and i just couldn t have thought it was more phenomenal like episodes six and seven specifically yeah those are hot they re just like the last episode was fine i would say the ones leading up to the finale she s just a psycho A A who wanted everything and let her have it i mean no she can t have it she s literally i bet she s going to jail for years even if she only serves half of that and the craziest thing is like days before her company shut down she s just at coachella or at burning man and then she gets pregnant and no A A is wild A A is wild that s like a different kind of departed from reality and it s nuts to bets to me and you never know what exactly is real versus false i m sure people yeah but in the show they allude to her being a psychopath so many times just being like you know i i love you right even though i feel things differently yeah i thought that they did a really good job of like making dramatic inferences in specific scenes and sequences that tell a story and i liked that they show her as a young girl departing for college saying i want to drop out and i want to be this and i want to be that i want to be a billionaire i want to run a billionaire tech company you can see how she got where she got it just so crazy that when the tech isn t working she s still full steam ahead it s like let s find funding to fund the development of the product but she just got caught up in the um the lamborghinis the houses the A A but did she enjoy it i don t think murdock is his name i don t think so or is it robert rupert okay yeah pray for us fascinating fascinating stuff yeah no i A A with it are you watching the girl from plainville that i m gon na try to get into that that show makes me A A sick sick well do you want to bring them up if they haven t heard about it so it s it s another true story about another bad girl who uh did a small amount of time in jail or prison i think oh wait ruin it for all of us it s a true story i know but remember like you were saying what you liked about inventing anna as you didn t know that yeah and i ve specifically been avoiding the ends there was no like big documentary about inventing anna there was a big documentary about the girl from plainville girl carolina caroline i know but i didn t watch it oh i i thought that was a big viral thing it might be shane was telling me about it and i was like what yeah so there may they and honestly like as a person who like i really like true crime i consume true crime i some i wrote a true crime thing like i this show is making me have like a moral complex about it well you so she it s a girl who was dating a boy loosely dating they they were young they met on a family vacation in florida they started having text relationship which honestly like some texture relationships do feel real and i would say that they are real you re burying your soul to this person you talk to them there is no separation between your communication because it s all day and it s incessant yeah but where it s crazy is she no but what i m saying like i m just saying like some text relationships can seem real i had a text relationship when i graduated from college it s just like and i d never hung out with the person in real life like but we went to the same college i don t think that invalidates a real friendship at all being a test uh and both of these people had mental illness and he had attempted suicide previously and i am not clear on what her illness is or what her medication or what her treatment was for but she had like an obsessive personality and she was obsessed with leah michelle and she was obsessed with michelle ugly convinced or she she taught him forward to yeah committing suicide himself he was considering but she really like helped him get all the way there and see the see it through trigger warning there he s in the he s in a car and he s using the car as a means to end his life and he got scared and he said i m scared i m getting out of the car she said get back in the car oh i haven t got to that part yet either that s what made the whole story like that was the big headline and so everybody s saying is that tantamount to manslaughter or homicide uh which are two different things i think hers was in manslaughter i don t remember honestly watch the show but like this is so dark that i kind of want to do a little bit of research and find out if his family is involved with it also i know she s out of she s done serving her time and she s back home now wow and she has a pixie haircut it s in the daily mail the other day but uh it s on like the show is very disturbing it s just so melancholy and ominous and disturbing to watch this young man s life unravel crumble yeah and her she s i don t think she s a villain necessarily because she is clearly sick right and i guess that s the whole that s the whole thing it s like is this person guilt like yeah yeah so it s but so i m yeah i m having a hard time watching it and i kind of like can t look away because it s so haunting and sad i don t know i ll have to watch before i can commentate more yeah the jury s still out for me i m probably gon na keep watching but i do want to do a tiny bit more research into whether or not his family is on board with it because it s so deeply personal right and it s so sad oh on board with the show it s yes right because it s so intimate and it s so A A and it s like ah yeah i don t know it s sad also you know if you re not if you re not feeling well out there seek help it s better to seek help because no matter what you have to remember that there are days that you re like wow i m psyched i m here oh yeah and i m i m laughing and it does get better from here you know yeah it s very yeah we re yeah where are we going from here well that s the thing how do you transition out of that do we just do we go like balls deep into hot cheetos fruit roll ups and pickles yeah our tick tock taste test we have a tick tock taste test lizzy on friday night sent me a photo of what she was doing and it was just a bunch of random snacks and i was like she s having a rager i had no idea that this was like a viral food combination and then yeah some i mean i d seen the hot girls on tiktop tick tock jesus the hot girls you know the hot girls okay like tana mongoose she s doing this yeah i saw her wrap a pickle in a fruit roll up okay and then eat it with a taki so you chase it with a taki yeah take a bite oh it s dripping get yourself a napkin i m not gon na get a A A napkin i m fine ugh you re not oh my god the pickle i told you to get a napkin oh my god take a bite you ate that century egg take a bite i m going to take it back don t be doing that on your white carpet you maniac it s already dirty i m just like it s not the sight of pickles in general are just so nasty i ve never been like a a pickle cruncher boy if you puke right now i m gon na punch you in the stomach okay give me a tacky to chase i personally think the talkies are trash why are you doing it so close to the microphone like juicing everywhere i gave you the napkin i m gon na turn the microphone away from you you know the fruit roll up makes the pickle more bearable gross right oh my god it s giving fruit uh oh my god it s giving trix cereal yeah i hated it with the taki so try it with the flaming hot lime oh my god it really gives tricks it s a fruit roll up of course it gives tricks but with the pickle and the taki as well i honestly think the flaming hot with lamone is better or lime better right i oddly think it s fantastic oh i feel like we need to use a different pickle you know the bucket pickles from costco no i think those would be better because i ve been eating bucket pickles with strawberry jelly beans and they re everything i love this you do well keep going i can t do it because after i had two and two like full ones yeah so you did like it you wouldn t eat two more ones if you didn t like it you don t really know me then you re right you re going to just going after whatever i um i ate too and then literally A A fired it felt like i had a A A bladder infection in my A A it hurt so bad i think it s delicious it s fun who thought of that i don t know no i don t think it was tick tock i think somebody had it s a like a deep like some people even go like crazy or they ll like drench it in chamois and sprinkle some tahini on it and then like freeze it some will even like hollow out the pickle and put the crunchy A A on the inside but i didn t think we want to do that because it s gon na get soggy anyways anyways it was delicious and if you eat two they re gon na hurt coming up so don t eat two um did you have a son s game update you put it on the document oh yeah we went to the suns game the suns now are officially they broke a record at the game i was at they this was their rd win of the season which is uh broke their record of wins per season and was pretty A A sick i had a great time with my hubby and his mummy on our anniversary it was our month

given will be the sperm because it the velocity in which i mean they still have to test the velocity i don t know the do you mean the word velocity i don t know velocity it s like the speed and direction of which an object is moving okay no okay that s what i thought i was like what the A A do you mean velocity of your A A i think i d have to be into a vitality is vitality the word maybe god the numbers are high enough all we do here is words we need to start whatever i guess you can watch the vlog for the sperm update do you have the egg yet has it been cultivated um no they re doing has been snatched they re no because they have to start the ivf process for her as well but they re doing she s she you have to do a medical clearance she s a previous donor so it should be a lot easier

some of mine they d make some breezes right yep yeah and then we ll freeze ours until our surrogate is ready which we don t have just yet and we re we re seeking but desperately seeking a womb yeah exciting stuff yeah so maybe we can be mommies together i mean your trajectory is a little bit ahead of mine yeah we ll see but you might get pushed back some yeah you never know there s a lot of different factors with what we re doing so yeah we could be right on schedule with each other yeah possibly i m excited it would be so fun we could do mommy and me yogas yeah we could do no we really should do mommy and me yoga and we could also like put our babies in our strollers and go on power walks yeah oh my gosh we could be morning sick together you could take vitamins on an empty tummy and we could yak together stupid okay um i did want to request you know i never plug the audio of our podcast yeah but people listen to the audio of our podcast dad s listening right now and when i was when i was out of podcasts to listen to this week i went to the top charts and i was like hmm i wonder like why the sips we graced when we debuted we premiered but i think because we re a video podcast we never really make the charts so i was just wondering like what determines being in the charts of the podcast like because i don t think it s listens i think it s like the youtube trending page where it s an algorithm mixed with um a variety based upon a lot of different things so i was just wondering if you guys are listening to the audio if you could just rate review and rate and review our podcast i m curious to see like if an influx in reviews will put us on the map you know we love being mac based i don t know i just i think it could be fun to hit the trending page oh i love hitting the treading page have i ever i mean when we debuted the podcast yeah i mean it s it s top charts on pogba so where the A A is our subscriber plaque oh i ll have to ask my lady lady i ll have to ask me a lady um also since we re on the topic of reproduction i want to know how chickens reproduce because it just does not add up to your audience knows best yeah the potty and snow s best you guys helped with my ingrown toenail thank you yeah they did i have to go to the doctor it s basically the review what are they gon na do reshape how your toenail grows i m not gon na ask what they re gon na do i m just gon na let them do it first and foremost because i could i like what i garnered from the comment section is that this is a saw like scenario where they re gon na take off the tip of my toe put it in their mouth chew on it spit it back out and stitch it back on and i don t need to know you know what i mean like i don t need to know they can just do what they do they can fix it my dad called and he s like here s what you do you pull the nail back as far as you can then you stick some rolled up cotton swab underneath the nail and have it grow out over it i m like is this a real conversation yeah i was like dude this sounds awful this sounds awful i m not looking for like long term offal i m looking for like a quick fix awful like the doctor can abuse me and i can go home and it can heal but i m not about that A A cotton swab under the toenail life that s wild and are other people in the comment section doing that i think a lot of people in the comment section were doing that i i literally was so disturbed by the details of what some people have been doing for it and i didn t understand a lot of it so like one person was like cut a v into your toenail so that it grows in oh but i m like that sounds off like my ears are ringing thinking about it i didn t know it was such a problem but i guess yeah yeah so i m gon na go to the A A podiatrist i m not trying to A A around with this A A by myself anymore cause it s uh disturbing and then i also wan na know you guys like how do chickens A A i thought they only had i thought all chickens just had like a vent like one hole that like drops poop and eggs well i don t know maybe they don t pee no i don t i don t know if they A A i think the chicken i think they do A A because then the rooster sits on the egg that s insane that is well i know that you need might be the silliest thing you ve ever said you need a rooster doesn t just sit on the egg and fertilize it rylan where does do you think the rooster just like injects well she can do an egg no because not all people that have chickens have roosters because the roosters are loud and sometimes aggressive yeah and it takes a male and a female part but i m saying how do they A A do roosters have dicks so they don t need to A A to create the eggs is what you re saying no i m saying they do need to A A to create and why do you watch a rooster sitting on an egg does not make any sense well then why do chickens drop eggs without roosters do you know that our children are so A A don t i know i m gon na we ll get proper education i don t need you against me too my kids are just as A A up listen how do chickens that don t have roosters produce so many eggs no chickens produce eggs no matter what roosters fertilize them but i m saying how do they A A do roosters have dicks so you re saying they don t have to A A to have the eggs no i m saying they do have to A A no don t because the egg pops out without roosters no but to fertilize the egg they have to A A before the egg comes out i m assuming so whoa um see what i mean well yeah make it make sense i well i m sure they re gon na make it make sense and we re really stupid do roosters have dicks commercial break this is the best body and snow s best we ve ever done no the chicken lays the egg and then the rooster sits on it and then months later a baby comes out of their beaks okay

joinhoney com while you are reading the ads because we all know how i have a hard time focusing i looked up chicken s A A and like honestly i don t have any answers after looking at this diagram like where s the hole and like how is he in it we ll put that if you re watching the video you ll see the image if you re if you re audio only as we ve requested it looks as if there s just two holes on these chickens at random parts of their bodies that just mash up together and then semen comes from testicles inside of the male chicken into the lady chicken but do you see what i mean like where what so what i m confused about is why do chickens put out their unfertilized eggs as well it s like how women have a period oh oh my god wow you re right i am the no that s fine i m that s less concerning than you thinking that roosters just sit on eggs but do you see how what does this mean wow i am i m having a moment i like now i don t even know if i can air that segment because it was so bad no you have to it s the funniest thing you ve ever said so sincerely talking about roosters sitting on eggs it was literally the funniest A A you ve ever seen that would be me just sitting on also considering you ve been in fertility clinics for like a minute now talking about the reproductive process you re right it s shocking but also this is why we love you remember like we saw we always talk about like you re situationally funny it s the nuance of your unawareness like we love you this is who you are this is really bad for me no let it go it s so funny whatever we ll put up the diagram here take a look take a look it s senseless moving on to iced tea oh it s hot in here yeah you need some i see cool down that embarrassment face it s okay i m embarrassed too i don t get it i was looking at the picture too oh my god um so what do we want to talk about well you put on the document pete davidson s snl sketch prompts netflix to add a new movie category short movies short ass movies yeah which like thank A A god cause all for a long time i ve been like this A A is two hours and eight minutes the audacity okay so his sketch is all about how he wants a category with movies what under one hour and minutes yeah like under two hours basically and so he wants us it s like one of their like snl i guess does like raps now i didn t even know pete davidson was still on snl i thought he was so busy with kim i don t i mean you you re watching you know no i don t watch but every clip i have seen in the past month or so he hasn t been around so i just know he always kind of has like a like a he like he was on snl when kim was on us now they kissed there well no i know i thought it s been since he s dating him that he s been on less and less i m not an avid viewer so yeah i haven t been an avid viewer of snl for a hot minute but he is part of it and he does do like musical comedy sketches that are pre recorded they re not part of the live show oh wow so maybe he s not showing up to the lives no he s showing up to the lives because sometimes he s like on a weekend update or like aladdin kissing kim okay whatever so in this sketch what i thought was wrong he s like i need a short ass movie a really short movie like whatever those are the words but i identify because it s like when do like where d it was like was licorice pizza A A five hours was moonfall A A five hours also i tried to watch moon fall twice and fell asleep both times and woke up and each time it was still A A going well i was trying to watch i i wanted to watch judd apatow s new movie but i saw it was a billion hours long and i was like i don t know when i m gon na have time to commit to the whole thing so i mean i understand what he s saying i laughed the most in the sketch when he was like i peed my pants twice watching batman because like when you do go to a theater it is like you got ta play i think movie theaters need to add pee breaks they used to so yeah so when i saw the lord of the rings in theaters when i was like they had an intermission like vhs tapes used to be two tapes so when you turn the other one over it s like all right A A go peepee right now like if it s over two hours it needs to have a p break at the hour moment it s absurd i want to see how long the moon falls two hours okay still too long god damn i thought you would love this though because you have your short little your little short attention span your cute little yeah you re petite detention very rarely am i here for a movie that s over two hours long no and also here s because like i ve been reading a lot of scripts i ll it s like give me a to page script all this A A is like pages like girl well and i think you think you re saying something not profound they come i mean if you re new and breaking into the industry you have to deliver a short script it s the people that have been making movies forever that can justify an audience showing up for them that stretched their movies longer and longer over time yeah like the irishman was like hours too long give me a mini series so speaking of the kardashians also loved the irishman though uh did it s coming out this week have you been the kardashians yeah i m so excited did they are did that tell all interview air yes where did it air oh my gosh on television with robin roberts on what channel A A on abc on hulu the next day you know what you are a fake fan no i did i couldn t find it anymore hulu what are you talking about literally everywhere you look at kardashians it s like hulu should we talk about it next week so i can watch it fine what happened in it i mean nothing really i i feel like they didn t get enough of what they needed so then they hired all these commentators to come in and they kind of just talked about the evolution of the kardashians with mixed in with like small moments of questions that robin asked the girls and what i thought was interesting is kylie didn t show up to that but then kyle shows up to the premiere and kendall doesn t show up to the premiere so i m like those two girls they just like pick and choose when they re gon na show up to these things but still catching i love those A A honest to god i A A live for the jenner girls i think what i did the takeaway i thought was interesting was k kim is very upfront and honest about like oh i wanted to be famous and i am made for fame she s like not not many people are made for fame like i thrive with fame like and it s true like you see fame crumbles a lot of people because it s public scrutiny it s people s opinions from all angles it s every move you make is scrutinized and i do think she does have this calm zen persona where she s able to take anything and make it into a positive for herself to keep moving forward yeah so i thought that was my interesting takeaway from it because you even see some of the other sisters just aren t as much like kendall kendall hates it kendall s sitting at her in her beautiful home having a panic attack which is very sad because she didn t really choose the life chose her like yeah those girls were born under the A A whereas kim was very intentionally that s what she wanted to do and even like like chloe i think the fame she like loves and hates the fame i think she goes in waves i find chloe to be devastating oh my gosh honestly i do like like she s so open about how traumatizing and awful it s been for her entire existence to be compared physically to courtney and kim and then you see her physical evolution and the way that she talks about people s body image is not the nicest so imagine how she talks to herself yeah i mean i can t imagine and that s what i think kim means it takes a special unique person to be able to take all of that and stay grounded yeah like us like we re totally fine not knowing how a chicken s anatomy works like you can say what you want in the comments we are self secured so the show s coming out tomorrow have you been watching any of the press leading up to like they ve been doing the late night rounds they had their malibu house no wow well you sent me the one tick tock what the one tick tock where kim just talks about how this season s different being that oh yes where that woman s like god you re so beautiful the girl the tick tock is like literally starstruck by kim grabbing kim s hand and kim is just sort of like frozen a little bit um that was my take away from that and then my takeaway was what kim was saying is different being that this seems more docu series s yeah where they follow the sisters independently as opposed to together with contrived storylines of like let s do a sister run off or they just put them in a room and it s like okay yeah beat the A A out of each other which well i think that was probably a natural moment yeah they re probably constantly beating the A A out of each other and not constantly but things evolve and come to the surface but i do like i m i m fascinated to see i think it s gon na be classy as A A i m so hyped for this show there s probably so much money in it i m excited i didn t watch the kardashians on e i haven t the kardashians on e was like visually underwhelming and low key immature like it didn t it it s like they didn t give a A A it s like they didn t know what they had at their disposal and they like were like oh girls it d be so funny if you like stalked courtney for a day and it s like would it i mean they re A A do i really want to watch a couple of year olds stalk their sister the answer is yes because i did but it s also like that s what your story producers are contriving like whatever and that s i m sure why they left their contract was up and they re like we probably want to show a different or more real side and elevate it up a little bit they re A A billionaires and we re literally watching them like just drives their this drives no what i m saying though is like they re A A billionaires and that all he could come up with was get in your A A range rover and stalk your sister yeah the more fascinating element is the business behind all of them yeah and how they re running their day to day and what it really looks like i don t need to watch them A A crunching on a massive salad i don t although that health nut salad is good i overdid the health nut salad and it started making me sick and then what s happening with kanye and coachella i heard he was like no thank you i heard he left and is being now replaced by bruno mars because bruno mars and his partner i forget their name forgive me but they want a bunch of uh grammys and they they ve produced all the songs that are on the radio right now and they are really great songs so i think bruno is replacing him in the headline i saw is that he was um i think demanding sounds harsh but requesting the same like million dollar payday that kanye was getting so it would be interesting to see like because if you bought a coachella ticket to see yeah so it s just an interesting dynamic but i m not going to coachella so i guess it doesn t really matter to me i don t know but i drove past it i didn t realize it was so all it was so deep is it already said like setting up no like i drove by a freeway exit that says coachella oh right should we go to coachella no chella televipes i don t know i m just let s chella morgan wants to chella too let s cello with morgan you want a cello i kind of want to chill out come on we re about to have A A babies i want to go to carly rae jepsen i saw her at the troubadour when it was everything like maybe a decade ago i went to i saw her at la pride maybe a decade ago let s go to cella with morgan i love carly ray jepson do you really oh my god are you kidding me i did not know this about you what what do you mean what i m the biggest kylie ray jefferson fan i have two albums on my phone and one of them is carly rae jepsen really yeah which one the first one yeah i think emotion uh let s take a look because i don t know the names of them underrated for sure absolutely underrated phenomenal artist um okay so you wanted to talk about jojo siwa jojo see what cut her hair off oh i have two all that and give me love oh yeah both fantastic oh no they re emotion yeah but those are the two sides right cool let s go to chella okay maybe i m always trying to get you to go cut two a A A chella is happening you re texting me i m on the toilet you re like why aren t we at cellar right now no that was the justin bieber concert i know that s what i m saying i wanted to go i ve always i always wanted to go to the justin bieber concert i just didn t want to execute when you did rylynn come on we re getting older we re gon na have A A babies let s go to chella we ll talk about it no we will be going that is final as sure as roosters sit on eggs you and i shall be at chella this year okay on to jojo jojo jojo cut all of her A A hair off and lizzy scream texted me well and then when i didn t respond fast enough i got a bunch more scream text messages because it s a big deal i just love that you re jojo s most passionate follower i love judges and lizzy threatens to walk from the podcast all the time if i don t request her to come out for god s sakes jojo get on the show i just feel like she s busy like now she s no she s so she was announced to be the judge of dancing with the or so you think you can dance too which is awesome like A A yeah she just keeps getting these like big because these really are like big hollywood moves in my opinion yeah she s getting she guest hosted the ellen show multiple times she s often running she s all the way there and she cut all her hair off yeah i don t know i wonder if it was a low key britney move because she had all those extensions and she needed like a fresh start i i think there were more more there was more at play with brittany yeah there was more play with brittany but no matter what it was all triggered by her hair extensions and maybe like a katy remember when katy perry did this oh yeah yeah cut it all off i think if it makes her happy it didn t mean it makes her i thought she looked when she was talking about not being invited to the kids choice awards i it i it was like a vibe you know i get what she was going for for sure oh it s so cute she s like curling it or she s like flipping it up yeah adorable i agree and she has all those rhinestones on her ears that look like piercings i didn t notice that oh yeah her mom i guess has a rhinestone company go figure jojo siwa s mom has a rhinestone company of course of course they do and they re always like rhinestone and hats i want to hang out dude i ll be weird for a few months but eventually i ll get used to the siwa vibe and i won t be a starstruck by everyone but like have me over to rhinestone some A A please jojo please jojo i love you okay let s talk about elon musk uh buying up twitter what a boss ass A A move yeah he really and did you see so elon musk bought what like percent of twitter no like more than half the shares of twitter i thought it was no i think that might be how much money he spent on it let me because i heard that so because he owns more shares in twitter than jack dorsey well jack dorsey stepped down and now he only owns or something i was watching videos on it this morning but what i thought was fascinating is he was in talks to join the board and now he has since pulled out and people are speculating he pulled out because uh when you re a board member you cap out at percent of owning the company because it s like you want to keep the company s best interest at all right stake in the company and so he didn t join the board supposedly because you max out at a certain point and and the big play people are speculating is that he wants to just take over twitter altogether to regulate free speech in a better way to make the platform more fit for how he sees it i think uh it s more about deregulating it and allowing for more free speech that s right that s what i mean no no yeah you did but the word regulate i just was right taking a step further because what s interesting is the notion of the public square which we used to all be able to gather like the world used to be so small that you could gather almost everybody in the in the town together and say like let s talk about this A A and come to like what what do a majority of us want but that s kind of physically impossible now right and so you know with the creation of social media you find the spread of information to be much greater and more valuable and powerful so if these tech companies can decide what is allowed to be said and not said they are now the source of what is being consumed or and what is free speech and what is off limits which is insane right because that s part of our constitutional rights which are protected by the constitution the supreme court and all and in our government checks and balance systems but if jack dorsey or twitter gets to say that A A is out of line that s the end of the conversation right and that s wild yeah no i agree with you and i think uh it will be i m sure he has a larger plan at play that will soon be revealed yeah and um i mean elon is elon so anything is possible he s wild he d be a wild boy he d do be wild in and yeah i just think it s very fascinating because yeah what a time to be alive wow we re going to coachella elon musk owns twitter not yet well we re not at coachella yet either but did you see his tweets he was like and he makes a good point he was like your most influential people on twitter rarely if ever even tweet and i think twitter has become a place of just i think toxicity i know i think it s yeah a lot of information but i definitely think it needs a a revamp and if elon musk is going to be the one to i don t know if i ll ever come back honestly so it doesn t really twitter me either yeah i ve never i ve never comprehended twitter i ve never been on it but i do know that like social media accounts play a huge role in massive political affairs like we talked about it when we went uh through that documentary what was that called the social dilemma yeah the social dilemma and then you also think about like huge political movements like the arab spring like a great deal of that information was spread online it s important for people to be able to rally and communicate freely and governments do oftentimes because it s like this one little entity that you can essentially flick a switch on like you could flip the switch on twitter and all of a sudden it s gone and there s no way to communicate you know what i m saying and i think people would find other ways to communicate they will always find other ways to communicate but there are countries like in china the social media is so heavily restricted right that there isn t really freedom of speech in that regard yeah so it really is like the wild west of like imagine if martin luther s thesis that he like steamed put on the A A church building that one day had just been deleted right you know what i mean like that s A A crazy so i think it s really important and interesting that everybody start realizing that like when somebody says something like i defend your right i may not agree with what you re saying but i defend your right to say it because the second we start eroding those rights we find ourselves on a slippery path to not being you know yeah you know like a we re we re then living in an artificial bubble that s essentially the giver which scares the A A out of me yeah yeah i mean the yes and it yeah i can t even fathom i mean i guess not in this multiverse you know what i m saying my sin player is not here for that the dumbest people on the internet right now chickens don t A A so let us tell you about paul chickens don t A A and other musings from lizzie and ryland at the sim do you want to make me take that narcissist test well it s questions so i m almost thinking it needs to be the whole second half of our show next week like hot dog questions yes but i think it s gon na be fascinating so i really fell down the rabbit hole of dr drew and just talking about social behavior and narcissism and lizzie often jokes on this show like oh i m a narcissist so i thought it would be interesting to take the test because although you have i think traits that could be uh construct construed as narcissistic traits i mean i do think it s narcissistic that i relate all timelines to my own existence but i also think you re very even if you are i think you re very self realized because of what you ve gone through and the things that you ve educated yourself on through addiction like i think that yeah also other people s pain does not bring me pleasure so if somebody is going to be distressed or uncomfortable it doesn t serve me right and all those kinds of things are in the questionnaire but it is questions and i think it s going to take like minutes so i think do you want to talk about the ultimatum because that A A made me sick all weekend yeah oh my god do you know what the premise is no so the ultimatum is the new show on netflix from nick lachey and his wife oh i did i saw this when i was scrolling and i m like so now they re just is this a real is it reality oh it s reality so these real ass couples who have been in long term relationships one person in the relationship is like either you marry me or you get the A A out so they come on the show with that ultimatum either you marry me or we re done so a bunch of couples show up with that ultimatum one partner is ready to be married the other is not they divide and all those couples then start dating each other so one boyfriend and one girlfriend from one couple will then start dating in another group and they get to choose at the end of like a week of like speed dating do you want to live with this person as your fake wife or are you ready to propose your partner and a couple people actually or one person got engaged at the dinner where everyone s choosing their new fake wife everybody else has a new partner and they go live with that person for three weeks and they A A sleep in the same bed they re playing house they re kissing were the couples coming into this real couples to begin yes that is with years of history i mean i guess i can t judge anyone else s i was sick i was texting joe like i m having a hard time breathing like this feels like a toxic thing for me to be watching they start kissing they bring their new partners to their homes to meet their A A family and friends these moms are meeting these new girls like it s wild the audacity the audacity and then all the boys get together and go out for drinks and all the girls get together and go out for drinks and some girls are like yeah your boyfriend got hard in bed with me and i kissed your boyfriend off camera because he didn t want you to know we were kissing and then the boys are in another A A chapter together where they re all like getting into weird A A talks about like your girl deserves this and your girl deserves that like honestly like i see a future with your girl and i m just sitting there like one girl s like i A A him raw dog every night and this other girl at the table s like i m in love with your boyfriend and i m just like what the A A they re saying wait for it then at the end of that three weeks they have to go back to their original partner and spend three weeks with them and they each have to like they each want to tell each other yeah i kissed so and so like yeah we cuddled it s like we saw on camera that you got your A A dick yanked like this asking for your relationship to be destroyed exactly i was like that s why i m i m sure it s great reality television but their motives to go on in the first place make me question like oh it s so more important to them than their relationship at hand because how else could you convince me in a healthy relationship to go on obviously their relationship s not healthy because you have to like agreeing to go on a show like this is so bad A A crazy and toxic and like going to your partner and saying i want to take you on a show where we re gon na split up for three weeks we re gon na A A some other person they don t have to A A but i do feel like a lot of them did A A honestly it s A A it s uh and then they didn t air the final episodes so you don t know who got engaged and who didn t and some people have the option to leave with the person that wasn t their partner that they spent three weeks with and so when s that coming out god knows it s probably on netflix i just haven t seen it because i m a little bit stupid right now i m gon na have to check that out it literally made me so sick i have to show you the pictures i was sending to the my friend joel i was like joel i m not right like this is so A A look at me that i looked like the whole time i couldn t breathe i was so disturbed i hated every moment of it i was like oh my god texting joe this A A is wild i made joe come and i was like if this ever happened to us you better believe i m not A A kissing like it would just happen to you like i m saying someone s like in a sauce scenario they re like cut out your ingrown toe or spend three weeks with a stranger i d be like i m spending three weeks with a stranger but joe nobody s A A kissing i m not looking at them i m in a A A corner crying and beating my head against the wall that is not the type of A A i want my oh my my chest hurts right now thinking about it it A A me up all day all day okay i m gon na watch that this weekend i spent my weekend watching severance on apple tv plus yeah and it A A with me as well this is scripted and um what s his name adam scott well he s the actor but um oh my gosh i can t think of the man that s producing it oh i m the worst ever it will come to me the pawdience will tell us yeah he s a big celebrity ben stiller ben stiller he produces like dramatic heavy yeah things now and it s the whole premise is like it struck a chord with me because my brother has a job where he s not allowed to talk about his job outside of his job because he hasn t exactly austin talks about it with me just kidding sorry austin if that got you killed i m really sorry like he can t austin doesn t talk to lizzy about austin doesn t talk to me about his work um and i made that up because i was like but you can t even take a phone like if you walk into the building with the phone and go through the metal detector they take that they will fire you oh because they re thinking you re trying to like get you know yeah and so this this concept takes it to the next level where they actually put a chip in your brain where you can t um fathom you can t you can t process the information outside of work you don t haven t like you have an inside work life and an outside work life which is so A A up because then your inside work life only sees like coming back down the elevator and working so they re in like a never ending work because they don t remember what they re doing on the outside and the outside doesn t remember what they re doing on the inside and then it s obviously abusive on the inside and it s just so mind fucking and crazy i also like it hypothetically speaking we re in a world where that s the reality i don t think that s con i don t think that s a productive choice for the company because sometimes i get inspiration for my work life from my personal life so if i were to have to have those two things split well i think they re doing kind of they don t know what they re doing inside right but i m it s like if you think about like the fibonacci code or like whatever that weird ass sequence is like that you can find in nature like this the circle in the shell and the things like that like sometimes you can even get mathematical inspiration or physics inspiration or chemical and for inspiration from just being in nature and being in public and you can make connections to things based off of what s happening in your life so if you re closing off that side of the brain you re kind of limiting the amount of the brain that you have during work i understand what you re saying but theirs is like they re they re clumping clusters of numbers that evoke feelings to them so they don t even know what they re doing inside of work and most people that get into the work something very traumatic has happened in their outside life and their outer life that makes them want to forget their day for eight because it s very like there s people on the street like protesting doing it and then the people on the inside like maybe their wife got in a car accident and died or and they want to just like shut off the world for x amount of time take three and so it takes a second to get keep going joe just responded to me vomiting this morning we haven t talked since i threw up he said i did hear that and then i heard you sounding fine moments after and was like she must have been brushing her teeth back to this um so the first episode it takes a second to get into but then it s so haunting and crazy and leaves on cliffhangers every episode that you re just like oh my god but i m having like nightmares because it s not a scary show like it s not like a scary show but it s a very disturbing and it s disturbing in the sense that it s like overruling my dreams even and making my dreams really A A up scenarios because of how A A up i think the show is wow i m gon na have to watch that it s pretty fantastic and i think apple plus is putting out really good shows and people are like not making the view charts like that well it s because they re so isolated but i mean i think they re the cheapest streaming service of them all right but it s like i m i ve scarcely well i m not watching regular television so i guess i m not the and i love the morning show i guess apple tv haters and i like hulu a lot too they re really they keep coming out with all these bangers of shows yeah hulu s killing and they never but they don t make the like i watch a girl that does like the ratings on everything every week and who is rarely if ever making the charts on minutes watched per week really shocking tom and pammy was in there pam and tommy whatever was in for like one week on its premiere and then one other show but really not often wow and amazon prime makes it more often but i think that s just because everyone has prime so they like watch it i don t i can t think of a single prime show that i thought was like titillating i think upload s cute oh i have no idea what the A A that is it s cute okay okay what s your steve um oh and then the last thing i know we re going on kind of long but uh j lo s engaged oh right that was the top i don t know how we missed it it must be on the previous page i mean do we care i m you are more of the gen ben stan than me and my angle was more so like a business woman this A A she s directing no i mean i think it s weird but it is like she s a businesswoman she directed her engagement announcement to her website she did like a dramatic video being like you got ta go to the jlo because this is a story for my jloers like my wait i didn t even know this she directed it like you had to go to her before like all the news outlets picked it up and told the story for her it was very much like you had to go to her website sign up for her thing and then i don t think it s behind a paywall but you re now like in in her jlo her inner circle whoa she used her engagement as a blog link and to each their own i don t think that invalidates their love for one another i just know it wild though it was wild and then like she s our i wonder what she had me thinking about her previous engagement rings and like we still got to do that rundown how crazy would it be if she like i m being crazy i can t speculate that she went all this way all this distance to make alan alex rodriguez jealous i highly doubt she s engaged to make somebody jealous i m not saying engage but like the relationship do you think it started that way no because she was with ben before and i didn t know that they ever they never got married to begin with no i wasn t following the zeitgeist then so no they never got married to begin with and they i did see her statement being like there was just so much public scrutiny and we didn t yeah so they re keeping this private yeah so i respect her for that and i really hope them the best like i hope this is it for both of you i just think that like i hope to god he s doing it well i hope he s okay and the sometimes he looks a little rough yeah i mean nobody ever looks great besides j lo and paparazzi photos i mean right there is that famous picture of ben where he s like oh with the cigarette yeah i hope he s okay i do too and i i um one other talking point among that was like with previous rings christelle stouse from selling sunset which i love she was on kelly clarkson and she was talking about didn t they break up who christelle and her oh no she just got her ex but she was married to justin hartley who s on this is us who then cheated on her and married the i believe cheated on her but he left her he like told her via text that they were getting a divorce via text jesus and like for her like she really had a glow up since then like she s the star of the most popular netflix reality show right now she s on she was on dancing with like she s really killing it yeah um and she revealed that she sold her ring from him and put that on the down payment of her new dream home that she s moving in now wow hell yeah A A he did her dirty and she was like i m gon na cash in on that race good for her i thought it was interesting and i still do that this is us every week i m one of those that s still i m still sticking with this is us and i still like ugly cry in my room to it every single week i love that for you so that s that that s the zip click goodbye see you next week for narcissism Music you
Music so Music hello you guys and welcome to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay but i m not home okay you guys i m homesick i m sick with coven lizzy called me yesterday and she s like i have a sore throat i was like well then you re not getting on a plane tomorrow and she s like no i have allergies because the seasons are changing and it s different weather and i said uh i don t know about that and she calls me a couple hours later and goes so i took a test and she s absolutely positive she s staying home for the next five days you know what is infuriating i feel like you just had coronavirus so are you getting different strands of coronavirus we thought i had covid but you re forgetting the plot twist that i took a test then and it was negative and i was just tired god yeah you don t even know me and also do you want to tell the audience you didn t even follow me on youtube you A A well i do follow you on youtube but i have three different accounts so i had not gone in on every single account and followed your youtube channel i m so sorry but when i went to promote it this morning i saw that i wasn t following you so i made sure to hit follow i subscribed and i m living loving and enjoying what you have going on i can t believe you followed through because this has been something you ve been talking about for months and months and months and you finally pulled the trigger i guess that s not the right terminology we should be using anymore i thought it was fine until you called it out um i know well i heard myself say it and i go oh this is a thing we probably shouldn t be saying anymore that s something we should rest um what is in my i just have like hair in my mouth oh just get covered all over touch i licked all the handles like don t think i m not trying to share i didn t lick any of your handles chill out yeah i mean the reason why we announced it is because i knew i d A A out unless you left it in the podcast it s a scary thing to do you still made it happen it is it s a vulnerable place to be to put yourself out there in that sort of way and how are you feeling what was the process like do you like being a vlogger girl did you have fun editing was it a nightmare does it feel like a job are you having fun um i think i think it gave me covet you think logging gave me A A comment no i m just kidding um i like i think it s really good i think it s good for me because i stopped doing anything like i just got violently depressed and all i was getting ready for is the podcast and now we only do that two times a month basically it felt like it was good for me to get up and do something besides like sleep and cry no yeah do you want to go into that at all or is that just is it too touchy of a subject and they can watch your vlog it s however you re feeling honestly i don t want to push something that doesn t yeah you can watch my vlog um no it s just it s A A awful like everything hurts like you even asking that hurts like waking up hurts going to bed hurts making breakfast hurts uh not making her breakfast hurts the most and yeah it s A A awful dude it s awful i m trying not to cry on the podcast too because then it s just like what is this crying everywhere and i just keep hearing tom hanks saying there s no crying in baseball i m so sorry and there s just there s nothing that can really i guess time is the only thing and even time it s just like how can you not feel A A up about it at all times i mean oh it s yeah it s awful we can move on i started my second vlog and it s different vlog yeah it s my covenant vlog instead of my crying vlog it s my covered vlog like what the A A man i was telling my sim club this morning like chill out bro they must think this is like funny you know what i mean like they just must be like a nihilist up there being like guess what i did to my sim today like i A A her even harder and gave her coven like what they are just pounding you while you re down because didn t your car break down as well yeah dude mike i don t have a car right now and the tesla just got more expensive so i can t even get a A A tesla and they took away the rebates they hiked up the prices took away the rebates so now yeah tesla s are now unaffordable and how am i not supposed to take that personally like how is that not about me at this point in time like honestly honestly how is it not about me riddle me that how are they gon na take that electric joy away from you and honestly everyone i don t think it s tesla s fault i think the government puts a cap on because they try to get new companies that are going electric um an incentive but now that they ve sold over a million cars is why i believe the incentive has now gone away but just to double down now that gas prices have gone through the roof tesla s like well everyone wants a tesla i guess we should raise the price additionally A A them man like i need a break i need a A A break and if that break wants to come in the form of a tesla like amen sam god god damn ugh elon if you re listening oh and of course my gardeners are here now dude that s how it goes that s happy sometimes how it is you know i got i think today we do need to read our horoscopes because some funky shit s going on in the world for both of us and we re taurus girlies so maybe like i mean i m not comparing myself my bad misfortunes mishaps to yours but i i m just having like glitches in the road you know it s just like what s going on yeah what s going on you got mad at shane well do you want me to rob him because i m sitting here right now and i see merch i want can i just do you want me to take this and A A him if that s what will make you feel better like publicly supporting the man i m viewed no i m kidding uh we went to a restaurant last night because we thought a date night could be fun and um it was kind of a disaster for the majority of it and not just because the two of us but like speaking of kovid we sit down and there s like a group of like it was like a three a triple date like three couples on a date together all three women were on one side all three men were on the other they were probably in their mid s and from the moment we sat down these girls were hacking and yakking like it sounded like coveted coughs like i know like people have smoker s coughs or they have allergy coughs but this they weren t uh even as sensitive to the fact that they were next to anyone like no going into the shoulder or trying to cover it up at all and at first i thought maybe she swallowed her wine wrong and like that happens and i get that like an aggressive cough like that happens if you swallow wrong but it continued on for minutes and i go we re so close to them and i said shane we ve got to move and he goes well now we ve sat next to them for minutes if we ve gotten covered we ve gotten covered and i was like but if we haven t why would we want to prolong our probability of getting it now and so the waiter comes over and i m like uh hi i hate to be this person but can we get the A A out of here we actually know you were like straight right oh hi uh excuse me and so we so awkwardly get up and they just watch us pick all of the things up from our table and move and so whatever i m like i m gon na get a drink now because i can t fathom them all looking at me and wondering well they shouldn t be wondering why we moved because they were coughing and giving us coveted all over the place and i just was not there for it like A A that i understand if you have a cough and if you have a cough and you re in public and you have to cough just like be polite about it and go into your shoulder but whatever so i get a lemon drop martini because i ve been craving a martini for a while like i ve had a week i don t know why but it s just like i m stressing what what s a martini you re talking to a girl who quit drinking before she could afford bars like i can t tell you the exact ingredients but i believe it s like sixty seventy percent alcohol with like a little bit what else so it s got um it was vodka with i m assuming some sort of lemon liqueur and uh i didn t anticipate how much it was gon na A A me up i have a superstition about drinking on nights before the podcast and really only podcasting because like vlogging i only vlog when i feel like it vlogging is like when i feel right or when i feel happy or when something s going on that i feel is something i should document i vlog but for the podcast i want to be like the most awake the most alert i want to be on top of it and you know like quick and i feel like sometimes if you re hungover whatever because sometimes one glass of wine will give me a hangover i ve been talking for so long now but anyways it s a superstition of mine to not drink and i feel like i thought problems into existence because i decided to drink on a work night are you telling me uk people what your alcoholism gave me kovid you manifested i don t know it feels like the day before a show you chose to drink and i got sick you got covered before i went out and gone i m not a doctor but it definitely feels like i got covered when you were exposed to the lemon drop martini so because i had drink in the lemon drop martini shane didn t drink anything and normally with one drink it s like fine you you get it at the beginning of dinner you re fine to drive an hour later one drink yeah one drink that you normally process in one hour and you normally sit at dinner for longer than that um so i but i got out and i was like wasted that checks out i literally was talking about you this weekend to my friends i was like it s weird rylan has like a walk like he wafts a white wine and all of a sudden this A A is loosey goosey like it s because i don t drink frequently like i drink maybe once a week but this lemon drop martini hit different and i am the driver in our household like i feel like most households have a driver and that just so happens to be me so i m like i don t know shane i m pretty drunk and like i m not risking anything so you ve got to drive and so he s like kind of annoyed at me that he has to drive and because i m a little bit buzzed at this point like i don t want anyone to be my buzz kill because i m like haven t had a drink in a while i m riding this like little buzz that i got going on i m ready to just like be loud and listen to loud music and have fun the tesla gps like it was like a four split freeway and it didn t clearly tell him exactly which one he needed to be on so he got off on the wrong one and then he was mad that like the tesla gps wasn t working as though it should and so then i felt like my mood had been ruined so i get all angry at him for ruining the volume like you just need to get at me that the gps didn t work so then i realized that me being a little too drunk i like picked a bigger fight than i should have but we re not going to admit that to him unless he s listening to the podcast i loved it you just looked for him before you admitted that you were never going to apologize for your actions you sick A A i mean he did make me mad because it ruined my little my little buzz that i had going on so then i started thinking wow the superstition is real if i thought it into existence or not me having a drink before a work night is not something i m allowed to do and then i started going and spiraling about other superstitions do you have any yeah i think i can prep you for this but no whatever i not to make it sad i took off my j necklace and jelly died that was a superstition i know isn t that A A i remember taking it off too i was like i shouldn t do this took it off that s bad yeah so that s real maybe i should put it back on to make sure joe doesn t die or maybe i should never put it back on in case i put it on and take it off and then joe will die i don t know i m not sure i m not trying to risk it so you asked yes i do have psychotic superstitions another one is what i mean uh yeah and i don t like to talk about bad feelings i have like if i have a feeling something s gon na go wrong i don t like to say it out loud because i feel like it manifests it but then i have like a psychotic spiral where i m like but if i don t say it it will come true because i m giving it power but i m usually wrong about bad things if i say them out loud first so i should say it out loud first and then i m also like a witch who s like A A there s weight to my words and i just put that in the universe and now the universe is gon na throw it back at me like a boomerang so yeah i m i m insane i have some superstitions it s hard it s hard to be in this mind and that creates the worst sort of anxiety for me personally at least when i feel like something s about to go wrong but i can t pinpoint exactly what it is but then i spiraled that whatever s wrong is gon na happen is gon na happen so it ruins my entire day unless i can get out of that like mental spiral into oblivion but when i started thinking about it we also uh somebody in our life gifted us uh like this beautiful like elegant money tree have you ever seen those before yeah they re like these braided trees that are supposed to make a great house coming into your life yeah and that s what it was somebody gave it to us when we moved into colorado into the colorado house and and then somebody else walked into my house and they go oh my gosh those uh while they re so beautiful are very toxic to cats like you re just gon na slide yeah and that s what i ve been doing lately even oh my gosh sending flowers has been a nightmare recently because now i m like well if the person has a cat i ve got to find something beautiful but something that s also cat friendly and it turns out like all the flowers in most bouquets are not cat friendly which is frustrating because i think every florist should have a cat friendly section so that when i m searching their site because i had a breakdown spending an hour searching for flowers i was like why am i spending an hour searching for flowers anyway this is just things that i do with my life so i tried planting the money tree outside because i didn t want it to go to waste but i wanted to still like have it grow and bring me good things but i guess with the colorado weather it just didn t take so long i don t think it s coming back why don t you say that money tree gave me covet you A A it all circles back to elizabeth gordon really quickly i think we should save what we have and then come back with a fresh recording for safety um okay because we re manifesting a A A storm of A A today s podcast is sponsored by calm it s time for a break and technically this is an ad

well lizzy s uh slowly leaving us what are you feeling what are your symptoms because this broke for you yesterday right so do you think it only gets worse from here or is it going up from here um it s it s like up and down so far so like it started with a really sore throat and nothing else like literally no other symptom and then a fever crept in yesterday which was why after i talked to you i was like oh i should take another test so i took another test and instead of doing a nasal swab i did a throat swab and the the throat the throat culture came back positive and then i had i got hit hot and heavy with a fever and then basically just went to bed and then woke up this morning and was like okay i was actually like oh i m great like i m fine and then like slowly it was like no here s your fever again A A and then like the fever spiked and then now it s like the fever is breaking again so i m like sweaty and clammy but like at least i m not like achy and cold yeah thanks for A A up the money tree which is ruining my life it seems like it s really going around again morgan just got it too and it was like five days of just being isolated in her room so i guess while maybe not as severe for most people right now i feel like there s another wave but people are just still living their lives because now they re like well it s kind of equates to a cold so i guess we re just going to keep on living yeah i mean i m i m like i said like i m vlogging today and at first i just thought i had a sore throat because when i was at the airport the other day someone was just smoking a cigarette in the bathroom and i was like does my road hurt because i was exposed to smoke did your throat constantly hurt when you were a cigarette smoker yeah like my throat feels like how it did when i was a smoker that s why i m like oh nothing s new here i m used to living in agony and slightly hungover sad sad girl things also what a great thing this podcast did for your life i know you were ready but still i forget like how great we are for doing that together really thanks carrie okay so speaking of your weekend you were at the airport because well you caught covid because this wasn t because of my superstitions gone wrong this is because you went and threw a baby shower and one of the people i guess so happened to have covet or somebody you encountered at the airport who really knows who could ever really say um yeah great baby shower as i always say it s not a baby shower unless there s covid present um i m joking guys i don t go with no laughing matter but jesus like what am i supposed to do at this point just keep crying and so you planned it i planned it i threw it i barely planned it this woman denise at pretty tea parties in walnut creek planned it she A A knocked that A A out of the park did you get the pictures of course it was a theme yeah it was so cute everybody got a fancy tea party hat there were tiny sandwiches and we all got to pick our tea and there was like a throne for the baby mama to be sitting in and like bassinets and i had a big ass baby bottle with a bunch of hershey kisses and people have to guess what s in it and i did famous like guess the famous baby that was really fun can you give me an example well honestly let s let s play one i accidentally uh put hitler on the poster and did not know it i don t i don t know if this is it was just an accident so i thought it was a little bit funny like i didn t realize it until i came home and her husband was looking at the poster and he goes who s this and i go oh it s so and so he goes no dude that s hitler and i was like what he goes yeah and he googles hitler s baby picture and it s that baby i didn t know it was so was this put together outside of you i don t understand how this going to be i did it but i was taking baby pictures off pinterest of famous people and i had like babies and so i was and i was like at the airport while i was doing it i m like multitasking and like all i did was type in a search like baby pictures of like jennifer aniston baby pictures of like uh you know morgan freeman baby pictures of brad pitt babe you know all of that so like i m just so how did this come to fruition it was just an accident i just screen grabbed the wrong baby because it was just a search like a A A yeah and what s even crazier is one girl did guess hitler and i said no you re wrong oh my god and then i got home and katie s husband was like you re dumb as rocks and i said i might be i might very well be but other than that the game was very good and when s the baby coming out is that when do you have a baby shower like how close to popping do you do this kind of event i think it s safe to say you do it like the month before the last month so she s due in august so we did it at the end of june so she has all of july to be aggressively uncomfortable and largely pregnant she severely regrets being pregnant over the summer which is kind of funny because i plan to be pregnant over the summer you crazy girl well got ta have that fourth of july baby um oh okay what you thought was funny really like offended me and i was gon na go into it on text but then i thought well i don t wan na you re literally gon na pick beef with me right now i mean yeah you re the one that still i was gon na cancel the podcast for you and you were like no we could still do it um which i understand oh god we text so much am i ever gon na be able to find out i know what you re talking about because you re a little A A i know but i wanted to find out i ll tell you i ll tell you verbatim what it says i showed joe my vlog before i posted it and he paused it on your well wishes and said why is he talking like that you take offense to that and then lizzy goes so maybe you can teach me your vlog voice inside of one of my videos and i was like first of all that s so mean to say that that isn t a version of myself like i m faking it for the internet do you because i don t think that that hi girlies it comes with like an upper a higher pitch with a wiggly finger and if you re telling me you don t do that you re tripping off the rector no i think that in exciting i don t think it s any different than excitable moments inside of this podcast i think it fluctuates between like how i talk but i think that s how my vlogs are too like if i m in conversation i think that it s like even toned and level but yeah if you re introing the vlog or if you re like if you re starting if you re starting a clip you re obviously going to bring energy to it because why would somebody want to watch something that s like a snore fest nobody wants to watch me go hey guys so lizzy started a youtube channel hope you enjoy it no you need to bring some enthusiasm you got to be like oh my gosh you guys lizzy started and it s not unreal because it is like i have excitement around you starting a youtube channel so why wouldn t i get excited with the people that are watching so i don t think it s like a fake what i just can i say something yeah i never said it wasn t real that s an insecurity that you seem to be projecting very heavily right now i just i think it goes back to a lot of people with their voice inflections in general mean a lot i mean that s why the theranos woman put on her boy guys because she wants to have so when you say it to me it makes me feel as though i m being inauthentic with those who are watching or consuming so i think that s what like hits the nerve with me right i would like to say i don t think it s inauthentic i do think it s different from your normal speaking voice and i and to title it i call it a vlogger voice and you re not the only vlogger who does it also yorig s your example of a boring vlogger voice is my vlog A A you and you spoiled next week s podcast or a bit that i plan to do in the future when i see you again so who s really been wronged today i can still teach you because here s the thing it s no different than when i and intro this show when it s like it s obviously different than us talking right now because i m like hello you guys and welcome to another episode of the sip like you re because to intro so i guess you re right we ll meet in the middle like it is it is um instant excitement but it s not that i m not excited no and i never claim to think it s disingenuous and i i like it so much that i want to emulate it but i can t find a way to authentically emulate it so you get me like rubbing my nose and i m like what hi hi everybody like my vlog intros when i m not crying are probably going to be something like i feel them today so i m going to do this voice welcome back well i don t have an intro to my i liked i liked you into in the pool like you re weird in the pool moments that like cuts to the people or you like showing your ass that your jeans are writing up i thought your vlog was very fun i thought a lot of elements of your vlogs and as you keep going i think you re going to be a really great vlogger girl not saying this vlog wasn t but i think like this is fun for you yeah and if you guys haven t subscribed already i don t know what you re doing go subscribe go hang out with lizzy go see what s going on behind the scenes when we re not podcasting you know go see like whatever kitchen looks like go cry come cry with me let s cry let s cry away but i will take so like joe joe has seen like i talked to joe as a human in person so i guess if a straight man who has encountered me in person is jolted by my internet voice maybe i need to have some reflecting i need to do and maybe that s my real problem no i don t think there s any problem to it i think the only thing you have to do is find the self confidence to continue to be yourself well and i felt like i was being accused of not being myself no that s a twist you added and i think that s just an insecurity from being like a gay guy whose voice who like used to have like a straight er voice that like i don t know if was like that s the thing like i don t know if that voice was natural or not either or if it was just like subconscious what was what well i was just gon na say first of all you as a human being are A A phenomenal like you re funny you re absurd you re organized you work hard you re loving like you re a good man charlie brown and i also think except for when it comes to money trees you re a A A death sentence which somehow has gone what i was gon na say i think this is an interesting way to bring up the austin butler stuff oh my gosh internet yeah the internet is tripping over this man s voice now because apparently it has changed i didn t even know it was such a widespread um point of interest i i had only like popped up on my recommendations of him like i ve wanted to see the elvis movie what i ve seen of like the trailer and different promotional materials i ve wanted to see it and so i thought oh i should click on this interview of him on one of the late night shows and i clicked in and my mouth literally fell to the floor because i had seen him in like these teen show like these teeny bopper shows before yeah and in interviews like back when i worked at clever he would make the rounds and it was like a light hearted bubbly like i m on a teen show and i m like a pretty boy and this was like out of this world i love it really i couldn t i mean no hate to him i think the movie s probably fantastic i bet his performance is fantastic but i was so weirded out i had to click and like it s slow it s like a slow burn and it s not for me and i like couldn t even stay there to hear what he was saying because i was so blacked out enraged that it was so slow yeah i get that you know what i mean yeah i get it uh let s save this video i need to go get some water i m sorry okay our coco queen needs a break i ll be back all right thank you for your patience while i grabbed a very berry lacroix god if only they would sponsor me sorry from us i ve been plugging them for like five years and i have well i guess i m on their pr list not for nothing i will take that i ll take what i can get i d love to get on their pr list because i m tired of just stealing the pr packages from your house so yeah to wrap it up i think the austin butler thing is a little bit like you know i was re watching something that you and i did that s on my youtube channel and we sound completely different too and neither of us ever trained our voice for two years to be different so no A A his voice is going to be a little bit different he doesn t know who the A A he is just like you were saying you struggled to understand where your natural voice lies because you felt like you were putting on for so long and now he s kind of the reverse right he s been putting on for so long that he s rediscovering his natural voice wow i am the A A it s not for me i guess maybe after i see the movie i ll feel differently maybe after i see him immersed inside of the character i will feel like wow i want to sit and watch this long drawn out drawn out breathy interview but i do agree with you i think he said he spent two plus years preparing for this role like walking inside of elvis shoes and so i have to respect him for the dedication that he put into this role which is in large part why i want to watch him do this so we will say i am the A A uh in some what the A A news uh you put in two stories that were kind of mind blowing yeah would you want to take it away well i don t know which ones you found might not have the document i am i told you to pull up the document before i m literally looking oh iced tea okay what the A A news well i see now i was she has covered i m sorry i was girl too i m apologizing i m saying i am the A A i m sorry my coveted queen okay so i m a coveted cutie um what the A A the earth is not round did you vote yes i clicked the link and i will say um because of tick tock i was shook this morning i m three years old i had no idea the tick tock i looked at is like tell me why i m years old you re a child thank god you re learning this in your infancy do you know how A A my mind is right now knowing now that earth is not round why has nobody told us this i blame our school system i really do they ve sold us a lie they ve shown us what the earth is time and time again they give us a little bit m s have us break through the three layers of it to tell us the three layers of the earth like all of it s a A A lie and i just don t quite understand even if that s the best way to present it for us to process why wouldn t they also show in the corner of all maps a realistic representation of what the earth looks like because i mean it makes sense when you think about it we re like a big huge rock floating through the atmosphere so like of course it would be more lumpy and rock shaped but i don t know what this means for us who could who could possibly know all i know is i literally know nothing they don t teach me about taxes they don t teach me what shape the earth is like is gravity real that is a damn travesty you know what if i could have had a tax class in school my life would have been a lot better we could have dropped something else i didn t need tennis badminton and walking i needed to learn how to A A taxes you A A are teaching us pickleball before you teach us the size of the A A or the shape of the earth i bet austin knew the shape of the earth i got a real austin s different than us he s part of the real world but who the A A is man what the A A like no one told i was like what i was like on the toilet i was like i got ta tell ryland like this is wild wild it is wild i was pretty shook i ve got ta say like it s not often you send me a tick tock and i have to think about it for a second but this one i truly did think about um so if you re listening to the audio version either google it or click onto the video so you can see what we re talking about we re talking about a little second A A rock hurtling through space that you live on um i guess it would make sense with like the mountain i mean the mountains would add to the curvature and like i knew that mountains were there and that s okay anyways i don t amazon says alexa amazon says alexa could soon imitate the voices of dead loved ones i didn t read into this because you didn t put a link i hate it well what does it mean exactly what it says bro they re gon na start using ai to replicate the voices of loved ones so that your alexa could sound like them and i A A hate it and here s another A A thing i ve been saving jelly s fur so that i could clone her when i m rich and then i googled it sorry no it s fine i literally have bags of fur in cabinets that say jellies fur for cloning and is that all you need no let me get let me finish my A A story jesus christ we listen to your lemon drop saga so i feel like i m one of those those couples that makes you pause the tv before the storyline happens and it s gon na happen but i m still asking what s gon na happen i mean we re both that we re both that part so i m fine with it um and then i was really upset and i was like well you know i do have i m not like broke like i used to be like maybe i could afford it so i google and i can t find the cost of what it is to clone my pet but i did see that in order to do it i need at least an ear and i can t think of anything more A A traumatizing than retrieving a singular ear they were like put your put your loved one in a freezer and i was like um i don t think i can do it it s gnarly so bottom line is i would clone anyone and i would not have their ai voice on my amazon items i don t even use alexa anyways because it creeps me out she scares me it can t be any different than how our phones or computers listen to us but for some reason it feels a little more invasive the one week i tried to have one in my house and i know our phones do the same thing but because the alexa has such a big screen and it s in your kitchen everything i talk about an ad then pops up for in my kitchen and i m like not in my kitchen not here not now no unplug stop listening to me yeah i don t like it and also i feel like if it s ai a big part of people s like voices is their cadence like i think about barack obama and if i have his voice in my head my thoughts slow down maybe that s a good anxiety tactic have your anxious spirals in barack obama s cadence um let s be clear and concise and deliver the message and then like also has like these thumbs my dad does these he gesticulates with his thumbs pressed against his knuckles and just sort of yeah skis with them um anyways i wouldn t want that i wouldn t want what alexa thinks my loved one s voice cadence was like that sounds like a A A that s some pet cemetery A A and uh sorry for burping i m chugging this A A lacroix and i don t i don t want alexa period mm hmm she s out of my life we ve broken up um okay so now getting into our iced tea uh depp is said to potentially be in talks to return to pirates of the caribbean with a million dollar deal and i remember in the case he had said that there s no amount of money that would bring him back yeah i think he said even million dollars and he was like no he s like well let s talk and i think they re talking yep aren t they talking i think they re talking so it s a fascinating um Music uh turn of events because i i feel i feel as though like if you already have money like if money isn t a source of struggle for you is it worth your more like is it worth sacrificing your morals to go back i mean million dollars is million dollars so even yeah i don t know how much money you d have to have to be like no it would take a lot but the psychology behind it having a company drop you um take you away from a franchise that uh you made so much money for a company i think three or more of those films hit over a billion dollars so the fact that this one s probably gon na hit something cause it s the return if it is him like it s worth their investment it is but is it worth him going back to them would you be able for somebody that dropped you uh based on allegations would you go back to them i mean i guess the money yeah the money yeah all day all day and if they re if they re willing to roll out the red carpet if you slap me in the face with a handful of shane s diarrhea i would come back for million bro i d come back for so much less like it s not even it s not even a question you could do that and i ll be back next week for what i make now like i hope he goes back i hope he can see i mean the thing is the amount of people that would want to go support him being uh portraying himself as that character um getting the job back but i think what would be hard is knowing that this company dropped you in the heat of the moment without um but it s like hate A A you know like we already discussed that i have a bad sense of what hate A A means but it s like you A A me i A A you right back to the tune of million dollars i want a piece of the merchandise i want back end i want x y z items which i m sure he already has so if he can find it in his car as consensual where they re both gaining out of it um i just think it represents something bigger to me like if every person uh that had ever uh turned on us came back after it it just like i d still be like okay like but i still don t trust you with anything like uh you know well we don t have to be friends this is a business exchange right so i m saying if you can find it right so if it s consensual and he can get just as much out of it as they re getting from him i think it s great and i probably would take it if i was him if i m being honest you said you would cheat on shane for a million dollars no i don t think that s exactly the verbiage i think that s how people took it out of context no you re not i didn t post the question like that i didn t say i was going to cheat on him for a million dollars i said i was going to consult with him audience sound off in the comments below with time stamps and the episode of which ryland put his foot in his outfit said that yeah i m sure somebody s gon na circulate a clip maybe i did i don t know all i ever do is talk um okay haley bieber is uh getting sued while looking fabulous i just why it is like so haley bieber is being sued for a trademark for trademark infringement uh by a nine year old fashion company that shares the name of her skin caroline road which is bieber s middle name so uh rhode i guess has made their mark i don t think they re skin care but they re in all the luxury stores and they re a brand of their own and they re saying her coming out with this is damaging what they ve built and the reputation that they have now had with their customers for nine years but i just find it funny because like the picture um if you scroll down in our document i put it there for you but the pictures that they put of her every time they re putting articles of haley being serious just like are looking so fabulous well she always looks surprised i know but it s just like being sued when you re haley bieber doesn t seem so bad you know no i like i know it s annoying what no i was just gon na say i think it s hard to prove that using her middle name was ripping off another brand and it s also hard to prove that she s damaging their brand because honestly people are gon na probably accidentally buy their A A now yeah and she might be able to look at their cells after her brand if her their if that company s cells skyrocketed after she launched her brand because of some misconfusion they re going to have a very hard time saying oh well her coming out with this brand impacted us negatively yeah um but i do think it s kind of customary that you search um if there s other brands out in the market before you put something out but i can t imagine haley and justin have to have some of the best entertainment lawyers out there so i can t imagine she didn t seek a trademark of her own before going into a business like this because i know even all like the youtubers that start businesses they i started a trademark on my dog like yeah so i just think it was interesting i like i just it s funny to me to see like her looking so fabulous while they re coming out i know it s such a A A i didn t really understand you re gon na have to take over the next one because i don t know who this person is north or mcdonald s no meg yeah to talk about how sick A A north west s birthday party was camp north i can t believe we weren t invited of course oh sick on A A kim air north and all her girlfriends get shipped out to the wilderness where north teaches them how to do blood and gore makeup and they camp and go on the lake and have a great A A time north i might have said some nasty things about you in the past girl but i think we would be friends homie like that is my A A and good like that s cool it s cool for a little girl to be like i want to make some fake cuts and guts and blood well that s kind of yeah that s like that s what you like to do in your free time why are you saying she s an A A do you know her personally no i think it s like well known that like north is a little bit like i don t got time for you you know what i mean like this is not no you know what i mean well so the thing that was like a little excessive for me like i get if your mom has a private jet like take your friends on the private jet but kim s first post in the series of uh showing off the party was like a huge balloon bouquet over kim air and i just thought like god damn how how do the other parents even but they re rich as A A too you think all of north s friends are rich well i doubt all her parents have all her friends have jets but it s like how did she meet these kids do you think kim s like taking her to to my neighborhood and just like roaming i just still come friends for north i guess everyone has to live on their own path but i just find it funny like celebrities still get dragged for taking private jets so the fact that kim can just post her all of her kids going on a birthday party on her jet i mean more power to her it s good for her for not caring what anyone thinks because that is some kind of like uh even as rich as she is i don t know if i d be posting like my kids jumping on my private jet for uh their birthday party but to each their own and i m glad that she can do it honestly and i think society s always been interested in the rich and the famous like as far back as like tv goes people are always trying to televise and like expose what rich rich people do like not just rich but like rich rich like mega rich A A to be doing um and you know with social media we get an immediate glimpse into how the other one percent lives yeah a billionaire family my goddess well on to someone a little bit less lucrative but still someone i admire meg donnelly living her best A A life with zombies three and she s starring in the prequel to supernatural i don t that was like speaking spanish to me i don t understand any of it meg donnelly is this like young girl who for some reason i m obsessed with she was in this show called zombies or z o m b i e s and it s about zombies it s like high school musical but with zombies and regular people and um i watched it because when i was babysitting that little boy a kid in his class played opposite her his name is milo i don t know what his character s name is but then he was on dancing with the stars whatever i watched it with the little boy babysit shout out jonah who s A A now and uh fell in love with the zombies franchise they re doing zombies three and she was an actress on um american housewives and uh she s also a singer she s super cute if you like google mcdonnelly it s hard not to A A with mcdonnelly because she s the cutest and she s very sweet so what s the story here as sweet as this girl is she s just listening about her life i m just here to celebrate people who are doing what they love and succeeding at it is that so wrong i want to celebrate okay so we re looking forward to it um prequel of supernatural i think she s probably playing the mom from supernatural whatever you go mate A A ryland you go meg all right speaking of other people with new shows i guess kesha is going to be starring in a new discovery plus series uh called conjuring kesha where she goes to different haunted locations it gives me ptsd from when we used to do that on shane s channel because oh how often as those can be a lot we did that a lot over the span of like four or five years and while it s fun for everyone else i m just like oh i don t really want these spirits in my life but i do think kesha is a good fit for something like this and i watch the trailer and it seems pretty fun so i guess i ll tune in to at least one of the episodes the promotional images too look classy discovery plus they re coming through with money they re throwing money at people yeah did i ever tell you what did i ever tell you how sad i was when i got my wisdom teeth pulled and kesha didn t want them so when i went in to get my wisdom teeth pulled i like went going into it kesha was accepting teeth from people because she was in rehab doing art with teeth and when i came out of the surgery and came two i checked kesha s whatever and she d made an announcement saying please stop sending me your teeth i have enough and i just started crying Music this is personal it was sad sad um lizzie s other favorite person jojo siwa what but i ll still support her yeah but my other my other favorite my other favorite little blondie girl jojo siwa has a new tv show where she uh goes and tries things she couldn t do before because she s too public of a figure and one of the things she s going to try on the show is our podcast she s always been super famous into our podcast and now she can do it to be fair we ve never directly asked i i like to just correctly ask questions but she s not listening we haven t had like a direct line of communication with her but i guess yeah everyone s doing these facebook watch series cardi b has hers yeah so now jojo has hers and as jojo s biggest fan i was uh disappointed to learn that you didn t even realize that the show s already out the first episode where she takes pride is live i know it s so A A i don t even have facebook and i don t know how to access it to be completely i i wasn t even logged into a facebook account i just googled jojo i googled it and it popped up and i was able to watch the first episode you just googled it so i must be before we go uh we ve got to go but do you want to talk about what we re watching a fun little segment called what we re watching because you were talking about the hills i don t know like you re years too late but go off no i just think this A A is toxic as A A and i feel like you need to check in on your millennial female friends and make sure they re okay because we were raised by some A A and these A A are A A around with some dudes that are not A A nice to them and they re A A losers and these women are giving up their careers for these weird ass dudes and all it is is inspiring cattiness cheating and bullshittery and i have been watching for two weeks straight but i also have to say this is bad this is good i think if it s real though like i think they re further i think they might be demeaning themselves in order to further their stance in the reality show which puts them ahead in life but like kind of throws themselves to the waistline in the public perception it s not the waistline it s the wayside but what do i know i just have to over and i can t google jojo s ewa so well yeah you re sick like lizzy i had two recommendations for you guys to all watch while you re home um recovering uh hollywood house flip or hollywood house lift with jeff lewis did you ever watch flipping out back in the day no oh me either but uh now i m like jeff lewis is number one fan i m listening to a serious xm show every day it s like monday

Music thank you Music thank you he s gon na right here if that dog bites me I don t care honestly I don t I told Chris too don t laugh at him no you re kidding me you can t bring an evil entity right next to me and lower your voice and do not call my A A baby lover I m not gon na sacrifice the entertainment value of the podcast so that he can be like unaroused the fact that you re talking about arousing my dog is a bad look for you that s not what I m talking what would you say uh just don t laugh at him don t look at him don t laugh at him don t touch him okay no sudden movements arouse is the wrong word I don t want to get a rise out of him he s being a good boy he s having a good day no are you joking don t you A A dare don t you A A dare I will literally slap the A A out of you stop it okay Bob this is here the Instagram famous bubs Mr bubs do you not fear having like oh I told you Chris I clapped for him why does he hate Chris I don t know he hates me it s crazy because he really whenever I go to Lizzy s house whenever I go to your house it s nuts it s like I walk through the door and he s ready to bite my head off he walked into my house this morning and this A A couldn t have had more fun inside of that house he s rolling on the rug he s scooting he s giving his penis all over everything yeah so I just I I m a little confused about his emotional state he s a territorial boy he likes to protect his home and he likes to protect his mommy wife at all costs do you think he would let me pet him I wouldn t I wouldn t only because I don t it s like if he he does bite if the vet is afraid of him I should also that s not afraid of him he just has a bad rap on the internet so they flagged his file but he s a good boy I wonder who gave him the bad rep on the internet I Ozzy Osbourne I don t know that s crazy what it s not like it s his fault okay I had uh more bubs or is that okay um I don t know do you want more of your dog in the shot I mean I don t care he s happy okay whatever yeah I had a lesson in the devil last night I m just saying because what well okay wait really quickly welcome back to the SIP podcast hello you guys I m Ryland Adams of course joined by Elizabeth home okay and Mr Bubbles hello hello um no so half of what you post on Bub s account I honestly don t understand like your captions and like his Origins yeah I don t think I m educated enough to know like what it is like he speaks a different language than me yes he definitely does speak a different language he s very intelligent and he s Highly Educated so he s got a very he s got a vocabulary the likes of which I struggle to grasp personally and sometimes I also have to look up the words um but what s interesting is we when I got him I had named him earnest and now his full name is Ernest B Isle Bub s home okay and but his thing is is it what is what is his Origins like he s of the devil he is the Dark Prince and what does that mean does that correlate with the Down Under I mean he s he likes to to keep some mystery in his story but not no like I ve never known a dog to have this kind of power and authority and it s very sexy it doesn t like gives you you re not superstitious about it no because last night because he he only operates to protect me do you know what I m saying I m in a very good position like if this dog is the devil s A A Protege I am in a great A A spot to not be harmed well we were talking about Louie last night or the cat the new cat and he s so food crazed like when we re eating dinner we have to pick up everything off the kitchen counter before we sit down or that A A even if it s like in a to go box if it s sealed he ll knock it onto the ground to try to open it to get into it and Shane was like I m gon na start calling him Lucifer when he s bad and I was like why would you call him Lucifer and Shane was like oh that s the devil s name right and I didn t know that I knew his name is Satan I I m I didn t go to church growing up okay I mean neither did I like yeah but you have a devil dog so you re so like he taught me what Satan and Lucifer were well I don t know Satan and Lucifer were the same thing so so there s an interesting thing and I actually it s a it s a funny thing that you bring this up because on Friday I started really studying demons and demonology and there s an interesting thing it s for a script and you know that I don t act like I m doing something Shady you re dead if I am doing something Shady you re the first on the list what oh yeah I thought we were best friends we were until you started laughing like that at my dog fired Music um no so technically most demons are fallen angels right and I didn t know I guess I didn t know the story of Satan I didn t know that Satan was like the popular kid that was rebellious up in heaven and then it got the boot yeah yeah so and wow crazy yeah so why are you what did you learn about demonology oh just that that was interesting I ve also learned that you know um more often than not people are inserting like a blood sacrifice or like a human sacrifice for these things but I feel like that s mostly Hollywood because you can make a whole bunch of different offerings to these people and they do a plethora of different things sorry there s a car outside he s okay what do you mean like in today s day and age people are still making blood sacrifices for a while no I m saying that s not as common as people want you to think like you don t summon a demon by killing someone you can summon a demon by doing other things though hey bubs you just put hands on my boy just kidding it s okay come here it s good he s a good boy he s a good man you hit him though to be funny you were like this yeah what do you think is gon na happen when you poop a dog that I told you is gon na bite you maybe not to bite he s a rescue he doesn t know any better Honey s a rescue she s not biting everyone honey has said some pretty nasty things to me that she said she learned on the streets okay come on get on track here okay I m back okay we can t do another podcast where there s a dog barking the whole time it s probably because your dogs are coming home right now no they re not oh the guy s coming to do the roof no I m holding a snoot no one take two marker sorry turns out bubs is a threat to humanity he is not a threat to humanity seems like it he just he had to go take some business calls in the car so he s busy he s handling business he couldn t sit through the show that he has no business being on he has work to do he s starting calling people to try to figure out how to deal with me but who s not busy with that you know what I m saying anyway so I had another networking blender you re like such a like hopeless it s pathetic when it comes to trying to make your way through Hollywood I mean it s nothing if not networking and it s just like I A A hate it yeah like I have nightmares about networking I spiral for days afterwards I A A hate myself like it s awful it s really hard I have to sit there and be like yeah so I ve got nothing going for me but you have something going for you so like maybe we could be friends and you could get something going for me too like it is for you or I could just come to your parties what are you talking about you have a successful podcast you re a podcaster I m a podcaster do you think that s like part of your leverage into why these people do want to meet with you or yeah I don t think that is I don t think it is um but at this last one we were like it was going really well we were like vibing and like being girls and like having a good time at La pancream and I A A threw my water at her oh I accidentally threw my A A water at her like I just filled my cup and I was like being overly dramatic and I just went through my water at her and how did she respond she was very cool about it I ve also found that like if I m very cool about it it s okay has she hit you up since no wow yeah and this is after you beg to become a part of her book club I didn t beg for the book club but I did say I would really like to be a part of her hike is it not one of the same no they re different things it s not a hiking book club two separate clubs I just thought it was like the same girls on the hike did the same book club I m sure there s some crossover wow maybe I should try to make friends too a good luck man because it is A A hard it is hard to make friends out of them streets they re cold they re uninviting I think all we have each other and we barely have that anymore I know yeah you give me the silent treatment often no yes you do girl I mean he said he said respondent for minutes this A A will leave me on red for five days and then apologize it on air and then try to make of an excuse for it like it s okay too much how would I want your attention I literally will send you like individual text messages yeah and I m just like are you getting A A right now why can t you talk to me what s going on hello Lizzy what s going on but then when she sends me like three text messages in the row in a row and I m like doing something where my hands are full I m like also pretty funny I don t remember why but I sent him like five text messages in a row and then it s like that wasn t important but then something else happened and I needed his immediate response so I called him and after he had never responded to any of it and it s not even five minutes ago past the seven text messages he s been inundated with and it s sponsoring and while his phone s working I was texting another message to him that was gon na say like this phone Call s not about the text messages it s something else please pick up I need your guidance and I had just gotten into the groove of editing like if you re well I guess with any work like there s Ebbs and flows and like I feel like I had finally got into this flow where I was like really making progress like there s days that are blessed by God when I m editing and there s other days I ll work for three hours and accomplish nothing and I m banging my head against the wall like why can I not function as a human being so I m in this great flow and Lizzy s boom boom boom boom boom boom boom so I turned my phone over and then it starts ringing and I pick it up and I was like this better be important what the A A do you want from me she goes this isn t related to other text messages bye and I feel like it still had nothing to do with anything no I really needed your help I had to respond to that email about that thing I m trying to make it super exciting than it was well as I pretend I m busy I m over here like faking that I m going to meetings because I m trying to avoid contractors at this house things are you going to and where are you leaving the house are you just going to a zoom meeting in your office no like people like the gardener will be like oh I because it s been a while since I ve been here so he wants to like ask me some questions and stuff I m like oh sorry I have a meeting and I m like running out the house like going to yoga in my sweatpants hoping that they don t see me because then I d be in a workout class like clothes I mean that s not alive running out of the house I have an important meeting but it s just like because so many things are going on at this house there s a lot of people in and out right now and I m just sick of A A dealing with these people yeah it s a lot it s too much should we make crystal with this yeah they all respond like Bob s like no I reject no the problem is I feel like I have to be present or nothing gets accomplished I get that you know what I m saying yeah I do I do I get it it s kind of like us being dog parents it s like if we don t who will no one that s the thing like it s A A exhausting like I really was so excited to bring him to work with me today and I m just like I can t bring him to work but I know I m a bad dog you re a bad boy and I love him he s mommy s special boy but he s a bad boy so what are you talking about setting up an emergency contact oh we should set up emergency contacts on our phone like right now so if someone has an emergency near you and you can t get into the keypad like you can t get into their phone to see who to call you hit this emergency button and if you have an emergency contact set up there s a little um asterisk down in the bottom field here and it s you can click it and it ll open and you can put in your health insurance any pertinent information about your medical conditions if you have medical conditions if you re allergic to things that they could administer if there s an emergency and then you can also list your your points of contact and you can have multiple people to call if the first person doesn t answer but I was recently in a situation where um somebody I needed to I needed to open somebody s phone to contact a family member um I was around somebody who had had a seizure and it was a lot right and my fir so I m with and I was with a bunch of people so there s a lot of people tending to him and in an emergency situation my mind always goes to you don t want too many cooks in the kitchen right so I I can tell that he s being taken care of and there s nothing I can do I can see somebody s calling so I don t want to call and flood the system and what can I do I look around my environment oh I can clear a walkway in the entrance so that when the EMTs get here they have an easy way getting in and we re not wasting more time moving chairs and then I remember like oh I should call somebody in his family who can help him or at least so that they know where he is and what has happened because he s not alone in this world um and then at first I was just thinking like he was an older man so I was thinking I can he probably doesn t have a passcode because I m an Aegis A A and so I just went over to his phone and opened it and he had a passcode and I was like A A and then I was thinking I can hold it up to his face and that s crazy so I was standing there for like I know but I m really thinking about it because I know this is a weird choice and he s like having a seizure and there s EMTs around and I don t mean to be laughing no it s visual funny because it s crazy no that s why it s that s why it s hideous because that s literally where my brain was like but you got ta know that s an inappropriate thing to do and like the EMTs are putting him on a gurney like all the stuff is going on it s not an appropriate time to steal someone s face you know what I m saying right and then I see the emergency thing and I tapped it and there s an emergency contact option on it and he had it all set up so I was able to contact his family how crazy that you being ages turned around into you learning somebody something from the older gentleman who had something you had no idea existed yeah wow and then I waited with him while the EMTs because I guess they won t take you away from where you are until they know where they re taking you Hospital wise so I just waited for the MTS to know where just be the closest hospital or you re not always health insurance I mean not always it s I think it all just depends on where what s open and what s available okay so I just waited and then they told me and I was able to relay that to his family and so his family was waiting for him at the hospital when he got there wow but all of that s to say if you have your phone on you at all times you can put a lot of A A information in that emergency contact bill right and we should all have it and he is okay right he is okay I have seen him since he is okay yeah also warning signs for seizures I was unaware of and now that I know them I feel incredibly lucky and um they re not what you would expect did we not do this when Haley Bieber had one waited uh fainting and strokes oh okay so seizures the next s in the line oh my God Lizzy I m making light of the situation but it s it s an interesting thing that happens so because it s a neurological thing your neuro your brain goes a little haywire and there are learning signs there are not learning signs but there are like sort of like postmarks of oh you might be having a seizure soon if this is happening to you one of the feelings if you re the person who s gon na have the seizures you have you could have it s not required but you could have an overwhelming feeling of deja vu interesting yes that s kind of scary because now if I ever get deja vu I m gon na be freaking out I feel like you don t remember anything so there s no way in A A you would ever suffer from Deja Vu so if you do for a second feel like I remember this you re probably having a seizure wow okay so well you ll know okay Deja Vu yeah so Deja Vu is one of them an extreme sense of fear okay um and then in this particular situation I noticed that uh there was a huge uh there was a big laugh he he laughed really really hard and inappropriately and that and so that was an indication that something was wrong he started laughing inappropriately and really weird and then he got very uncontrollably yes like a compulsive because that s what s happening like your whole brain is just going boo really quickly and when that s happening I m not a A A doctor so Google this A A too like I m not right but I did this is this is what I saw I saw a big burst of inappropriate compulsive laughter and then I saw extreme Terror and then um his muscles flinched in an upward diagonal motion to one side and his whole body kind of careened and looked up and in that moment somebody else that I was with and recognized that it was a seizure and the first thing that you want to do is you want to get that person on the ground because the next thing that s going to happen is they re going to fall and all of their muscles are going to convulse and when you fall you can hit your head on something and then like yeah and that creates a bigger problem so if you re having a sense of deja vu if you are with a person and you notice a spontaneous inappropriate emotions of any kind and then if you see a muscle jerk or a head jerk or any kind of thing like that just try really hard to get that person on the ground really quickly and call and take note of the time because the first thing the EMTs are going to ask you is how long the seizure lasted okay that s what I got um I know I don t think we ve talked about it on our podcast but um on Shane s podcast for sure your dad as well Chris is he doing any better um and you know if you don t want to talk about I just don t want to ignore it especially since we re like talking in the realm of this so if you don t want to talk about it don t feel obligated but if you want to you re welcome too I appreciate it um I can talk about it he s doing better I mean there s better and worse days I I think like I ve never experienced someone dealing with a stroke before and I didn t really know what this process would be and so I I mean my mom kept hoping he s just gon na be better okay wait can you back us up um so the first thing that had happened a couple years ago was in a stroke correct correct first my dad had a heart attack uh okay roughly a couple of years ago flatlined uh but he made it and he was okay and and he lost uh eyesight in one eye but other than that he was pretty much fine he was doing everything as normal and he did his eyesight Sense come back uh no oh so he has won were the things related uh well that from the heart attack I guess when he flatlined uh when they did the what s it called the clear yeah um yeah that thing the defibrillator that I don t know yeah uh that thing I guess is so intense it causes people to like bite down and break teeth sometimes that s why they put something in your mouth when they do it often see I didn t know that but or maybe I m just thinking of electroshock therapy but I guess it like burst a capillary in his eye and that caused that to happen got it um but uh but otherwise totally fine he healed like completely fine and was doing everything as normal and he s a very physical guy who was like like re shingling roofs of houses and stuff you know and uh he was fine and then but I guess uh during that whole process at some point they saw that he had an aneurysm in his brain and that was something they had to address in the future he went to a hospital to address it it is an aneurysm like a blockage of blood I see I m not too sure I mean I was under the impr I mean I could be wrong we should Google it before we talk we speak to it but I thought the aneurysm was an actual event aneurysm I mean I think it was like uh some kind of it looked in a picture or a scan like some kind of bubble or something well she had gotten then some sort of preventative surgery correct yes for the aneurysm which is according to google a weakness and a blood vessel in the brain that balloons and fills with blood yeah uh and it can cause a stroke it s like a blood clot yes and so they did a a an elective uh surgery to prevent it from uh causing a stroke in the future uh called coiling and the thing that we did to prevent a stroke ended up causing a stroke a couple days later and it was really frustrating because so it was in response to the procedure yes and was that a potential going in did they warn of that they said it s a procedure that s done all the time and it s a percent of the time effective and like we were all like not really worried and then that happened unfortunately did the stroke happen in the hospital or back home no he was only in the hospital for a little over a day which felt very short to me but he went back home and then had the stroke but it just felt like a really bad headache he didn t even know it was a stroke and uh he actually my mom was worried good she we worry my mom and I worry a lot about everything too much but she was like we need to go to the hospital and he s like leave me alone it s just a headache I m gon na sleep it off not realizing it was a stroke and so he went to sleep having a stroke we found out much later on and then mom had gotten him to the hospital prior not yet that night he went to sleep and then the next day his headache was much worse and I guess that was already a baby stroke the first one but then his headache was much worse and he really wasn t feeling well and my mom was like all right we re going to the hospital I m not waiting anymore and she made him go to the hospital which I m like I ve worn for my mom I don t know what would have happened because he wouldn t have gone to the hospital so I m very glad they were together but she made him go and then at this hospital they they like were just taking their sweet time and I kept checking in and it had been like eight hours at one point they were like they re still figuring out what to do and I m like why is this taking so long like you just had a brain surgery and it s maybe having a stroke like what what and so many hours went by and then at some point when he was in the hospital my mom had to go get paperwork because after waiting for hours they were like oh his insurance isn t covered here and this and then my mama to go get his paperwork and when she came back he had had a second stroke in the period when she left and by the time she came back his entire left side of his body was paralyzed reloading face arm leg and is he still I know now he s been there for a week or two now he s been at a few different hospitals but this whole ordeal has been like two weeks or something like that uh and he s currently at a hospital slash Physical Therapy Center um and he s working on physical therapy but it s it s really tough there are days when it feels I feel very hopeful and he feels very hopeful and it seems like things are going the right direction and then there are days that just feel kind of hopeless and me and my mom like had a whole talk the other day where we realized like this is going to be a long thing that we have this is like our life is just different now and we just have to get used to that and it s really tough but it s a marathon not a Sprint I do have friends who have recovered from big bad Strokes complete loss of the operation on an entire side of their body can t speak have to remember have to relearn language and they did and from what that s nice from everything that older heard of Chris s dad is he s a very strong willed yeah hard to do like oh yeah very determined person so if anyone can do it hopefully it will be him and we re thinking of you and praying for you obviously and hopefully everyone else will send their love as well I m also gon na google just what you re supposed to do if you see a stroke happening because I was working for someone whose father had a stroke and I think you re supposed to give them something if you can get them to take something really quickly and it helps because it s like a blood thinner or something oh they re kind of like a heart attack um because with that too there was like uh some some kind of like aspirin or something yeah something like that so scary when you start going down everything that could possibly go wrong because our bodies are so complicated it s like I understand because that is honestly what sent you into a two year kind of medical spiral as well when your dad first had his heart attack you kept thinking that you were having I mean I don t you weren t thinking you were having all of the symptoms but it s probably some in some of it was in relation to just like the immense amount of fear yes yeah I was in and out for a long time convinced I was having a heart attacks I was positive I was having heart attacks and uh every time they d be like no you re just stressed and I m like no and the thing that made me even more like frustrated and scared of the whole situation is my dad a week prior to his heart attack went in with like feeling the same kind of things I was feeling and they were like it s just anxiety to go home and then he flatlined a week later or not even a few days later he flatlined so they were wrong about him completely so every time I go in with these symptoms now and they re like oh it s just anxiety I m like you re wrong because you were wrong about my dad and then it s hard to like go home feeling any better yes there s a there s this thing a lot of people well like a lot of celebrities are doing now because it is expensive it s like called a pre nuvo scan where you go in and they scan your entire body and check for like plus potential problem areas in all of your body and so I like I don t know it s the thing I feel like I I want to like go do because it s like you can get a physical every year but it s very like visual they kind of just look at you feel around and you don t really know what s going on in the inner did you find something uh aspirin really yeah okay and then there s a bunch of you know telltale signs but you know it s it s having that intuition to know that something is wrong instead of right you know what I mean like it and to whatever degree of for everybody but I also think that a big thing is like advocating for yourself in the face of medical professionals who are overworked and tired and sure it looks like this thing but I m telling you with my heart of hearts I know that it is something else yeah with my dad and he in the first hospital he was in there was a gentleman next to him who also had had a stroke and they both had the worst headaches they ve ever had in their lives was a was a common thing for both of them the the other guy next to him said he felt like he was like if I got hit in the head with two hammers at the same time it wouldn t have been as bad like it was the worst headache I ve ever had so that was a common thing it seemed but yeah but your dad is talking he s talking yeah I mean it s not the same and it s tougher on some days but he is and he s still mentally there and aware awesome which I m super grateful for yeah so you know wow yeah all right well everyone think of Chris s dad have him in your thoughts your prayers whatever you believe in um and we re hoping that he has a full recovery thank you and set up the emergency contact on your phone yeah I actually did it right now really yeah because I can t figure it out all right well let s jump into some ridiculous news let s have let s turn the this podcast into something silly silly or enraging well I don t know the first thing you have over here is Kylie s baby name is revealed Kylie s baby s name is revealed unfortun like I did not know you informed me yeah well I had just which is on Instagram right when it happened yeah I don t I don t really care like I know I just like I I don t know like the baby is one thing like I m like oh my gosh Kylie had another baby congratulations she s so cute but like the name it s like it s a year later it s like I don t really care and it s like is it better than wolf no exactly no it s not it s air with an e at the end or a y Airy it s air Oh that s oh I didn t see interesting yeah I thought it was like that store Arie or Ari yeah it s a different one it s air okay so and the Bummer is that apparently in uh the way that they re spelling it it becomes a a slang word in Arabic for penis oh my God and I m wondering if they knew is this yeah no this was in the news news okay because I did I feel like in her announcement post she probably should have also done a video where she s saying the name because I did see a headline that was like how you actually pronounce Kylie s baby s name and I was like I m not gon na click on an article to do that I already read it it s re idiots I mean it s not spelled no I read it as re because it s also like what are we what kind of games and so it s stormy and air yeah wow so weather so weather serving weather um okay yeah I just thought that was funny yeah I saw it and I texted Lizzy I said oh my gosh are you okay because you do freak out um okay and then Kim takes a dig at her sisters oh so there was this whole thing on Instagram where the girls were like at each other s throats like actually no no I wish I wish it was that dramatic it s not like when Courtney slapped the A A out of Kim which I loved I just feel like uh family relationships can be very um tumultuous tumultuous and it s very impressive quite honestly how many sisters there are that are famous that aren t actually like beating the A A out of each other yeah so I just wonder how much is actually going on behind the scenes that they don t share on camera I ve gone I ve seen I ve heard people say that there s a sister that nobody talks to and it s like obviously Courtney Laughter like I love Courtney on an island for Courtney like are the girls not texting when they re not forced to film with each other on the Kardashians yeah they are there s a family chat and that s what spur that s like a continuous well that s yeah okay yeah because Kim posted about it I m just saying Kim was like when your sisters call on the group chat I m just saying it s incredible that they maintain such closeness with the amount of Fame that they all have and I m sure there s jealousy running rampant behind closed doors even if I honestly civilize I wouldn t be shocked if there wasn t legitimate elements jealousy I do feel like they are all proud of each other and I do think they hate Courtney I just think it well like what I m saying my my opinion is validated in having watched some of these episodes where Kim s like I quite literally years ago would have killed Kendall to get on the cover of vote right and so but they re all tired now you know they re in their s they ve been working every day for A A years fake drama that s so well before we move on from that did you see the Vogue true like um lie detector test with Courtney and Chloe no they did a lie detector test and Courtney was like are you ever gon na let truce spend the night at my house and Courtney was all right Chloe was like no I will never let my daughter send that out of your house what why they didn t talk they didn t get into that but I think it s probably because Courtney has like a an open a free range approach to her parenting quite frankly and I know I said last week that I m it doesn t let them meet me like her no like she lets them do whatever the A A they want except for eat meat right but other than that she lets them do whatever the A A they want oh okay like there s no okay uh on on the Kardashians we watched Kim say you made my nanny cry because you in front of your child demeaned her because your kid asked you to and she goes yeah if rain wants me to demean someone in front of him I do it and it s like well that s nuts I mean we weren t living the situation I m sure there s layers I mean that s nuts okay all right get into this so the new drama between Kylie the youngest and Kim the second eldest important details important okay okay um so Kylie posted a picture on her Instagram in a field wearing like a one piece with like a tank top over it and it s all skims apparently and so Kim commented in the section like no tag for skins see this is what I m talking about yeah and then Kylie shaded it to some degree and then posted another picture on Instagram just said that said don t be A A rude oh so there is I see and then Kim posted a tick tock where she s like when the sisters call on a group chat or like something I m over I m over doing Facebook and see what I mean is even though this is like jokey jokes online yeah it s probably rooted in some amount of truth I mean I m sure Kim was livid that Kylie who has the influence that she has posted a full skims look and wasn t like tagging skins of course yeah and so that s what I m saying is like Kylie also does probably really grind their gears behind closed doors I bet Kim was fuming for three hours walking around her Mansion why would she do that like what a A A A A but I do also think that uh Kylie doesn t really do promos like that yeah I don t think Kylie or Kindle do anything they don t want to do even when Kylie had like that event in Vegas or one of the sisters had something in Vegas oh it was Kindle for and Kylie the day of was like I like it yeah so Haley Bieber stepped in I was thinking about how do you see the Haley Bieber copied my haircut I went out and try pop my A A hair off and then Haley Bieber was like oh I like what Lizzie Gordon did I think I m gon na do the same and I m just like this was an accident Haley but your shirt looks good because it s a little bit stringier and thinner than Mine mine s coming out a little weird but yours is good I was driving down the street the other day just thinking about the Beavers yeah because Justin song came on and I was like God damn Haley s gon na be the cutest pregnant woman in the world I know and Justin s just like like I hate them I love that I mean I love them so much I love Justin thank you so much like he pains me to think how like perfect they are yeah keep going no that s it he got all A A up at a kid Leroy concert where he was supposed to perform their song together and he s like leaning on the balcony and still like has the voice of an Angel while holding a drink he s like Music he just can t hold himself up it s everything I A A love them I also saw Kendall and Justin Bieber like in public and Kendall s clearly gossiping with him you saw them or no on the internet oh my gosh this is so falling flat for me but the way you just responded Kendall s saying something to Justin and he responds like that he s like no no so it s like I want to know what Kendall was saying but I also love that Justin s like delivering in the gossip like he s one of the girls even though he s probably had sex with all the girls which is hard for Haley I m sure because it d be hard for me we ll touch on that later Laughter um you have a couple minutes to apologize to Northwest oh I also would like to retract my statements about Northwest I was right when I said we shouldn t talk about kids no no I don t think that s not why I m sorry I m not sorry because honestly I am still scared shitless a A A Courtney s kids rain

take three marker um before we move on I want to address something that I ve seen in the comment section recently what yeah okay someone was like Lizzy needs to cool it on the Botox and filler she s starting to be like unexpressive and like I have called it I like literally haven t gotten Botox and filler in almost a year and I ve got a lot of Mobility A A just wanted to say haven t clarified I just wanted to A A say I think Botox looks like fine now but if you keep going or you re gon na look like a real housewives of Beverly Hills no and I would never go that far how do you know because I don t want to I think it s because I m just choosing to not be expressive but I was in the car the other day and I was like there s all the lines like you could write a A A essay on this forehead right now A A you can suck my ass you know what you re saying wow oh my gosh well and if the comments aren t a safe place for me to dwell then I can t interact with the rest of the podium so no I do scroll for a little while and then I start seeing nasty ones and I was like and that s my cue to leave this can I see like one that s really nasty I m like oh I don t need this anymore yeah no I can t do it and it s not even just like me not taking constructive criticism it s just like if it s really natural it s just mean it s not healthy for my mindset to keep on scrolling and like why would I like why and also why would you I do like to especially on the podcast just like interact I love interacting all I want to do is interact with these A A until they re mean to you well I m not interacting with anyone as an A A but I have considered like commenting on them and being like A A you could you imagine because that s what that s the energy they re coming at us with do you know what I m saying yeah some of them really are like that Ryland you did a good oh this was another comment Rylan you ve done such a good job breaking Lizzy s spirit and taming her because she was unfucking bearable for years until you and it s just like hey guys I was like hey guess what dude A A you honestly I almost screen grabbed it and sent it to you with me responding A A you and then I was like this A A doesn t deserve my time but now you re getting it because guess what A A you A A A A you and with that I will say of the podcast comments really nice I m so like honestly like a nasty few but they really like to like say paragraphs what the A A A A you re never gon na see me in real life and if you do walk the other way A A are you high what was your Starbucks order today it s the same every day what is it it s a matcha soy latte kids temp so I can check it if I m on the go you know what I m saying okay well we thought a fun segment would be reacting to all of the tick tocks Lizzy sent me that I didn t open because there s nothing that makes my blood boil more than getting a link to a tick tock video and honestly I will say this I only send you things that I think are funny and then this week because we were going to do the segment it s like I m grasping at straws a little bit well I told you to scroll up to previously I know but I can t remember what you ve seen what you haven t seen it was like too much and then also it was like you just didn t want to scroll up on our text messages no I love scrolling up on our text messages I do it all the time when you don t respond to me I m like what were we talking about the last time we talked so what do you want to do it you want to look at them yeah of course I want to look at them so I haven t watched these yet uh Lizzy uh downloaded them and airdropped them to me just now I won t lie I ve seen the Jennifer Coolidge one because she posted it on her own Instagram oh well and can I tell you a secret you like Tick Tock now again because this is the on again off again romance no I did have a tick tock Revelation though you know how I m always doomsday with Tick Tock I think it s the worst thing that s happened to humanity Revelations like sitting across me right now how often is this the monologue there s a small part of me that has come to love an element of tick tock which one s Chris three yeah say it on a few there s been a few how many times has he had a revolution you come and go weekly no and well I don t think I ve ever loved Tick Tock no I mean like play back the tape right because no no no you back me up on this oh I mean it s been a few times I liked Tick Tock before yeah all the A A time this happens all the A A time don t be scared tell them how he is um Okay the reason I like Tick Tock is because when I m editing Vlogs it s really really really really easy to download a tick tock right you just hit download and there it is on your phone whereas on YouTube you have to like copy the link and then you have to go see what a legal site is still afloat today and download because it isn t like you can just screen grab it on a YouTube video on your phone I don t like doing that okay I I for some reason the quality is different and you have to crop it a million times and it s like I I well you should scale it you don t need to crop it I did realize on my phone when I was scrolling on YouTube the other day there was an option to download yeah on YouTube but you had to pay for premium and I m such a cheap A A my job s on YouTube and I still don t pay for people honestly I never would either and I won t pay for Spotify it s like a month or a month it s a lot of money but if I can download any video then it s like a business expense right and it s worth it to me yeah and then I won t have to watch ads either but a toxic part of me also likes to know what ads are playing on my videos and I like when you watch my videos and you tell me what ads I m playing on mine and like that s a good one I m like look at me I go to jail guess what my ads and he s like what does that mean I don t know not because I really know like Rylan said it was cool that s a conversation I m just like what does that mean I m like I don t know but Rylan pointed it out so I m assuming it means I m good have you been comparing your analytics like month by month I I mean I look at the revenue okay but I don t notice okay I don t know any of it I still don t understand when you guys were talking about the ranks that I like was looking at mine I was like I don t get it it hit you in the face the first time you right when you open your YouTube app it s like no I know but I don t understand out of and you re like that sounds good to me out of that means it s the worst performing video out of your top ten but who cares that means you have a flop yeah but like what I ve also noticed is sometimes I ll make a video and I m like this one s really good and it ll flop so I don t care do you know what I mean I know to me the quality of the content is fine the only do you know what I m saying like and that s confidence that s uncomfortable well no I mean like and sometimes I ll post when I m like this is a real piece of A A and it does really well and I ll be like well I guess it doesn t A A matter I understand that sentiment like when I put a ton of money into my Christmas music video so many days of prepping so many production people uh it like had flopped in comparison to everything else I was posting at the time I m so sorry I think I have a wart oh my God I think I have a little work is that a wart okay let me inspect it a little bit is that a word yeah you got ta go freeze that A A are you kidding me you got ta go freeze it and you can not hold my hand wait I touched it with this hand oh my God don t touch anything else do you have work stuff from when you add words no am I gon na get warts on this hand too how quickly do warts transfer do we have to stop the show I don t know do you have work A A I don t think so what the A A is this I don t have any warts is this a wart yes that s a wart for sure for real a little clear bubbly thing on your finger yeah it will burn off quickly you need to Google what the A A I do right now it s the uh it s the planter warts on your feet that will last for like a year should I go to the should I stop by the vet on the way home and have them gnaw this A A off okay so back to our tick tock song I m blocked out with anxiety with more this Jennifer Coolidge one I ve got to say I m her number one fan and I was so bored seconds into this Tick Tock that I left do you know the origin story it wasn t until I saw four other headlines being like so epic that I went back and watched the whole thing and saw Jennifer Lopez at the end to install this oh you didn t know that was Jenny s song No I knew it was Jenny s song but I was like why do I need to watch somebody say it really slowly no one s ever called her job it was like I m still I m still like it was too slow for her I know I didn t have the patience hi this is my first Tick Tock and I was trying to think of something cool to do and I think um I think I m just going to do a poem it s like too slow right my attention span is and you don t get Jennifer Coolidge and you can A A off when it s in when it s acted in a scene I get it but when it s like yeah if I did my podcast like hey I thought I would do you re not you re not interesting enough to do that I wasn t interested enough in this either and I m her number one fan no but you re also not our number one fan I ever number one obviously or not but that was why I said be fooled by the rocks that I got it s just all for me next next Jennifer Lopez always be looking fabulous though okay this is the next one I thought that was a limit drop I didn t think it was tequila that reminded me of you because you like lemon drops and tequila I m having impulse control issues and all I want to do is rub my wart all over your A A face if I m not doing it but I want to well I liked that one yeah I love a little high waisted jeans and I love like a nice like tight shirt I love the high boots I think they re very sexy little Matrix jacket I love it I love it but that s not Brooklyn Beckham it is Brooklyn Beckham wait that is yeah now he s trying to be a stylist look at what he s wearing that s him that s him foreign we went for a hike and she s like is it weird if I wear my hiking boots like that s like that s like a loser move right and I was like no like the more of a loser you look the more likely it is that you re famous out here um but yeah I I love that he is trying to be a stylist now and the only adjective he has for this look that he s put together he s like oh love I love and I love this and I I love it okay I wouldn t have sent this to me if I were you but because we were talking about Brooklyn Beckham I know I know what you were doing and did you see his book of Photography yeah that did you read the captions no you should read the captions on this book of Photography it s like this is my buddy you don t understand the difference between first class business class and economy it s not your fault it s cause you re Paul s don t know the difference Music I I love that guys Tick Tock he s always doing that because there s a part of tick tock where people show off their ice and they have like wild eyes like they have coffee ice they have chocolate milk should I show my ice do you have rich people eyes I have coffee be nice wow you don t know that no I guess it s because so should I do that Tick Tock I like when Tick Tock was first so one thing people wouldn t know about my house that s kind of shocking no there s just literally a side of tick tock where people just show their fancy eyes so you don t even have to do more on top will you teach me how to do that after you just show your eyes you just literally have no sound or something you just open it up and you just show us your ice okay I ll do that today okay do you think that will go like after I haven t been on Tick Tock for four months I honestly like I literally am your girlfriend who s like I can t keep talking about this guy it s like it s like tana and Chris Miles okay I m doing real I ll do it real does that make you happy I don t I don t care is what I m saying like you ve exhausted me as a friend I mean what if I don t want to live the way you live oh don t be ridiculous Andrea everybody wants this that s dog ownership humor for you there s a woman who s just like beautiful at her house is clean and she s happy and she s like but what if I don t want to live the way you do and then it s a shit s creek reference oh oh my God that s not shit s creek no it s Devil Wears Prada at the end of the movie where Meryl Streep is looking at Andy and she s like Miserable as ever her husband s divorcing her everyone everything in her personal life is A A and she s like don t be ridiculous Andrea everyone wants to be this wow I love that you taught me something today and Hathaway fan for sure no I m an openly hates Anna Hathaway kind of girl you know I hate her you re crazy I m not she s a A A oh I m just kidding oh I m just kidding and that s it that s it two out of five were great no three out of five the airplane one was good too well that was fun should we get into some advice though yes we should it s been a minute so this first one that I pulled it s more it s like half Story Time half like she wants our advice but I think it could be fun to launch into our own mishaps okie dokie one time I was making out with a guy we were keeping it very PG clothes were on and we were dry humping after about minutes of making out he says I m finishing and this guy proceeds to finish in Period his period pants period I acted normal but uh I acted normal about it as to not embarrass him because I know that happens to some guys but then he proceeded to do nothing about it he didn t get up to go to the bathroom to pee or change nothing and he even slept over at my house after and slept in his jizz filled pants that situation ship ended shortly thereafter so I never asked him about it I just want to know if this is normal or has happened to anyone else wow you know what I m sure it s uh as a person who s regularly doing embarrassing things sometimes your brain is like oh I I can t think about how to remedy this and then it s like every possible thing you could do to help yourself in that scenario starts firing off but it s too many responses and it renders you useless and you just act not at all I just think it s funny that he owned up to it like he had the nerve to say I m gon na finish but right then just sat there no with like splooge in his pants because there s no feeling that s more uncomfortable than I mean I honestly think he probably was in a state of anxious shock and could not act because of the panic right because it s like a deer and headlights response to mortification it s also embarrassing to like finish early on a first day or like when you re still getting to know somebody because that is like a bummer like when yeah when you re like I guess well yeah if you re sleeping with people before you were a married girl were there any people that like just came immediately and you re like well this is for A A nothing I mean I none of that s coming to mind but I am just thinking about like the first time I ripped ass audibly in front of Joe and I was just so A A mortified that I I I was like I was I was stunned silent like the girl what is it the girl couldn t speak what is the saying Mr Devil Wears Prada I don t know whatever should the girl was too stunned to speak has this ever happened to you Chris or like and Chris is like my pants are full of just right now what was that yeah he s just been twisting it and she s I don t know where someone just too early or like in their pants or like well because I would dry hump with people before we would like get to the point of having sex I can t imagine I I bet I ve come in my pants before but I would definitely go clean it you got ta change yeah yeah I don t think I ve ever in my pants and I don t think I ve ever had anyone do that in their pants either actually I don t think that s the only time I ve ever in my pants is like when I had a wet dream alone you know what I mean but that s different that is the equivalent though because then you re sitting there when your A A sheets a mess and it s like well now what do I keep sleeping or do I wake up and fix the situation and ruin my entire sleep for the night but I have had uh are you saying you ll have a wet dream and decide to sleep in it yeah okay oh I can t I d like well no it s like a lot I ll get like a towel and really like wipe it off to nothing and then yeah I ll deal with it once I m up in the morning I feel like in your boxers that are like tight to your body though I wouldn t be able to deal with that if I was this man I would have walked to the bathroom yeah that s taking off my underwear yeah cleaned up a little bit and just free free balled it yeah I did for the record though I have an X finish like immediately like in a pump and I was like wow see and I almost feel like a hot tip to all you guys out there just do it like get off before you have sex and then ramp yourself back up because it s not gon na do anybody a favor if you re going to finish in one pump and and here I m gon na go back to like what I was saying when I threw the water at that A A I think the moral of the story is if you do something embarrassing own it because if you own it it s less embarrassing oh it can also be a funny memorable moment meant that like ha if you marry this person you ll remember that forever if you made a moment out of it I used to pee my pants all the time because I would laugh really hard and just lose control and piss myself and it s embarrassing if you try to hide it right so you re like an adult who s wearing piss pants and someone s like did you miss your pants like if someone has to ask you if you pissed your pants it s bad but if you re like a problem with you yeah and then we re all laughing like she s sick she s a sick A A and it s like I m sick I m a sick A A but you like own it do you know what I mean and I have a hot take on people finishing early well I think it s flattering because it s like deers they re so attracted to you they couldn t contain themselves I don t know I think it s annoying I know I get that element of it too yeah um and then my balls are blue and I m living a recurring problem though but I thought I feel if like you were to do that I feel like that person is also able to like turn it around quick and be ready to go again right so that s my hot tip to all of you boys out there if you feel like you re gon na like come real quick yeah do it via a hand and then get ramped up again in three minutes and please your woman or your man yeah and if you embarrassingly just piss or A A your pants call it just tell everybody just A A tell everyone they know anyway can you imagine they know anyway and they re making the situation less bad by saying A A my pants what if this girl was out of his League he was so turned on by her it s his dream girl he s already like embarrassed he can not believe that he got to a point where he s dry humping with this girl and it s like boom and he s like this is going to ruin everything for me well she knows Honestly though he probably couldn t recover from it and then it was so awkward that he was dying awkward yeah and that s what I m saying that s why I m saying you got a A A pop the A A balloon and just be like I just did these pants yep you know he can still take care of her in other ways yeah absolutely but he can t if he s like Paralyzed by the anxiety of the choice to like do nothing there I I know I ve talked about this before but there was a guy in one of my classes in college who A A his pants and he didn t say anything and he was trapped in the room afterwards because I was being an A A talking to everyone at the door where he was trying to get out but he couldn t get out and then it s like he was fighting his time he s not part of the conversation he s just panicking did it not stink it I I didn t notice the stink and then he so he s panicking he s biting his time he s waiting he s like these A A are never gon na shut up I need to run out the door right now but he picked the right the time right before we all turned to walk out so then he s at the front of the pack and we can all see the A A in the back of his khakis and my girl grabs my arm she goes you should his pants and then I go what the A A and I go oh my God he A A his pants I would have ran and then there s like more people I m like dude he A A his pants were all behind him he A A his pants he never came back to class would you well here s the deal had I been in the situation I probably would have fainted from the anxiety because I have a medical condition but the other thing I want to say is if he was just like guys I don t know if it s an appropriate to raise your hand in the middle of a A A class and see like I haven t announced no like I mean like what else you re gon na do like guys if I was him I would have just ran out the room when it happened there s no scenario that could stop me from bolting like I don t care if you re blocking the door I d be like got a crazy like the best phone call of my life got ta go and I just A A dead yeah I mean I got that approach but we re still all gon na see the A A in your pants did you have any weird uh sexual uh encounters when you were like young I mean I m sure I did but I was also a raging alcoholic and nothing is coming to mind except for that boy shooting his pants in my class yeah I did I already tell the story about when I walked out on somebody in the shower no I don t think so wow wait what do you mean this is quite a time for me oh maybe you did maybe you ve just told me it though I was like recurringly hooking up with this guy and he was older than me and like I didn t really like him but the sex was good but I don t smoke pot often and so we got really stoned together and then he wanted to go have sex in the shower but I was sitting in the shower and were naked and in that moment when I was so stoned I was like I hate this guy like I hate this guy and so I looked up and I was just like I got ta go and so I m dying up got it down and just like walked out of his house but I was so stoned out of my mind I couldn t drive so I just had to sit there like in his neighborhood in my car like stunned out of my mind being like wow and that s why I don t smoke pot because I ll realize that like things that I do are so cringy or I ll have like Revelations and you just got that you ve got the ick and you got ta go I get that no I really got that yeah the first time I got high with Joe I was like what is this voice what is his voice oh and I couldn t stop thinking about his voice it was crazy still loved him though she was so hot all right do we have time for one more or should we leave what s what time is that we have six minutes let s do it what do you think yeah I m all right this one yeah wow this is A A up I m currently in a four year relationship and we re engaged a few months ago my fiance tells me he loves me but he is no longer in love with me I definitely noticed he wasn t being as affectionate with me lately prior to him confessing this to me we talked and I explained to him that love is a choice not a feeling hmm I told him he wasn t choosing to put effort into staying in love with me and that s why he felt that way he agreed and said he would try more although I sort of saw this coming it really broke my heart to find out and I m feeling a bit on edge now at first I thought he was breaking up with me but he says he can t imagine his life without me and wants a future with me I would love advice on how to move the relationship forward and how to keep a long term relationship fresh and fun also is it normal to fall in and out of love during a relationship or is this a bad sign I think all relationships have Ebbs and flows I don t think you should stay in a relationship with somebody you think you ve fallen out of love with because like if say I m with Shane for seven years there s even if I like say I fell out of love with him I think there would still always be love there because I wouldn t have been with him for seven years had I not loved him loved our time together um but I do think like if it s not temporary like how if you go back and ask your fiance like well how long have you not been in love with me because I think you can go like through a flow of like a month where you re like annoyed by a person or you re not having romantic encounters or a lot of things are going wrong that s taking away from you guys being able to like Focus or put time and attention into your relationship but if this has been a year that he feels like he s been out of love with you I don t think you should stay with somebody just because you ve always been with them I agree with what you re saying and I also feel like exactly you feel like there s Ebbs and flows and things but it s like and you know more than I I complain a lot right and I but and I m always in love with Joe yeah because if I wasn t in love with Joe I wouldn t stick through the complaints do you know what I m saying yeah and I always think like oh that s A A annoying because he s hot you know what I mean like God damn it I hate you but you re so hot and I but I do feel like because I love you mm hmm and I m not in love with you right that s a platonic love yeah and so if you re gon na marry someone I mean honestly and I vacillate on this and this is a new thing for me but I do think about this all the time because I do think you can be married to someone love them and not be in love with them and have a successful marriage I think so too I do think probably a lot of relationships hit a point maybe years in where they re like well maybe we re not Head Over Heels like in love Yeah but this is what s always been we have we live together very well maybe you have kids that have grown up and are out of the house and there s just not a you re not willing to explore what else is out there so I guess maybe it s something you also have to ask yourself I m saying like later in life but maybe later this is right now like maybe I would pump the brakes on the on getting married I definitely would pump the brakes on getting married and really consider what your feelings are in this situation because I don t know if you want your full time job becoming convincing someone to be in love with you because that s not something you can control and it would drive me it would drive me absolutely crazy and it may hurt and you do lose comfort and and patterns and somebody that you love because I m not denying that you guys love each other but loving somebody and being in love with somebody are different things this were me and Shane had said this to me I would say how long have you been feeling this way and I would I d really want to get to the root of what it was I was like do you think we re just in like an ebb and then I would put a lot of attention into like refocusing prioritizing date nights yeah and rediscovering why we love each other yeah and if that didn t work for me at years old I don t think I would stick it through with somebody that isn t in love with me because I still have such a big life ahead of me I don t think I d be willing to be like well just because we re comfortable and we re in this house with these animals I don t want to disrupt that I d be like no I want to choose adventure and life and love with somebody that wants to meet me where I m at um so can you accept your boyfriend or fiance and meet him where he s at or do you want to be head over heels in love with somebody I also think that there s a way to um find out if he s really not in love with you explore what those words mean to him because it might not be that he s not in love with you it might be that something else is happening in your relationship that s hurting him and I m only using the word hurt because I don t have a better adjective but there might be something else going on within the relationship and the only way he knows how to express it is with those words but he might not mean those words right because yeah so really get to the bottom of what that yeah really get to the bottom of the uh root of that thing and if you get to the root of it and it really is what he s saying it is then I would reevaluate everything but if it s not then it s something that you can amend well she did also say it was affecting how affectionate he was with her yeah so I agree with you in terms of like you need to discover what this means for both of you because like Shane and I could be fighting about one thing but what he s bringing to the table is like completely different yeah and we just have to get on the same page about like what he s saying and what that actually means to me versus what I m saying and what that actually means to me and that s and that s my that s my point because you know it s at a certain like there was a point where Joe was working a lot and not spending a lot of time with me and not giving me a lot of affection and attention and it made me feel like he doesn t love me right and when he when I feel like he doesn t love me I m like oh am I questioning this and then I like my articulation of it is I m questioning this so all he s hearing is oh you re questioning the validity of your love for me right but what I what s really happening is I m not expressing I feel like you re not available to me in a loving capacity so I m scared and that scares me so if you re able to have that open communication it s a lot more clear instead of somebody who s thinking on their own trying to boil it down to something and then in a state of being hurt and scared and insecure articulates this thing that comes out wrong yeah so definitely have a safe space conversation identifying where you both are in life because I ve been there with Shane as well where he s in like a two year like I m working non stop and I really have to like have a conversation being like hey like we need to prioritize each other in this as well but I think everyone has Ebbs and flows in life and whether that s work or whether that s uh problems in like your family or health or whatever like you re not always going to be head over heels for each other but just identifying where you both can live happily with each other yeah and I think you know love is different love isn t always expressed with lust or you know gifts or attention loving acts can be as simple as I know my wife likes it when I make the bed so I m going to make the bed even though I make it like a A A idiot and and it s things like that like I was telling you last night Joe made me pasta in bed and he came back in halfway through my meal and he was like would you like me to freshen up your cheese and I m like wow this A A loves me it s little it s it s things like that so I think as long as both of your hearts are burning and yearning to do loving acts for each other you are in love that s how I feel about it also we have a date night we do a date night and I also um um I I am working really hard to understand his love language right because I can be a selfish person who s like well if you re not loving me I m not loving you but it s like um yeah you got that to me right no so I like understanding his love language and expressing my love for him in that language is also a loving act that I can do and people come from different backgrounds yeah and people argue and discuss differently you just have to really figure out how to communicate with your partner effectively yeah yeah because for me I m like I m words and presents and Joe is not words and presents Joe is something else so I got ta figure out what that is and I got ta deliver on it all right well I hope we helped you at least a little bit it was fun to kind of explore I mean I m not not at your expense but just relationships in general it is fascinating to choose a partner and spend your life with them like it s a crazy concept it is and you better A A like that person because life is long and it s hard I was talking to someone recently sorry to tangent again but I was talking to someone recently and they re like it just it feels like it s one thing after the other and it s like that is life life is always one thing after the other once you pay your taxes this year it s A A months till you got ta pay him again like it does you know between that other things yeah so it s no matter what money is never going to be a determining factor of your joy you know Health Wellness whatever would be great but we don t always have it it is always going to be one thing or after the other so you got ta have a partner that you can face these things with and still have a moment of tenderness and laughter and support like that s what it is it s like you want a partner that you can just spend the rest of your life cleaning A A off the doors with I don t know why I m thinking about A A on doors it s not like my life is full of that but I do have to say icky A A pissed on my front seat and then he pissed in my bed last night after I put fresh A A sheets on the bed and I told you yesterday I was doing chores all day it took me hours to clean the A A house and that little A A gets right in my A A bed and pisses at the head of it he just pissed at that there s nothing worse than that that s crazy like choose the A A floor icky it s crazy and it s like my place already reeks like this because he s pissed all over the floor like why did he have to do it in the bed okay I m gon na let you deal with this on your own time uh thank you guys so much for watching and supporting our show we ll see you next week we love you very much goodbye and that s the Sip Music thank you Music
Music so Music scene one take one marker i just think it s ironic that today is the first day i actually thought to look and see what kind of propaganda chris is pushing on the slate does anyone read this i do chris normally gives heartfelt messages on the slate you know yeah hello everybody welcome back to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams joined by elizabeth home okay and my skin fungus which is returned what do you mean you see this little pink spot right here no oh oh you see it yeah i m pretty sure that s my skin fungus so you re just distracting with a bunch of bling that was the plan it s so itchy though that i can t not like think about it it kind of just looks like a mosquito bite or a spider bite to me yeah definitely a skin fungus how do you differentiate um it looks like my skin fungus like remember when i had that thing on my that patch on my leg i was like what is that i know but what is it did you ever go to work yeah that s how does that mean it means i m a gross A A A A it shouldn t be loved by anyone changes is it infectious it s not contagious which is confusing sometimes i feel like i have ringworm yeah but i m looking good and clear right now i don t think i ve ever had ringworm but i definitely had a skin fungus and might still present tense have a skin fungus i think you should get it checked i put the cream on it okay because it s happened before and i put the cream on it and it like went away don t touch it and then touch me right i don t want no i like asked my dermatologist because my friend kate was gon na come stay with me when i was diagnosed with it the first time she s like well make sure it s okay for me to be in your bed with you oh and you re so i like went back i was like standing in the lobby of a beautiful med spa full of beautiful women and i was there because of my skin fungus and my friend kate was like ask them if you could share a bed with me so i m like in a row of like A A like with some of them like i m here for my cool sculpt like saying all this like hot girl A A that they re doing and i was like so my friend wants to know if she could get my skin fungus if we share a bed what is the voice that s my hot girl voice okay and then also because i haven t had like a physical prescription in a long time like i haven t picked up prescription pills like in forever um i didn t realize it s all electronic now so when they gave me the skin ointment prescription or whatever i was i like left and then i was like oh A A i realized i don t have the like the script in my hand so i had to go back and i was like hi i um didn t get my prescription for my skin fungus ointment and they re like we don t do that it s like it s electronic like it gets wired to your A A pharmacy you sick A A please stop talking about your skin fungus in this lobby it s bad for business be gone and then they sprayed me with a little spray bottle okay well i did something crazy yeah and i was very nervous you were nervous oh my gosh of course i was nervous and i was most nervous to tell you like i confessed to you immediately because i wanted to like get that over with as soon as possible which i have to say breaks my heart because i want you to know that before all else in this relationship your happiness means the most i didn t know that it was gon na equal happiness until it was done i was going in hoping for the best it was never on my bingo card as the tick tockers say i didn t know that was something to talker say they re not on don t they how would you know did you just i don t i feel like i don t think that s the thing that anybody says this was not on my something for the something i know it s a trend for sure i know that it s a trend right anyways i got my ears Applause cute it looks so good thank you christopher no i walked in and chris was like are your ears pierced no first he said did you get new earrings did you get your ears pissed and he can t stop smiling at you like you had a baby or something no he looks so good he s very cute first off i m usually lost in his baby blue eyes which right just that s awesome it seems like he s coming to me he s literally engaged oh sorry my husband wants chris more than he wants me no what but he looks so good you really do look good there you look so good thank you well no so shane and i i guess we had been joking about like we on and off because in high school my best friend had done the piercing with the lemon like we really did did the thing when we would get blackout drunk i would just take a push pin out of the wall and just pierce my cartilage pop makes a sound like that oh it s not too bad no it really honestly was the sound was the most horrific part of it all yeah and when i got there well let me back up so shane had got i was opening my presents from shane and all of a sudden there s a box and i was like oh my god what is it and i m opening it and it s earrings i m like i don t have my appeared A A and he s like well we she ears were joking about it a while ago so i took a gamble because i didn t know if you d actually want to get your ears pierced but i thought they were so cute and when i saw them i thought oh my gosh so we re like he takes me on this birthday excursion because i didn t make any birthday plans because i m not like a a birthday girl the pressure of hosting an event is that it s a lot it s a lot of a wedding to me where it s like everyone come celebrate me but you don t want to facilitate responsible for everyone s good time and i would rather like i m so thankful i have shane that i love so much that i can just relax and have a great day with yeah and so he did surprise me with my ideal day and i honestly a few days before he had told me oh i i i booked something for us to do do you want me to tell you and i said no and then in my head i was thinking oh i would really like to go to my favorite restaurant that i never go to up on the rooftop where it looks over all of the hills and then i was like but i won t tell him because he s already booked something and i woke up and that is what he had booked for me it looks like he had read my mind yeah and so it couldn t have been more fabulous but we he got us a hotel room at the hotel under the restaurant so once we got there we went looking for places to get my ears pierced and i m seeking out these um ear piercers uh i m seeking their advice like my life depends on it i go okay so the boys normally get one or two and what about gay boys because i want to do the opposite of what gay people do because i m not super gay because wasn t it always the right ear or something is a tell tale sign of like i m down if you re down that one an indication of left was straight yeah interesting i would have thought it would have been the other who A A cares everybody has their ears pierced now and i thought well i d rather have it on the opposite side of my like engagement ring you just wanted mine is what you re saying yes so i started with juan and then she said well most boys honestly do end up doing both two s important i think two is a good move and since i had two earrings yeah i thought well i might as well do them both worst case scenario i ll just take one out and then yeah the whole time even in the vlog when we were filming i go see i m most nervous about having to justify to people that don t know i have my ears pierced that i now have my ear spears and why i did that and lizzy s going to drag me oh no i would never well i didn t know your reaction because you re so blunt you know yeah but it s like when you do things that bring spark joy for yourself that s not like ooh you know i didn t know if it was because you were doing something was like i d be like i don t know buddy let s talk about it but now that i have them i do feel as though they spark yeah they re great and i m inching closer to just morphing into the budget version of justin bieber who i once was yeah and that s always been your dream always so like don t give up keep like stay strong in your pursuit now we ll just start getting tattoos but i sat down we could come back he s got a A A rose on his neck i sat down with this lady and she started opening her needle and i said there s no gun because i always thought it was a needle claire s but like a needle gun s not great so they use a hollow needle in nice piercing places and that s what she said she said oh if you ever if you ever go to get a piercing and they whip out a needle gun run because that s not a professional piercing no you can buy that on amazon so of course that s what you do because your ears are pierced correct do you have one or two two i just i m lazy i wake up throwing a hat and go i never put my earrings on but uh but i got a needle kinda clear yeah i mean as long as it works everybody does it s just like for some people it doesn t work out very well i also think like they had to do it twice because the first time it was like the one side was too high so oh so she had to do it again and then i also had it closed because i had to go to school that didn t let me wear earrings i was very religious it was a whole thing so i ve had them re pierce many times but i have well i liked it initially when i did it in high school but i was going back oh you did pierce your ears in high school my friend did it with a needle and a lemon oh i didn t realize you meant you personally had done that uh my best friend did that to you wow and he had convinced me well if i buy the fake diamond will you do it well you let me do it and i thought yeah i ll do that but i went back to utah and i felt so much shame so oh god it s like well it s because it s yeah a lot of the people are religious and i just didn t want that judgment sort of what i was feeling when i was gon na have to tell you like i m as bad as the A A judgmental people in the mormons in utah no i love all of my mormon friends oh me too but you just said that they cause you great anxiety well it wasn t even them specifically but i do think that caused some issues in my uh in my uh early adulthood the first time i had gotten head i cried for like hours after because i thought i had sinned and i didn t even i wasn t even a part of the church but it was so ingrained in the culture around me right that i just felt so guilty about all of that sort of thing and my brother did too so it wasn t unique to me right so sex in general is a no no um i don t i don t even know i don t even know what was projected so sad but it s also so sweet thinking about you and austin sitting somewhere crying together about getting A A me too and the poor girl who did the sucking it s like oh a girl sucked your dick and made you cry yeah so this wasn t even a gay thing second i was like for the first time ryan s saying something huge about homosexuality on the podcast thank god i was a little no it was a hetero i was a ladies magnet and most likely because i didn t want them did you see that yeah it was all over the couch how did that happen oh like it s literally all over the couch all the girls in my life such as when i moved to hollywood i really wanted like when i moved here i had three or four girls lining up for me one was you no oh my god you admitted every week no but i knew you were gay you did yeah but you were also in love with me oh i m still in love with you i love you very much i have a great time with you but i always knew you were gay i remember when you told i was literally talking about this this morning to my friend mal he s like he s like so i m gay and i was like oh you think you need to tell people that like we ve always known that was a big thing for me too working at the restaurant i worked at not having told anyone i was gay before i was hooking up with men feeling as though i i didn t flat out lie to anybody but in a restaurant you re always talking about who you had hooked up with and what s your type and all of these things and i always just kind of stayed silent so i always felt as though i had been being silent was lying to people and once i was ready to come out i felt as though i had to tell everyone i ve been lying to them and i think that was more of the stigma that was hard right even though it was brought upon by myself nobody cared everyone just celebrated it so yeah i mean luckily so yeah i lived in los angeles where they liked the gays where were we going with this i don t know but this is like maybe one of the most profound what are the most profound episodes we ve ever had and i m having a stroke so i got my ears pierced i had a fabulous day shane got me the most elaborate beautiful cake in the world and i just couldn t have dreamt of anything better and i just feel so lucky and grateful to be and live another year although i did wake up in pain the day after my birthday and i had a neck thing i ve never had a neck thing neck thing and lizzy i feel like you manifested this neck thing into my life sorry about it i have a neck thing too do you want to feel it you can feel this knot it s literally like i said the joints are feeling free no this is like new from yesterday do you feel it oh from getting like whiplash we ll get into that in just a second but i also got a botched haircut it s all a big your hair is fine you keep saying that it s bob if you re gon na keep rubbing it do it a little harder yeah so this brings us to lizzy s kidnapping i got him good she did get me good it s like i had to like gaslight him though i had to tell him what it was and then i had to convince him well no you but your gas lighting was unintentional because you can t keep a secret so we re out hiking over the past week and i start guessing i was like well because i knew you thought it was disneyland so i had to say it s not what you think it is well cause she said it s an hour away wear like outdoor comfortable clothes you re gon na be in the elements and i thought well we always have been talking about going to disneyland we ve never made it so we re going to disneyland and i said i m just going to flat out say you re taking me to disneyland and she goes no the tickets were sold out they were and so then i guess okay six flags universal and then i said or four seasons because that s your other thing you enjoy doing is going to that pool in the spa i do and she goes not that but maybe one of the other things she had mentioned and i m like okay so we re going to an amusement park and then a couple days later she starts the gas lighting and she really had me convinced we were going to some sort of bear sanctuary i texted him and i said bring bear spray if you have it but if you don t i m sure we can get it there and then she goes the morning of i started my period so i don t know if they re gon na allow me to go anymore um and i was like oh my god wait what did i say i said A A i got my period i don t know if they ll even let us do the thing because it s too dangerous with my menstrual smell and i said are you serious i can t tell if your period is a nightmare we can reschedule i don t want you dying actually or metaphorically and then i started thinking wow what a privilege to not know how painful a period could be quite honestly am i years of age i never really sat there for a minute and thought how much pain could a person be in so then i thought you know what if she needs to reschedule i don t want her to be in pain and if a bear is going to eat us i don t want to die and i know like it sounds crazy i know there s not a bear world in california but there s you really thought we were going to go see some bears dude because the whole time we re driving he s like it s so funny this is the same way to six flags magic mountain but where s the bears and i thought the reason i was justifying it because she really did play it cool is i had been in a tutor and buddha music video back in the day just saying careful the copyright and and it was at this elaborate home owned place where there were all these wild animals all uh tiger king so i thought oh maybe somebody s humanely taking care of some bears and lizzy found this place and it was just gon na be quite a day uh turns out it was six flags and we had a fantabulous time um it really shows your age going to a roller coaster heavy theme park yeah that after you haven t been to one in probably i hadn t been in probably seven or eight years and we went fast and furious girlfriends we went on all these scary rides uh yeah i had all sorts of panic attacks well he keeps his eyes open the whole time so he s like oh my gosh oh my gosh that turns too tight where s the velocity it can t take it well yeah on the wood roller coaster i kept thinking this structure is not strong enough for this fast of a curve he s like saying it the whole time it s weird because time feels like it freezes some of these roller coasters are very quiet and then you re hanging in what feels as though it s dead air yeah and you just have all of this time to think to yourself and if you say anything out loud it feels like the whole coaster can hear you because there s no silence yeah and so yeah i m screaming lizzy violently closes her eyes the second it starts moving and she goes well i just don t like to know what happens and i said i disassociate and i said well don t you want to know what s going on and she goes no you still feel like the g force or whatever it is and i go i literally i go i go so that i like leave my soul leaves my body and then i hold my jaw a little bit slack so i don t bite my tongue off and then i you got to keep the rest of your body a little slack but you also got to keep it tight because you don t want to be like flopping around and hurting yourself but if you keep your eyes shut the whole time it s not that bad and that s my thing there s so many violent twists that if i didn t have my eyes open to prep my neck for the way that it was going to fly i think that s bad but no now you woke up with a crazy neck pain no i don t know about whiplash it s like i have a knot but it s like it s not like my spine s not fractured and i kept looking over and say could you please just join me on this we re doing this oh my gosh open your eyes you re like could you join me lizzy please join us back in reality and i m like no A A i m disassociating and this maniac brings his phone out on every single one well i got ta bring the vlog up to speed this is toxic and then the one really gon na cost him his life the superman one that puts you face down there wasn t a second we didn t do superman that s called tatsu okay it feels like superman because you re sitting like this and you re having a great time and all of a sudden before the ride starts you re peril your chest is parallel they hang you so that you re like sli like laying and there s no secondary reinforcement and so all that s holding you are the poles that are holding the initial harness and i thought well if this opens i m falling face first to my demise a thousand feet in the air and so that was so crippling to me that i couldn t even enjoy it i was just praying to god the whole time that i was gon na make it back onto the ground to live another day i was so scared on the west coast racers because before you go there s like a sign above the exit that says like put your neck in back on the back of the seat and i m just like A A what like you literally have to tell us to sit a certain way to come out of this a lot i almost passed out on that ride yeah that line that i on i might i felt my face rippling from the A A window it feels zero gravity a little bit too much yeah and then there was a moment where i was like i might go like like he s gon na faint i might exit the chat here and i ve never fainted to my knowledge so like the moment before where i thought i was fainting it was an interesting one yeah i also felt deeply wronged by the log rides and you always know it s good like that they re gon na have a big hefty drop that like just like A A like i can feel it in my stomach right now and there s no restraints on that A A either and it s like i just give me a A A seatbelt give me a lip service seat belt and i go can i give you my backpack and she goes no just bring it with you and i was like i don t think that s smart this A A is logging the whole time it is the funniest clip i ve ever seen in my life i do have to say that him screaming when he s like they re not going to give us a war at least well all the other all the other ones before the drop had like a moment the logs in front of us were stopped and so i thought oh i m going to have time to prepare my angle for this vlog and all of a sudden we get there and it never stops and then it just drops yes sorry and she s screaming at me to open my eyes but it was fun yeah a lot of people a lot of things to touch so i kept saying like shane s so sick of me bringing home coronavirus and norovirus yeah it was pretty funny the way he meant it too i was like wow are we going home with those things today because it s like he doesn t deserve it you know he doesn t leave the house and i really go out there and live like yeah i m in workout classes i m just the funniest thing is when i told joe about this when i got home he was like you guys don t like go anywhere though like you just like go to the gym and come home and i m like no we re like living out in these streets and those people are nasty and putting me they re dirty yeah well you also introduced me to dole whip which i would like to say i have never had before in my life but the joy that it sparked has revolutionized this chapter of my life and i m gon na A A go home and clean my room and i m gon na stop wallowing in this depression which is a toxic A A a dick emotional addiction of mine and i m gon na A A live with the joy of dole whip in my heart every day yeah she kept saying i have a new lease on life honestly i felt happy and we ve got to look up other places that you there are none it s only at theme parks i mean like i could get it oh chris knows of course chris knows sloane s ice cream at the village you re kidding me is it in the soft serve that like i mean i i know it s the same thing i don t know how this is but it s the same thing they get it from the same place that disneyland i don t want like a scooped ice cream i want it coming out of a machine yeah i think so i m pretty sure well looks like we just ruined our life yeah lives and a sudden but lizzie was very upset last week that she went out of her way to not correct my bad pronunciation and that nobody realized it in the comment section she s like what even is this if i do something nice everybody s like i wish he would A A stop well i stopped and no where s my praise i don t do it for the praise because the steamable acts like create a steam nonetheless i suppose but like listen now i know that it s wrong and i will say it correctly and every time i say it correctly i go yeah he hates it it s not good for him anyways anyway i guess is the correct way to say that you ve never got me on that but other people have when i go oh they get me on it all the time they re like lizzy doesn t speak right either it s like right but if someone were to correct me i d start trying harder and nobody does no i never will except from the comment section when i see you guys do that i do my best to change it so i got home and i was so uh exhausted from such a fun weekend and honestly you re very funny i laughed the whole day with you you re like you re very i have a lot of fun with you that was so fun you re very and i was laughing so much because you re very funny which is funny because if you look at his vlog footage i m miserable the whole time i m like because you live so hard she was like i have to get a diet coke she chugs the whole diet coke in less than two seconds says the best diet coke this is the best diet coke i ve ever had in my life we immediately get on a ride like a crazy roller coaster seconds after she chugs a huge diet coke and that s where she goes i m not well i look so sick anywhere there was hand railing i was leaning on it to the point of like my arms turning white from the weight i was putting on i said yeah that s like eating the biggest meal of your life and jumping in a pool it doesn t work like that no it was awful but the dole whip brought me back so then when i got home i passed out on the couch because i was so tired and i was spinning like i was on a roller coaster i thought those roller coasters were gon na give me vertigo i don t think it s the ver i don t i honestly the roller coasters didn t A A me up as bad as those swings those swings ruined me i got off and i was like um the one children s ride that we went on it was i had to close my eyes on that too like it was awful and then they just started sitting you down and your legs are suddenly dragging on the earth like it was a great birthday surprise and it was very very much i think you need to segue us into our next topic ugh our psychotic husbands must be stopped i just like honestly i think joe oh no it s not joe um but so this like joe regularly doesn t give a A A when i m honestly choking to death like i ll take handfuls of vitamins in the morning and like sometimes my throat s dry because i m a dehydrated mess but that s changing because of dole whip so i ll take a handful of like pills and like the other morning they got stuck in my dry throat like literally my body was like like i was doing the full blown choke thing i m completely alone and i m just trying to like chug some tea like get something liquidy in there to like break up the A A pills that are dry stuck in my throat and then i just start going like wretching like my body starts trying to project them out of my throat and joe s like in the room with the door open can totally hear me A A dying in the kitchen and doesn t give a A A it doesn t give a A A i finally get it out because it s like it like comes out because i m like and it s later baby did you not hear me throwing up in the A A kitchen he s like no i did but i just like thought you know it ll be over soon so if i die he he did it honestly he did it and then on top of that he before you segue into this i just want to say it s my biggest fear to be with somebody that s choking and me not knowing how to properly execute the heimlich maneuver absolutely me too we need like we need to take a million videos on it and i still don t think i ll be able to execute so we should take a class we need to we should take a class let s do that because i want to be certified for babies and people yeah yes okay um and then this psycho every day and i love him honestly i love him so much that i could cry right now because i kind of miss him because he s so cute but he does this thing where he ll take a fruit and he ll eat half of it or cut a piece of it out and then put it back and then go about his day and let it rot all week he lets it rot and then he s like no it s because of you it s like no it s not because like the apple you cut the apple he cuts the apple then throws the rest of the apple back in the fruit bowl and then we ll pick up another apple a fresh apple with no cuts out of it and do it again and then this morning i m at A A ryland s house before we do the A A and i get a text from him did you throw the apples away no A A i A A ate your rotten apples and i eat your rotten bananas but you re A A done we

counter all day it s insane and then lizzie goes into my pantry because she was like i need some something and she goes all these things are empty and she starts yeah all of her A A is empty and i was like try having a husband i do honestly that s the other thing joe leaves empty A A potato bags potato chip bags everywhere should we kill them they re dead like this is A A crazy it s always because shane has so many talents and he s so wonderful and so thoughtful and so good at so many things but when it comes to like i don t think he s ever loaded or started the dishes in his entire life my god joe also A A so we were talking about sinks we have a white porcelain sink and that A A scratches and stains and it s a A A nightmare so i bought plastic things to put in the bottom of it like little guards so that pots and pans don t scratch them and turn it whatever joe hates them for some reason joe hates the A A sink liners so he s always taking them out of the way and then smashing pots and pans in it to the point that the pots and pans are denting and there s A A scratches and scrapes all over the A A sink and he s like can you not put my scrubber in the sink it s like can you not destroy every A A surface in this house because if you can do that i ll definitely put your A A scrubber on the outside for the two days of the month that you use the scrubber and with all this being said all day yesterday we were thinking we need to get home to our husbands because we love them so much do you miss shane he goes yeah i got me too except for joe Laughter but they must be stopped

urine right now dude come on get a little closer baby during our little break when we had to stop rolling and re roll i went pee behind the shed because i didn t want to walk all the way to the house also didn t even check what it s like on my head right now because i m covered in urine i m standing i like i pop a squat right by the fan i like make sure there s no snakes around i look for the cleanest patch they find it i m popping my squat all of a sudden the fan turns on and my hair starts worrying no and it s A A blowing the peepee so the peepee s all over me now and then i tried to use my skirt to wipe it up but it s like quite frankly like there s piss everywhere on my body and it s all because i turned on the fan yeah literally all because i heard it were on and i was like i wonder what that s gon na do and then it was like like being in A A twister with your own peepee great flick anyways okay do you want me to talk i feel bad talking about this because it s going to ruin everyone else s life but my life was ruined so i feel as though all of you my biggest A A pet peeve is when i don t know that it s mercury retrograde and some A A tells me it s mercury retrograde my the yoga teacher she s like okay things are wonky and that s cause it s mercury retrograde and i was like i was living in a fantasy until just now but did anything go wrong everything what well did you just get stuck in a piss storm no what s wrong what s wrong with your retrograde you tell me i ve had a great retrograde since the this weekend but up to then i was really stressed by your own design and then in that same class some man has to come along and be better at yoga than me and that s the first time that s the sign of mercury right the first time in about seven years that somebody out not that anyone s yoga practice is for anyone but themselves the least yogi A A thing i ve ever heard but when someone s out here doing handstands with their legs contorted in crazy positions when it s not even called for in the class right and it s not something i can hold for longer than seconds i m A A pissed did you follow him home did you follow him home no but then i did practice handstands all weekend wow and i m going to show up to that yoga class and next time that man is there ty will be there right next to him doing A A matching what he s doing yeah let s do that and tell him it s mercury retrograde see if it A A up his weak i will not allow my greatest hobby to be ruined this is toxic this is crazy now everyone s on their own path i m not even looking at other people in yoga he was just distracting he sounds like you saw some people though he wanted the whole uh scene to see him it was out of the flow that s what i mean like i m not looking at everyone while i m doing yoga it was distracting but also something i would do if i could so there s a guy that like frequents the orange theory i go to a lot who runs like a cartoon villain like on the balls of his feet like his heels never touch the ground and he s he his knees go high like with every step he takes and his hands are like it s wild he literally runs like a cartoon villain and i m always thinking like should someone correct that like that can t be good for his whole body demeanor yeah it s not uh whatever nobody s ever corrected him all right well let s get into some iced tea uh jesse williams broadway act well he s an actor of all calibers was on grey s anatomy people love him so much he was on broadway and he s doing a role that requires nudity and somebody had leaked it on twitter and i make a nude photo of him on video video you haven t even seen it here s the thing i intentionally will never ever look at or participate in a leaked nude photo yeah i understand i saw it did you seek it out it kind of hits you in the face well did you seek it out when i said you don t even go on twitter when i saw no i wasn t going on twitter but when i saw all the when i saw that it was happening i googled it right so you sought it out so i yeah i guess so i mean i wanted to see the context in which i mean i also didn t not want to see it but i i did want to see the context in which it was leaked and i wanted more information it was probably just a phone snuck into the show yeah therein i found the actual video itself but the thing is yes it was not consensual and obviously it s wrong if i go to a theater there s no world in which a i m going to go against the rules of the theater and bring my phone in there b disrupt the whole audience s experience by pulling out my phone which we know is a nightmare such a nightmare and then and i ve had enough of apple watches too quite frankly post this for the entire world to see like it is awful but at the same time everyone s reaction is mortified and so but like some of the titles on youtube i was just like rolling my eyes out because it was like he seemed to care and that was my so uh the titles that i had saw made it seem as though he had been so like violated which it is violating there s no doubt about it but the thing is then yeah i went and i looked for like his actual response to it and he was he did comment saying his response was like it s like shrug consent is important but i m fine and i m not worrying about it and i think well yeah because if you re doing a play that requires nudity you re obviously comfortable enough with yes you weren t trying to blast it out to the world yeah but you re comfortable enough and it s not as though previous celebrities that have done new roles did not go viral for being naked i remember seeing daniel radcliffe harry potter s penis all over the place from when he was in the naked play and i don t know if the rules were different but i m assuming phones weren t allowed in that play either no phones are never allowed out during theater because what the A A and you certainly shouldn t be recording because it s so disrespectful and it s so rude and it s also like when you re recording that this person on the stage that s doing a job you re now making them work for you with that clip and it s with no compensation there s a lot of things that are wrong with it besides it just being rude all of it s wrong all of it s wrong and you know and leaking anybody s body parts on the internet without their consent is just so A A yeah and i i don t care i know i mean i i care and i m grateful that he s shrugging it off and saying like it s not the biggest deal because i also feel that way like i know a lot of people will spend a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of their resources to figure out who s putting nude photos of them on the internet and to some degree i m like now you re double losing yeah and i think he was confident enough to show his human form in front of whoever buys a ticket i do think it s great publicity for the show i know it s not the wanted publicity but i think that show s going to be sold out for the rest of its run and i think because he s comfortable with his body i mean he is very well endowed in doubt and so of course he s not embarrassed and it s like why would he be like oh i m so upset i mean even if you hate your body at any rate it s just A A stop doing this stop leaking people s nudes what the A A just A A stop yeah it s so creepy and weird do you want us to release your A A nudes you creep A A are you joking would you love that would you love going into a meeting with your A A boss knowing he s seen your A A dick or your hoo ha knock this A A off and what the A A is wrong with you sorry i m so mad about it i don t think it was the worst thing to ever happen to him no i don t think it s the worst thing to ever happen to anyone but it s like just but the people who do it A A knock that A A off yeah i mean i agree it s definitely morally incorrect but it s just it s obnoxious as A A okay let s talk about something fun famous people s heights different oh okay so i saw this crazy A A picture of the cast of big little lies i m just like i what in the vortex A A is this oh it s nicole kidman it s nicole kidman zoey kravitz reese witherspoon and shaylene woodley yeah show chris chris here let me just hand the phone to you it is bananas i thought it was photoshopped and i go lizzy did you look into the facts of this no this is some photoshop this is some wild A A we looked up their height nicole kidman is and a half shayleen woodley is five eight probably just wearing some high high heels yeah and reese and zoey are five foot one and five foot two but the juxtaposition in the photos is out of this it s like girls with their american girl dolls they have scenes in big little eyes together i wonder if part of the blocking is not making it absurd it s got to be because it s visually absurd how much tinier these women are than these other women and none of them are big women you know what like that s a tall person but all of them have like the width of like a candlestick they ve got to work around that on the show it s like how could they even be friends like this is like you know what i mean it s wild i have a tiny friend that i will make move to a different point like a different vantage point in position in a photo because she makes me look so big it s also like who was taking this photo and who didn t think about adjusting the photo before they posted the phone yeah like maybe put reese and zoe like way out in the foreground and like pull our pull A A kidman and woodley back it just doesn t look real it literally no it looks like girls playing with american girl dolls i thought it was photoshopped it s crazy it s like gulliver s travels like what the A A is this and while we re talking about photos lizzy screenshotted another photo from another article of yeah this is whack what her lizzie s headline is what was it i can t even or something or i m done with you i didn t put it in the document sorry well we ll never know what headline was but i black out what i said well can you not react in real time no i ve already reacted in real time julia fox wears a bra on panties to go get food enough is enough she said enough is enough in all caps julian fox wears a bra and panties to go food shopping in hollywood and she s taken a pair of pants and made it into a purse and she s wearing like a A A denim trench coat like i m sorry girly girl the grocery store is not the spot you go when you re brawn A A panties and i have a completely opposite opinion oh you think it s great i think it s everything oh my gosh if i had the confidence to do this if i took my daughter shopping and there was a man wearing just underwear and a A A trench coat i m calling the police it s no different than a bikini though for her if there s a A A in the grocery store wearing just a bikini i m irritated okay i understand your frustration your weird body away from my A A food when i say weird body i just mean like all bodies are weird we all like excrete A A i ve got a A A skin fungus i m not walking into a A A grocery store in a bathing suit okay take the bathing suit out of it her making weird accessories out of things that are of everyday items the pants purse is not the worst it s a it s she s like being ironic and it s like do i give a A A about your irony i don t i almost want to like get on my youtube channel and try making the diy myself and going and trying to get paparazzi with my pant purse i know i just said i think it s bad but i wouldn t mind being part of that i wouldn t mind being part of it because a little bit of me is like god i want a tiny bit of julia s confidence what i mean like there s no second thought it s like i m gon na do this i can t even get earrings without texting you and fear that you might not like them even if like it doesn t matter she s out in the street wearing like A A suffocation claws you think hey it s in my sound and so let s get our worst pair of jeans that we never wear anymore and let s do this okay um the last thing is that there s a couple things kylie jenner couldn t even get lizzy to the billboard music awards couldn t even get her to flip on the television you know who was so cute stormy miss stormy webster slay in that carpet my god girlie you re a great don t stop how cute she is she s so precious she must be protected at all costs i A A love me some stormy webs the billboard music awards were so boring i clicked in just to see what was going on and i really tried to give it a minute where i know you this might not be on the docket but i am legit like is his name jack harlow oh who is that that s what i i wrote who the A A is jack carlo and why are all these girls acting or maybe they do want to sleep with him it s just girls are acting like who is this guy he s he s a very big rapper no but like what are his raps what do you mean like he s i know i know him truthfully from the there s a little nazak song i was like i told you oh i can t say it but uh wait why can t you say we re not gon na get copyrighted before you singing A A it might be good oh yeah he does yeah and how long has this man been around because i feel like all of the sudden i think he s been around for a while but just not like super mainstream but he s getting his attention now i do i think i hate him well i think i hate him just because everyone loves him and i don t know who he is i hate him because of what i have seen of him i m like is this real well it s probably gon na be one of these things where in a month i m going to say i love jackpot right right to me it feels like that joaquin phoenix like like when he cosplayed his life as like a dejected actor who became a rapper and did that horrible documentary that made everyone uncomfortable like that s what this feels like well i put this in the document because i thought you spending all your time on tick tock you definitely know all i ve seen is all i ve seen of him on tik tok i m like i don t know what he does and i don t like what i ve seen him do like all i see is him stealing other people s songs and then like yeah like there s a fergie song which is like first class oh that s what they were performing last night and that s when i wrote this on the document because i was like who is this man right and then i m like why the A A this isn t like what does he do because all i see is him going and everyone s like and i m like i don t get the allure and he seems bad he performed at one of the coachella parties and everyone like every youtube person i follow was like acting like their panties were dropping and they couldn t believe that they saw jack harlow in person and i thought who is this i saw him what am i missing yeah i saw him be weird with emma chamberlain on the red carpet at the met he s like yeah she s like love yet well i think she was nervous because she was fluttered because she loves him too i think you read the room wrong no i think everybody thinks that was a weird exchange yeah but i don t think on his part i think her her being like cute and awkward about it was what was right or endearing i think sure but the bottom line is like i don t know jack A A about jack harlow me either so we re going to what i think no but like what i do know is like i also watch some of the kentucky derby having his boys carry his tiny ass across the A A derby dirt so that he didn t get his shoes dirty i mean he s a rapper they ve got to be protected those shoes okay let s move on yeah today s podcast is sponsored by liquid iv when you push your body too hard or feel run

should showed share she shares she s never not shared a toothbrush with her now boyfriend that she lives with so so there s so many negatives in this that i m confused let s boil it down she she exclusively shares the toothbrush okay so the way she only shares a toothbrush let me let me paint the picture for you i wish you just answered me so you said sunny goes yes or no so you said that you were never gon na share your bed again not only do you have a new boyfriend but ever since you ve had this boyfriend you ve said that you have always shared your toothbrush with him you guys exclusively together have one toothbrush and she said yes that s true i ve never done this with another partner in my life but we do share a toothbrush ah i don t know all the money in the world you can t get another A A toothbrush Laughter like pixel s not kicking back enough and her argument was that well we put our mouths in crazier places and yeah and that s why you need a A A toothbrush so i wouldn t do it if i was in a super pinch on vacation and shane and i only had one if it was new yeah i d say okay if it s the one he d been using for a month yeah i d have to question do you remember when we made a sketch about this when in our in our youth no when we were cute young girlies and you lived in an apartment and we made a sketch that caught that was called officially in love and i and my character come so i m excited i m like guess who just got a toothbrush at so and so s house because like having a toothbrush at a partner s house is like a big deal oh did you share the toothbrush though no i had my own toothbrush okay maybe i ll find that and insert i ll show it to you i remember it i think that s the one where i had a dick on my face no that was a different one oh my mom cried after that one which like breaks my heart to this day vicki i m so sorry this is when she thought maybe i was going to be on a respectable path in life not that i m not i m like i i did this sketch with ryland and this other girl and the whole thing is like ryland s hell of juice because he just got back from erawan he s like i just got recognized and we re like oh my god no A A like that s A A epic and he like turns and it s like oh honey penis people are looking at you because you have a dick on your face and he goes not again it s funny because we re funny yeah you produced some some some good sketches that i think that that script was better than the execution of it because we broke the line a couple times and we were working with the constraints of that girl being awful to work with right so it didn t turn out great and all of this whole thing happened because yesterday lizzie uses headphones in her car and she didn t bring her headphones so i said i don t have my airpods either and she goes i wouldn t use them even if you did it s gross and then i thought oh well i was just offering to be nice but now that i think of it it is pretty gross i know it s like i m the gross part of it i ve got waxy ass ears like i m basically deaf because of how much wax i have in my A A ears i m not trying to give you your A A back and have you be like A A okay your wax all up in my expensive A A airpods let s get to our tv reviews before we get into some advice okay you re disturbed i m disturbed by the latest episode of the flight attendant but to be fair i m not sure what days it airs so there might be another one out already now but i think i m talking about episode five did you see it i don t think so yeah god i m so alone in this drama you don t watch it do you chris and then it s like what am i even doing and talking about it here but there s i don t want to plot i m an episode i think i m on episode four i m just going to tell you what happens because you put it on the docket you put it on the docket i can t believe you put your A A scenes behind i told you to watch it okay i m going to pip it we ll have a no let s finish the series and then we ll do a review of the show because i don t know like the first thing you promise the first season of flight attendant like you said it slapped but it s a complete story it felt like they had told the story that needed to be told but it was such a hit that they re trying to do it again yeah and there s still a lot of elements that are very fun in it yeah the storyline does almost feel like why are we why are we here here i m gon na watch it yeah like what are we doing here yeah and they re like trying to make it about like her addiction recovery and it s like season one s about admitting i have a problem and now seasons two season two is about like how do i but it s like they ve missed they ve missed the mark on it i think because some of the magic was the mystery of season one and there is a mystery but it s a plotty mystery and it s not an emotional mystery it s like a new show that i think all of you should be watching is i love that for you it s on showtime with molly shannon it is so fun like every element from the opening little theme song and credits to oh it just i love nothing more than a desperate person wanting to be in show business because that s been my whole life and i just love when people are up front about it and it s about like qvc right their qvcs coast it s called something it s like svn love um but it s so fun and then i listened to molly shannon on the armchair expert podcast and i didn t know that her past was so like in deep like like she s had a past yeah she s been working her whole life well no i mean when she was four her they her dad crashed a car that her whole family was in and her mom and her sister had passed away and that was like the catalyst of the beginning of a whole like i just had never known that much about molly shannon and this show has made me this i love that for your show like i m so late to the party but now i m like molly shannon s number one fan oh i A A love molly shannon i love molly shannon and i i m just gon na share my my shannon story because it s not even like a molly shannon story but it s like i love molly shaded so much so it s like it s my molly shannon story so when i was eight uh superstar came out and i always auditioned for the school talent show but i had parents that didn t really play a hand in my artistic development they were very hands off they wanted me to do my own thing well your dad s a lawyer right no oh my stepdad s a lawyer sorry chris but um but uh yeah so like like some parents are like let me see what you re bringing to the talent show audition before you go so you don t embarrass the family nobody ever said that to me so like i go out and i do the mary katherine gallagher scene where she s auditioning for the talent show and i do all the dialogue from it but i didn t memorize the same song as her so i m because i just didn t know it i knew one song at the time and i think it was like it s a i think it was a goo doll song and i think it s always rains like hell on the losers day parade like it s not a song an eight year old should be singing while doing a molly shannon superstar impression okay and it was mortifying anyways loved her point being have always loved her will always love her cut two a few weeks ago my god sister s a senior in high school and she s doing her senior showcase and i i m like can i get a ticket like where do i get a ticket she s like i ll get you a ticket when you get to the box office tell them you re molly shannon and i was like i don t think that they re gon na buy that because molly shannon s daughter is friends with my god sister and they go to the same school so molly shouldn t have bought a A A ton of tickets in the one row and i was just supposed to say like i m molly shannon to get one of those tickets and i was like i can t do that because they re gon na know sally on the street yeah and then it s like i was telling the same story to my god brother and he goes who s molly shannon again and i m like what the A A is wrong with america today this is why we have problems well that s why we fight i hope this showtime show brings a new generation to her she s so good and she s so good in the other two i haven t seen that but oh my god you would love the other two we are the other two okay i m gon na watch oh my god and i have you seen the other two we are the other two you re the gay A A brother and i m the A A loser trying to get in sister okay i m gon na watch it and morgan s justin bieber justin bieber s in it no but it s like the other two are the the older siblings of who uh a character that s justin bieber this young boy rises to pop star fame okay and the other two are his older siblings that are in there oh is this a show too yeah i don t want to watch that it s really good um but we love you molly shannon yeah and i highly recommended the even listening to her story in getting on snl and how she hustled into hollywood and where it just is very fascinating she seems like the brightest light in every room also was in the same room with her wow it was sick big flex sickening big flicks i was like molly and i was like just kidding i didn t i didn t say that but i did like i did one of those things where it s like you re like scanning the audience and you like you like see her but you re like i m not looking at you i m looking at you i feel like we should save our hacks review until like we re later in the season as well yeah i got ta rewatch the first two episodes but i do say it was particularly rude for you to rub in again that i m not playing that role well there was a couple moments that were just you and they weren t exec executed as well as you would do and i m not A A on the actress i like the actress but i just do i do like the actors okay but that doesn t mean i don t wish that you were that active thank you and i wish that you would have at least gotten the opportunity to i wish that anyone was A A looking for me because this has come up again too like on that show that i m working on they re like we don t want you to seem too much like hacks and i m like is this you guys also pointing out that they made a huge mistake by not A A calling me i have to keep a list of all the shows i m watching right now because there s so many this is us candy i do want to watch candy you have you put it on i don t know i haven t tried it yet i m getting a little bit tired of these super slow true crime dramas okay makes sense it feels like all of these shows should have had the balls to be like we don t have enough for hours of content but give us a minute movie and we ll be great you know what i mean like no one tried to make monster into a A A scripted series that s episodes okay well we have some really good advice submissions and i think i m just gon na do the one short one for today because we re out of time okay but this is a follow up to a girl that we re gon na revisit the first part of her question next week wait so there s a prequel there s a prequel but the two are unrelated got it like she sent a follow up voicemail got it um so we re doing part two today and we ll do part one next week cheeky just cause this one s shortened to the point get it girl um i mean if it doesn t make sense chronologically i will be irritated with you it makes sense chronologically don t you worry her first one s more profound but but anyways do you stand to wipe your poop or do you sit and wipe your poop i recently found out six years in that my fiance dance to white and i got the egg but i stick to white so i don t know what do you guys do please answer in the next video i don t know this is a question that has plagued mankind since toilet paper was invented i love her by the way yeah her first one s great as well um what do you mean it s plagued mankind there s only one right answer that s what you d think that s what i know on the count of three tell me do you sit we say sit or stand okay so it s three two one then you say it no it s one two three and do you say it on three or after three after three we say sit or stand okay one two three stand you re so sick chris sit yeah you re sick you guys are A A crazy no you re A A crazy you listen to that girl s voicemail she got the ick from her A A fiance who is you you guys are nuts no you re nuts you re mushing poop into your butt crack to stand to wipe it no there is only one answer and i knew this A A had the wrong one dude oh my god oh my god all of a sudden y all like oh sudden i m saying it s stupid no i m saying you say that wrong so obviously you stand up to wipe your ass wrong too i can t quit i just want to say in my brain when you re sitting down your cheeks are spread open already and and what so you wipe it but when you want you re clamping them together and smearing the poop okay listen okay chris first back to front or like under the legs or over the hole do you stop chris from behind her from the front uh from this way it s back to your balls yeah like no it s front to back sorry yeah so you go through your legs or behind your legs i m not asking the direction so you re you re holding you re going yeah and i wipe front to back yeah you guys are nuts Laughter i don t know how i would be able to maneuver sitting there so you just have your whole penis unit rubbing across your arm while you get A A all over your A A i like stand squat over the

fact you can google it what you can literally google is lizzie gordon s french bulldog icky cuter than all three of ryland adams s dogs combined i don t know golden retrievers i think are higher up on the desired list of then why are they so affordable i m canceled over that god damn it we re in a rough couple weeks here bro i m feeling it we do the best we can around here hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay what prompted you to say gordon a few weeks back i say gordon and home okay all the time and i go between lizzie and elizabeth on this podcast because it s my life and it s now or never cause we ain t gon na live forever see if i was listening to the podcast i would have clicked out that would have been it for me for this episode so thank you all for sticking around because when lizzy starts singing i love you so much but it s one thing i just i feel like it s not something you were blessed with like you re blessed so much i know and it s A A devastating because it s the only way i want to express myself and it really honestly more than anything in this world i feel like nobody could possibly understand me because i m not capable of expressing myself through song appropriately like there s a feeling in here you know what i mean there s a feeling in my chest that i m trying to get out of my body and it s like when the little mermaid sells ursula her voice and it s like i was born without even the ability to sell this voice i ve been robbed yeah but nothing s taking away the ability for you to produce a great song because it s never stopped anything i mean i can t write a song either oh well then i don t feel like you were gifted any of them no but it s like i need it it s like my soul wants it and i can t produce it for myself we were both supposed to be pop stars and it didn t pan out for us so now we re hallmark movie queens yeah yeah hopefully all right well what s going on with you well i ve got one of your dog s hair in my eyes i swear this woman all day long has said oh no there s something in my eye and i m like because there is have you not gotten the one thing out of your eyes when would i have found the time riley i just don t when would i have found the time so the one thing has been there all day or it s like multiple things like you just have an abnormal amount of things flying in your head you want to keep being insensitive to my eye issues i m going to start just ripping my celiac ass all over this couch eye sensitivity my dog uno is really going through it it is right sixth birthday and the day before the little boo boo scratched his eye and he s has the cone of shame and i don t know how it happened the vet said honestly like he could have been running through a bush or anything it s like it s small so i don t think it s a tiny little scratch but it s enough to produce like some discomfort and tears and what did you say to him today what did you have the nerve to do to my dog careful careful and guess what i do to him is harsh i called him a cry baby and i said but i was just so insensitive to the feelings of my animals here s what i do love about you rylan was so upset by poor una being inflicted on his birthday with an eye injury that he said i m not going to tell una that today s birthday we re going to celebrate it next week when is high s better and i think that s sorry i did the sentiment on instagram so everyone knew it was his birthday they were like sending him well happy wishes in spirit but for his actual party i m gon na say next friday after his vet checkup after like i get to go ahead you re gon na go hog wild crazy i m gon na probably order a dog cake like you know the dog bakeries yeah yeah i might just go all out because uno is my entire heart and well you have two other children so well they re not here they can t hear me no i m kidding i love all honey s nearby i love they all have a special place in my heart but you know has the biggest place yeah so much makeup on your teeth help me help me help me you got you got it you just got it um okay so we have a lot going on for today s episode yeah i think we got ta again talk about the fact that i have a huge zit on my cheek we know i know is it the same day you didn t take off i took the patch off because makeup started collecting underneath it and that s it it s much better without the patch quite honestly the patch was pretty distracting i think you got to go full blown into like our waitress today at lunch she had a bright yellow star sticker on her pimple patch for some reason i could see yours way more than i could like you walked out of the uber today and i was like what s on her face it s because mine s clear so you could see all the white cup like coming but we got home and lizzy goes oh our waitress had a zip patch on and i said i didn t even notice that so maybe it was just shocking because it was bright yellow and a star so maybe i just thought it was part of her photo was just not looking at her face well there were like seven waitresses for some reason honestly that s that s true like there were like seven righteousnesses and i have to say like i A A so hard with those pickles and i m sick as a dog we got fried pickles i don t think the restaurant s what made you sick i think it s that you ate all the freeze dried candy in my pantry you can t have that classic i m honestly a mess it was classic lizzy i m like you re gon na be sick and she goes they taste healthy and i was like those are the most unhealthy tastes but that s what s A A up about the freeze dried nature of a candy because they do seem healthy it s like eating a vegetable chip no it doesn t seem like that at all it has the most flavor of anything i ve ever seen in my life and it boils down like powder it like blows flavor through your being and if i m like salivating and i go lizzy you re probably going to want to stop and she s like no i m fine i could have one i could have just one and she eats both bags and then she goes i m so sick i m so sick but you do this to yourself i wonder if those are why i m like crapping my pants right now i d well did you successfully no i never successfully have movements at your house it s the altitude or it s the demon in the basement it s not the demon in the basement but the other night shane did have to sleep in the guest room we had a big blow no i m kidding he we uh had an air conditioned person coming really early and he didn t want to wake up and transfer beds so he was in the guest room and he said very bad vibe in there stop i m in the you always do this no no cause i defended the guest room and i said i slept in there one night because why was i sleeping didn t we already confirm that the bad vibe is attached to shane like it s there s a dark passenger that follows him he didn t like the feng shui of the room no the whole if you think about the room too deeply it s disturbing but the thing is the bed that s in there should i mean a bed should be facing the window yeah the bed is stunning and it can t face the window because it needs to like take your breath away so there s nothing wrong with the room there s something wrong with the designer the feng shui well i haven t designed that room yet it sounds like you put a bed in there that you feel it has to be um it was leftover furniture that moved into there and one of my next stops i have like a lot of things that i need to accomplish before i make my way into the guest room but the guest room will also be a nursery what s gon na yeah what s gon na happen to that bed in there that s i think it will go to the basement and just be like a big play room with a nice funky bed actually that s that s a good vibe yeah because when we have the kids yeah the whole basement will be finished and like one huge open play room and that can be like a central place where do i go when you have the kid down there this kid is really forcing me out of my comfort zone this kid s literally so far in this one trip this kid has literally claimed my job and my sleep what do you mean your job oh because right i m sure they re going to be great i get i get where you re going with that um okay well do you want to start did you post something on instagram i posted something on instagram and did you get anything i got some good stuff i be i you know how long it takes me to figure out how to work at instagram oh my gosh we could be here for hours oh me and i keep just going right past it do you want to get to your hometown hot goss first no i want to give her enough time to get back to me you think it s going to happen while we re recording you think we could be so fortunate no i don t think that s how today s going but i do i want to like relish in my hometown hero moment okay so lizzy if you don t remember i m not i m just what are you doing i m teasing you yeah that was enough of a taste well no give them no more what if they re on and what if they re not what if they you give them as much as you want to give them which is everything okay go along but if you don t have anything and it s dead air i m gon na be pissed no matter what i have the updates okay no i do i have the updates okay we want the details of the update yes i agree okay come on move along i m sorry that i have that i actually i am such a harsh critic of your ability it s not a joke it s real life this is my life find a new ideation alliteration what would you call that iteration A A okay so i posted on my instagram story because you and i were concerned that we would have nothing to talk about that my tummy ache was gon na claim this whole episode way to tease the episode if we tell them we re bored spoiler no we re not bored we re just useless yeah um so so well i did one of those ngl links also when we get to that i need to know what does ngl stand for no idea i m not gon na lie i maybe but why is it like that like no matter what when you do like an ask me anything or whatever it s all anonymous anyways right not you can see the profile you can click on the problem the person that asked the question so these are completely anonymous so would not gon na lie be like i m gon na say something to you that i wouldn t otherwise say to your face i think so i think it s like tea so it should be ready yeah i keep seeing everyone post these on instagram and i haven t done it so yeah we could and i did it for like the podcast so we ll see what they have for us well i love that i just threw up in my mouth a little bit unrelated and what i promised so i posted on mine because i didn t understand not gon na lie i just posted tell me something shocking okay and i am shocked by some of the results oh speaking of shocked what well i ll wait okay now that s a teaser i can get behind mr clickbait okay um this is great okay so if you go down with lipstick on your teeth is it still there it keeps going on and on i i don t know stop it the potty told me to do this okay it s been five minutes and you haven t read one shocking give me a minute no i m guessing okay so wait hold on what did you say i said something about shane the other night to you and then you said you think your life is come on i don t remember it was in text message though it was about your bodily function i know but you don t understand i m literally blacked out and i know everyone every time i m like i can t find our text they re like you can search your texts and i m like that makes no sense to me what you just go back and you hit you pull down and search a word it s gon na be forever ago no it was literally last night no it wasn t yes it was i have it right here you texted me i have a cone head and a puppy and just to feed them and let them out takes me an hour right now i said you think your life is hard joe just heard me fart i was in my room just blasting grumpies and A A i hear joe outside the door and you can hear him like come to the door and then decide not to come in the bedroom well yeah after i smelt what your flavor is that s why i have french bulldogs it s like literally joe doesn t listen to the podcast so i can say this freely i have to have a french bulldog in my life at all times because i ve been blaming my farts on them forever and this is blasphemous and but it s funny every time i rip ass near icky i go it smells like jelly so that i m conditioning those around me to think that for all those years i know that is dark i know and the way that i m allowed to joke about it because i m grieving hard so you re one is that not a little bit brilliant i mean it s if that s how jelly s living on through you no poor jelly s just been taking credit for some A A something s wrong with me type of A A gas i should see a doctor we both need to i m i m not as concerned about the smell of mine but the stomach aches i get frequently oh i m concerned like this A A is like something is dead inside me okay well let s hear about other people s shocking news well this wasn t about other people but i can t find it in here and i don t screen grab anything because oh there it is oh my gosh okay do i say who told me it s just screenshots oh man i just went away again kidding me scrolling how does this work okay so i don t tell you who it is i don t know how do i take a picture of just her just screenshot it and we ll zoom in later you what i m frustrated because they don t they can t see what s going on and you re like being so technology technically challenged this is what is like driving me nuts because they re like twiddling their thumbs probably thinking of some like what they re gon na eat for dinner at this point well i m doing a best and this is why i don t use the vlog camera can i get to what shocked me yes well it was you no this girl just shocked me with this back okay okay snapple fact kangaroos have three vaginas three which one do you A A i m not a human but i don t know do i get to pick does it matter which one is it dealer s choice or is it just one vagina it s like the the whoever is A A it who s not me like the other the kangaroo that s A A it not not that i would A A a kangaroo i m just thinking but if i did does a female kangaroo get A A by three at the same time i don t want to say absolutely if there s three vaginas what s stopping it i mean i guess you have a butthole and a vagina and you re not getting A A through both of them and i have a mouth wow and some women do get A A in all three holes and there s nothing wrong with it but i wouldn t say my mouth is a second vagina no nor would i liken my anus to one eye have you ever had one in each no i m one in two no i m not a dp girl not trying to get all plugged up have you toyed with the idea of because every man has a prostate do you ever slip a finger up no i know that seems gay but i m telling you and i m not after and it s gon na feel gay for him too but after he realizes what he s been missing it s like might be the best episode we ve ever made i m just saying it s something that both parties should explore because why would i want to explore putting my finger in someone s butt get a small dildo it doesn t have to be big but i m saying if you can do you know what i think of when you say get a small dildo what i m like oh i could use my shane dawson chapstick because that s like a pot it looks like a pocket vibrator a lot of people go through my purse and find the chapstick because i use shane s chapstick and they they ask like is this a pocket vibrator and i say no it s my chopstick it smells like root beer it s great very lubricating okay well just explore it i know it seems i don t think i will i don t think i m going to come right out and say i don t think i ve ever brought all your men out there and it s and there s no hate on butt play i m just not a player i just i m sure joe would love it and i and you know joe can in his own free time uh explore his prostate okay i m i think i would throw up i m very like i m going through a queasy phase in my sexual world i m going through a queasy phase and a lot of things uh make me sick and that makes sense you got to make sure things are yeah it s interesting it s like every seven years your tastes change and this seventh year for me is like everything yeah i m not trying to stick a finger in a butt on purpose i might slip a digit on accident but it s probably gon na well we won t go okay anyways yes it s true marsupials including the most popular one the kangaroo are equipped with a total of three vaginas and do they all function in the same way or do the tubes lead to the same place tubes what this feels like you know more about vaginas than me now now i m going to google what s the deal with kangaroo this is like this is the slow process i m talking badges like is there a way to type what s the deal with kangaroo badges faster no it s just if chris was here we could continue on chris was here chris would type in something that wouldn t find any results and he would say i can t believe when he can t defend himself we re at war with chris right now no we re not whose side are you on it depends on what you re talking about which war are we fighting uh okay what i so i searched what s the deal with kangaroo oh kangaroo they won t tell me badges i have to spell vagina out and all of a sudden i ve personally lost interest moving to the next spell vagina i hit the talk to text button to say anonymous and she goes what because you can t spell anonymous and i was like yeah maybe A A so it s okay i can t spell anonymous either yeah me either i couldn t even sound it out on a no a n n i don t think there s is there joe was so rude to me the other day i was like how do you spell this thing he goes i don t know sound it out and he was just like so nasty oh it was desantos is that governor de santos in florida and i was like how do you spell that he said d e santos i said maybe i can t sound out santos A A you don t know how to do a lot of things either joe okay s a n t o s you re all dead to me i m walking off this A A show watch i m wrong all the comments are like ryan s wrong it s like it s a silent p and everyone knows it A A simon peace what else is shocking well on that note all poo poo times are pee pee times you ve never A A in a not pissed don t even A A lie in front of the audience and god not all pee pee times are poo poo times though that s pretty good yeah my beat boxing or the no okay um this one i also was like damn girl do not date this woman specifically don t marry her my ex husband was struck by lightning and my current husband was hit with a utility line and set on fire what wow shane s been truly fearing the lightning thing because in the last week there s been like three headlines on the apple news of people being struck dead by lightning jesus and each and every one of them has been a man out with his dog and so we re obviously puppy training and puppy was letting me know uh he had to go potty and it was thunderstorming outside lightning like crazy shane got uh i ll insert the video in he got lightning through our skylights and like the lightning storms here are epic in a way of like visually stunning but they are scary so he like wouldn t let me go out with the dog because now his biggest fear is me being struck by lightning i think that s a rational fear i also agree what s going on i felt like i saw a light outside but i m tripping off the richter so you re also like we walked we got in from our gate and lizzie was like close the gate close the gate what did you think was coming to attack us anything constant vigilance at all

on orders that meet a minimum subtotal terms apply this is my beef with instacart granted i m unreachable yeah i mean if i was sitting outside trying to contact you for minutes after you ordered something knowing something was coming i d be mad that s not my problem i mean that s my problem that s not my problem with the app okay my problem with the app is there s never any clarity between like you are ordering a single produce item or a pound amount so every single time i order something that s like from the produce section the app tells me it s by pound so i couldn t order the sweet potatoes just now like i want five sweet potatoes did they forget them no they only gave me one when i had ordered a pound because they didn t give me the option to order anything that wasn t a A A pound do you have to go to the store no i m gon na make just one A A sweet potato but then the second we should probably go to the store because the set well the second problem is i ll take your card and i ll go to the store okay the second problem is i was like was everything on the list and he goes yeah and i m looking through the bags because i m like an office pa so i m like i should chat because that sounds like a A A front of him of course why wouldn t i he just lied to my face there s no A A chicken in there and that s there s no recipe there s the whole recipe there s no chicken in there he goes they didn t have any chicken i go okay just like they didn t have a pound of yams whatever what did he say i didn t say anything i was like oh where do you have the chicken in your car he went oh no they didn t have any chicken i said oh bummer like but it s always like this so it s like i m always like taking a risk did they not are like because i do doordash yeah and they tell you when they don t have something like they ll text you throughout the process they can text me he did not text me until he was here there were also options like if we don t have this what would you like me to replace it with and i had replacement options in there but a hundred percent of the time my instacart order is wrong really fast yeah yeah okay but keep it in your keep it in your oh shane wait wait wait shane this is coming up there s a reddit form with comments and people are asking wait what was the question okay oh do you wipe when you pee do you wipe your penis when you pee oh uh with a little tissue but only if i m not wearing underwear oh what only if i m not wearing underwear how often are you not wearing underwear right now always we don t wear underwear at the house i would never you re A A wild go pee this is torture you know he s one of the crazy people it s the backup for me this is jane do you like yams he s trying to pee yeah okay have a good pee i just want to know how many yams you have to get later okay we ll head to the store after this lizzie is going to cook for me tonight it will be in her vlog probably this week of yesterday yeah yeah okay so um well should i get into the reddit thing do you want to know more things that shocked me well if you have any i m afraid if i go out of this app it s gon na stop recording interesting that s a good anxiety to have unlocked okay so i was searching on reddit for inspiration and i came across a post that said do you wipe after you pee as a man do you wipe your penis with toilet paper and i thought what a crazy concept wild that shocked you flabbergasted because you ve never wiped your face never oh never i wipe my penis all the time i just i think like there s a very simple like i don t even have to shake by the time i m like pulling it back in yeah it like is pretty much solved and some of the responses were just blowing my mind i feel like there couldn t be that many responses like it s either yes or no responses saying yes or no detailed tips on how to better clean up after yourself let s hear them because you made me ask one of the men i live with as a gentleman myself are you aware of the finger behind your balls trick it s been a game changer for me after pissing put a finger behind your balls scrotum and fill the urethia the urethra tube there squeeze forward and up like a toothpaste tube and the last bit comes out that sounds painful clean undies all day with practice this can be done in public too they re talking about going behind your balls onto your freezing up onto your gooch so like up on the gucci like getting i don t even have a penis and it s making my ears ring and i just didn t know this was such like a hot button topic that so many people are getting i think a lot of men who wear khaki pants have an issue with pee pee drops this person says i just squeeze it out then go wash my hands immediately i also wash my hands before pissing because i want them to be clean when i do this i think that s more of a hot button issue is washing your hands before or after you piss because i d rather have clean hands touching my member than dirty hands touching my member and getting cleaner what are all these guys doing though i don t really need to when you re out in the world you re i flop it out and it s it s supported by my pants and then i pee and i flop it back in like i don t see the problem here this guy says you can tap your dick on the side of the urinal once you re done it works well that s A A up when you wrote me that that s super unhygienic like disease written also again sounds painful awful um someone told me if it needs it so i had her inquire with a man in her life not her husband because he doesn t like being displayed on the internet no that s probably a one in situation i pinch and shake fling that thing around till it s proper they have a lot of different methods apparently as you get older it gets worse like make sense and if you have a baby i m sure it s worse this is for men yeah but don t your penis holes get stretched out after you have a baby kidding what guy s at the same time i have hair in both my eyes this guy said it started in my early s um even one or two drops in my boxers is irritating and this like the the amount of times in which i get a splash on my clothing is almost never but it also sounds like you have an aggressive stream thanks well i don t know if that was a compliment i ll take it as such today s podcast is sponsored by hellofresh and there is nothing worse than working a

for up to free meals and three free gifts hello fresh america s number one meal kit okay okay we did that ngl well i saw honestly chris doing this this morning after school i saw chris doing this this morning and i tipped you off anyway so then i was like well how do you do this so i m in my instagram app for hours looking through every option in the story and then i learn it s a secondary app you have to download which honestly is A A because that s the the whole thing is literally just ask me anything yes but anonymously it s anonymous anyways because you don t know who these A A people are a lot of people do though like if i if i wasn t on the internet it would be my friend submitting the question so like it also feels like it should be someone telling you a secret like i m not gon na lie but i ve seen a lot of wow i ve seen a lot of like people that aren t on the internet doing this and they like post juicy questions that probably people from their high school wanted to ask oh so you can say you don t lie but answer this juicy question well i don t think it s made for like youtubers specifically i think it s made for like everyone who has instagram and then their friends can ask them a question got it without any anonymously okay you understand now i think so you are too much you are too sassy too much how do you deal with hate as a smaller influencer it s so hard whenever i get a hate comment i try not to let it get to me but i can t help but get upset and since you ve started your vlog channel are you dealing with any of this no everybody really likes me you re kidding me no i just told you chris posted hate about me on his A A story talking about strangers and you re trying i mean and for the podcast as well yeah you re the one that reads every single comment i m sure you see them hate you sometimes i definitely see them hating me and i kind of like don t A A care tracy i see you in the comments oh just kidding i don t know anyone s names i wish i would i think it s funny if i act like i know them when i look at them and now i feel bad i pick tracy because i do have a friend named tracy who listens to the pocket okay it s not you tracy it was just the first name that came to my head while i have a hair in my eye um yeah i mean i don t care it s a A A stranger you don t know me and that s what i tried to remember when i first started out it would get to me a lot more or if i made a decision that people didn t like i would take it to heart but the thing is you just have to live your life yeah and shut off from people s reactions because if i live my life based on people s reactions to me i would become so you can t do a shell of a person i wouldn t be able to create on the internet i mean you wouldn t be able to do anything really without the fear of being well what the what does it so and so think who gives a A A with you it becomes exhausting i ve been there in like a small regard being like oh well if i do this they re definitely gon na be mad at me or if this then that s gon na spark this reaction and at one point i just like after everything that had happened like in the past few years i m just like i m going to be me yeah and if they don t want to watch me that s fine see ya then you there s another channel and if you want to be mad at me that s also fine like if you want to get worked up over me unless unless i m i will say though with all of that if there is a genuine con or like a general consensus that i ve done something wrong wrong yeah that s that is like then i m like okay this is a recurring theme and maybe i should look in the mirror and reflect about this yeah and say something if i need to yeah i m down to be wrong but like for someone coming into the comments just to say something nasty about me that is specifically like i can t A A stand that lizzy girl it s like okay dude i don t i don t come to your work and leave a review on your web page saying i can t A A stand you i mean maybe people do do that yep google reviews people do do that yeah i guess but i don t think that s good either like i think that s crazy and i m a person who leaves exclusively negative yelp reviews if it s honestly if it s affecting you that much you can censor words so just do that i mean they can what like on youtube or on instagram you can say oh like hide this i would say just don t look but if you can t help yourself from not looking then i think the healthiest move is to like censor a word that you can t take for yourself yeah yeah i have my comments restricted on my instagram so that people who don t follow me can t comment so if you really want to drop some nasty A A on my instagram that i m also not going to see because i don t know how to read my comments wow i don t because it s like i m not there s certain points where people come in and just say like nasty A A and it s just like why would you come here to do that you know i feel like people are the meanest on instagram i mean yeah it s also like i m not the one because like i you see me trying to operate my phone i don t A A know how it s a miracle i know how to read youtube comments you know what i mean like i literally do not know how to work my phone okay well this person wants to know lizzy are you in a thrill and a throuple with your roommate god i love that question why because it makes me feel like a bad A A like i ve got like two mans you know they re fighting over you we ll know that they that are submissive to me because i m sick uh no i m not in a throttle james is very single and available and joe never feels threatened by i don t know what he would feel threatened by i mean i know i m just saying i m not i m not i know i m saying i don t know what he was saying like two straight men in a house it s like an award i think more than anything the power dynamic of the houses i sometimes am like don t forget that i m your primary partner joe i am your wife not james is not your husband i am your wife you know what i mean all right okay i understand the bromance is strong the relationship on your end would be some of the like hey i need to check you for this yeah okay um least favorite thing about each other us yeah should we do it anonymously we can t because we know it s us you re singing straight up i m leaving i will hang up the phone if you re not i m not gon na leave when she starts singing i m like sometimes honestly you have a way of chewing and swallowing that is different from other people cut to you eating that freeze drink i don t give a A A i m eating a freeze dried candy but you can eat a silent snack i could hear it you can eat a A A scrambled egg that everybody in the entire world can eat quietly and you re not even it s not like you smack it s not even a smacky thing your mouth is shut and you re chewing like every other human being choose but you re making a crazy sound interesting and it s wild i noticed this when we had to do that emergency podcast episode where i came over the day up and you posted at the dave and i remember i made his egg test oh right and i was sitting there like you might have just been tired and honest no i was like maybe shane doesn t have that thing like maybe it s ryland like maybe the problem s riley that was the thought i had oh i will not be attacked for this but i will say when you were drinking when you were eating that freeze dried candy yeah it s loud it was crazy yeah i m not i won t take that personally okay then i won t take mine personally either well you should well you could just you didn t say anything and there s nothing you can do to help we could have just turned on music i don t think would have helped because i would have still been there like wow because it s all i can think about and honestly it is enraging but it s not it s not personal you can t help it but it was crazy i will not be eating your dinner tonight what oh he s ordering food thank you chicken spinach okay um i thought he was coming out because he was gon na sacrifice he was gon na A A slay you for your chewing i m glad he didn t hear that oh really i didn t want another person attacking me because it would have been in your favor of course it would have and it would have been nice to have someone on my side because you forget i m the victim on this podcast oh please how often do you are no chris is the A A victim on this podcast i took off the more aggressive one that included more than this yeah but i just thought it was interesting yeah i think like three times a week four nice you that s private um do you have anything about this what s your favorite part of doing a podcast together oh it s everything s my favorite part i think it s super funny when i like i m out in the real world and i m like oh i have to go to work lizzie uses it as an ex whoa lizzy uses it as an excuse for everything if she has oh my boss is calling it s you oh i have to take this call it s my boss i can t be there i have to travel for work i pick up leslie it s literally like i m like you come any day you want she s like can t do anything with everyone else got ta work got ta try to work i ve got ta fly ugh i m going to colorado for a day and i have to walk a mile to the airport so see you later everything about this is so A A fun literally everything about this is so fun okay uh what s your advice for life after college i m graduating next spring and have no idea what i want for your career yet so i feel all the pressure to go straight into the workforce as soon as i graduate i mean that s not really in your hands what do you mean i think there s a lot of pressure on kids to get jobs right out of college but like getting a job is not in your hands it has to do with what s available to you and it has to do with who s hiring and like there s a lot of things that you can t control so putting so much pressure on yourself to achieve it is not really realistic and it s similar to how i felt about going to college i felt like the pressure upon me to go to college was more than i actually wanted to immediately go to college so if you have the funds to really figure out what you want to do that s great if not and you have to work a fun job until you find where you re going to work that s great too like even if you have to work a brutal job that s not fun hey you got a paycheck but even my serving jobs that were brutal and not fun sometimes you find it very fun like it s when looking back like they were some of the most fun years of my life had i known that they were going to end i probably would have had more fun yeah but uh they were very fun yeah i think you can do everything within your power to be employable and to make opportunities for yourself but no matter what putting the pressure on yourself to make somebody else hire you is like when i say it out loud it even sounds crazy to me yeah and i used to have panic attacks when i was graduating college and applying for jobs i would read the requirements for position for positions and i was like i don t have a single skill set like there s not one goddamn thing i can do on this A A checklist of A A i can i can t do any i m unemployable i would just and facts are i am unemployable this is the only job i could do i would just start planting seeds in what you love to do and i would start going in the direction of how you would like to live your life because i think a lot of you force yourself into what you want to be yeah and for a long time i was working awful jobs while i was trying to like be fun employed is what lizzie and i would always call it we d always be like we just want to see my full time friend what we want to do so i would say like whatever piques your interest try to get your foot in even if it s an internship even if it s for free even if it s assisting someone yeah and work your way up the door instead of stressing out about like getting this job out the gate because if you love what you do you re going to be great at what you do and you re going to excel up the ladder fast absolutely amen take the pressure off what you can t control my boyfriend drinks every weekend when he s off and it bugs me so much it s starting to affect our relationship he has depression and i ve never had to deal with something like this how do i handle it without losing him we just moved in after being together for eight years like am i just boring help i mean i don t think it has anything to do with you and again you re talking about changing another thing that s outside of your control but when you re living with the thing outside of your control after being with somebody for eight years it would feel like a seismic shift because had he not been drinking before you moved in now you moved in with someone you thought you knew who doesn t isn t that person you recognize yeah i think you re saying he s dealing with depression the alcohol is gon na make him more depressed because alcohol is a depressant right and you can t stop him from drinking and you can t make him want to make himself well but you can ask him what s at the bottom yeah and you feel making way he s feeling you can make him want to gravitate towards a drink absolutely and you can say like i love you so much that it pains me to watch you do something like this to yourself and at a certain point if you re no longer fulfilled in your relationship because he s prioritizing drinking and getting drunk rather than like having a night experiencing the the life he s built with you i think you re gon na have to eventually give him an ultimatum if he doesn t want to explore the core of what s going on beneath the drinking yeah and maybe seek professional help himself yeah because you can lead a horse to water and you can t make him drink and you will waste a lot of your A A time trying to make a person drink yeah and it s just except that you can not do anything about it and make it about yourself what do you want what do you need how can you articulate to your partner those things and i would give him some time i wouldn t leave yeah no no i m not even talking about like leaving but i am saying like speak your piece like honey i love you you re acting in a way that concerns me as a person who loves you can we talk about this do you want to change it or if you don t want to talk about it and you don t want to change it here s here s my boundaries yeah a lot of people were asking about the wedding situation and if we re going to get married before we have a kid because we keep expanding our family but we re not married um it s just not like the highest to do list it s not like the high priority yeah i still want to like throw you a wedding like i want to have a meeting with you guys where we sit down you tell me what you want you give me a budget and you show up and it s fair and even if what you want is not me there that s sounding more and more wonderful as time goes on just because neither of us are prioritizing a wedding because we feel so married already like we re already like as married as married and you re not party people and no we re not party people so like i do feel like we probably will get married before we have a child even if it s not a big event maybe we ll like do a commitment ceremony with each other and then maybe throw the wedding later on when we re both feeling more festive i don t know if you ll ever feel like we wan na weddings are weird they re hard and annoying yeah so but we are we just consider us married get over it we re married uh tips on working to quit vaping cold turkey doesn t work for me so far i ve just been working on lowing lowering my nicotine count i figured lizzy could give advice since she quit smoking i mean i was hypnotized but you were ready and i wanted to quit and so for me it s the coming to the realization that nicotine like tobacco products will kill me not if when do i want to deal with dying from that the way that that death results no do i honestly believe that if i m gon na sit calmly and smoke a cigarette no i don t honestly believe my life is being threatened if i there s a gun to my head my life is being threatened i m gon na have a different response to that my response is to get the A A gun away from my head so you have to envision cigarettes like a gun to your head you have to envision cigarettes like a child playing with a grenade are you gon na sit in a room and say i ll take that grenade from that child on monday or are you going to urgently take the grenade out of the child s hands yeah so you have to see yourself as a child you have to see the cigarette as a grenade and when you think about using any kind of nicotine or tobacco product you have to see it as a literal threat and assault on you and what i do when i see that now like the way that my brain strain is like oh i want a cigarette it s like A A that someone s trying to kill me yeah no i m laughing but because it s real it s like get the A A out of here like that s my i do like a whole physical thing where i m like A A you that s my response to the thought i m so glad that you ve stuck with it you re it s been a long time now yeah so i hope you can get there too and if you absolutely can not i think the try the try the meditation the guided meditation tapes from carrie gainer yeah i think even if you don t live in california where he is he has online resources to try i don t know how expensive they are but if it s a last resort thing it might be like the expense is worth it when you think about how much you re spending on vapes and cartridges and investments in living yeah so i i mean it s a good option you can make it a one time purchase instead of a weekly daily monthly allowance for tobacco products i put this one in here because lizzy had a pretty funny live reaction and it was have you ever licked a booty hole and i was like well yeah of course and lizzy said isn t it sometimes like always hairy like isn t that a bummer well i think it s sometimes like uh giving head like when you first i think that like when you first start giving head sometimes aren t you like not but then like a minute in you like start really getting into it well no i mean like for me it s like how i feel about having hair in my eyeballs right now like a lot of hair in my mouth is a bummer and i think about that like all the time so what if it was like waxed bleached and clean that s that s a butthole okay i have butthole things though like i m not into buttholes right does size matter yeah in what regard if i if a person can not feel your penis it s a bummer wow and i think everybody s going to take the opposite report approach where if it s like too big is how oh there s both so if you can t feel a dick it s a bummer if the dick doesn t fit that s a bummer and that s like a size matter breaker yeah if it s too big and it pains the woman or the man it s like how are you ever matters if you ve got a coke hand dick it s an it s a hard pass you know what i mean over time though it would be acclimated like you re already into engaging every time you re like working up a half an hour to me you better be real funny it s super nice thoughts on cannibal this isn t my words this is theirs cannibal army hammer and him apparently working at a hotel now yeah dude s not a cannibal and if he is working at a hotel A A good for that guy for having a job and making a A A honest income and he has kids to support yeah it s like i don t think we should be publicly shaming a person for having a job are you kidding because he was once in movies and we ll probably and then he comes from like a mega rich family so this guy s not taking money from his family maybe they cut him off because he had a drug problem and he hit rock bottom and now he s a worker among workers and trying to work his way back up i don t know i honestly don t know so i can t speak directly for army hammer but i can speak to the people who are shaming a man who has a job that s A A wild to me and taking pleasure in shaming somebody for having a job is what s more sick to me and regardless of his past or what you think of the person it s like if they have kids and they if even if they don t have kids if they have to support themselves yeah why are we making a mockery of a person yeah and having a job yeah and not to be like hella supportive of army hammer but like the guy s sick he s got a disease i don t remember that like he s an alcoholic or he s clearly a drug addict the stuff that he was posting online is not indicative of a person who s making and coherent choices and if he s holding a job like this hopefully that s a sign that he s sober and doing well and i think like the mental impact on a person when there s non stop articles shaming you for where you re at in life let him recover life is unpredictable all of us could be up and down and down and up at any time yeah just be thankful for where you re at right now and drive the next day but that A A is long oh is that like life busts quick but she s like long is there a way to make that thing no it s okay it doesn t have to be okay our last question is i want to leave my boyfriend of eight years do it do it do it because dump his ass say bye say you know what sit him down here s the deal i m breaking up with you and i m not going to talk to you for a long time you know that it s not like that easy we re being crazy because we ve been recording for a long time no but do it you have to i mean if you know where you are oh i m sore in my chest and if you re not growing with him if you don t see a potential to grow with him then you you got ta evolve in your life i mean the fact that you just said i want to break up with my boyfriend like you do it i don t you don t need a reason beyond that get out get out right now i ll tell them this is the end of you and them i wish i could go back in time and put A A goggles on before i stepped in this house jesus christ i can t see anymore you know how uno got his eyeball scratched living here that s it that s all he had to do from himself from him his own fur it s his own damn fur okay do we need to break down or should we do some advice let s do some advice though hold on i was like trying to crack my head all right let s get into some advice all right we have some callers on this day on this fine sunday it s a sunday before a monday that i ve been seeing for the last little over a year about six months into us talking with each other i stepped out of the relationship in a way um i had sent some explicit photos to a guy um and those photos have got sent over to my dude that i m seeing and it has caused so much problems between us because he s convinced that i slept with this guy i m very adamant that i did not because i didn t so he s trying to have me jump through all these scoops and do some pretty drastic things to get back in his good graces but he s still very standoffish with me um i just wanted to know if you guys think that it is a possibility to make it work with someone when there has been infidelity but not physical instability like i said it was just a photo i was drunk it was just a one time thing um so i don t know if you guys think it would work if you don t think it would work i d love to hear your input but yeah other than that i love you guys ryland um you and shane are literally like my favorite couple on social media right now uh y all are literally the cutest and lizzy um you are fantastic i love you so stop being you uh thank you guys bye bye wow um yeah well i think first of all you do have to meet him where he s at and he does have the upper hand and he knows it i mean i know his feelings are hurt but he does you kind of have to meet him where he s at because you did the thing that hurt his feelings but he also has to decide that he s going to and willing to forgive you and that s what i mean meeting him where he s at and having an honest conversation and that is so i know what i did hurt you is there moving past this for you and is it worth us coming to is our relationship worth it to you do you want to stick this out do you want to try to keep moving forward i think if it was like i don t know how serious were you guys to begin with if you re sending photos to somebody else i know you said that you were drunk and it was a mistake it also kind of seems as though like if it got directly back to your guy was this guy that you were sending things to like like baiting you to this question you could because it is very odd that the guy you were sending like is the guy that you were sending photos to like his homie like one of his best friends otherwise why would he directly find it yeah and also why were you checked out are you like and why did you check back in like how long are you willing to stay and wait for your mans to heal and i i guess yeah that s a good question and i know that that sounds insensitive but i do think that when you re dating check in to why you checked out because if you re going to make a choice like that it is kind of like what we were talking about in the car earlier today like about making choices based around what you feel you want to back up like i want to act the way i want to be responsible held responsible for i don t want to do things that cause shame for me or put me in a position where i have to feel the need to apologize because that s always uncomfortable and scary for me so in order to avoid those negative feelings and that anxiety i choose to act in a way that does not require a follow up of that sort so when i do find myself in a position to make an apology it s because i ve made a mistake yeah so i guess also asking yourself how much of getting him back is like a chase for you do you know what i mean yeah because sometimes that s more exciting like trying to win him back over i know this sounds really bad exciting isn t the right word it s like it s it s it s a it it feels like the appropriate thing for a person to do when they ve done something wrong right so like i will make amends for this by making it up to you by fixing our relationship but is this a relationship you would like to face yeah so if he accepts your apology today and says i m ready to put this behind us let s move forward and build a relationship stronger and better than ever is that something you actually want and i think that s something you have to ask yourself if you did this in the first place but i think meeting him where he s at asking him what he really wants from you and trying to find a middle ground if you want to move forward in this relationship and choose how long you guys are willing to work at it because there is a point where it becomes an insufferable burden on both of you like i can t stand being mad at you and i can t stand having you be mad at me i can t be punished daily if you can t get over it i don t want to live in constant punishment for something that i can not undo because i did it yeah and that s the sad fact you can not undo cheating you can not undo it yeah even if it s not physical even if there s no A A it s the act of betrayal and i think if i m stepping in his shoes it s the fear of what else or how could you take it further even if it was a mistake you know what i mean and it already sounds like he has you jumping through some hoops because you said he s making you do kind of like a laundry list of A A to prove your loyalty to him and that already to me doesn t sound good and he s probably trying to make himself feel more valid in the relationship but i agree with you the to do list is like well it s like eith you got to forgive somebody or not you trust someone or you don t if the trust is broken and shattered beyond repair and you re not willing to fix it without an external band aid by the other person then you don t trust that person yeah so i think a brutally honest conversation and i think andy you know be kind because you you you A A up and it s okay to A A up you can A A up but did you A A up because of a landmine that s about to A A explode inside you that you don t want to be in this relationship yeah my biggest question is do you really want to be with him because i was in a relationship in college and i cheated all the A A time and i was like i swear this is the last time you know what i mean like i i m gon na marry this guy and everyone kept being like i don t know man you re cheating on him all the time and in my mind i was like no no no no i this is what i want and then it s like when i look you know you were cheating on him oh yeah and he s cheating on me all over the place okay and it was like super volatile and not cool and then both of us would be like i love you you are my person we shall be wed and then like one year i just sort of was coming up with even more extreme excuses for the relationship to not work out like i was gon na go to school in in oslo norway and i think my dad was like why don t you just break up with this guy seems like an easier i was like i don t want to break up with him and then i was like um and that s what i mean sometimes when you re entangled in something it s like well are you just are you just going why are you trying to make this work or is it just what is that just presented in front of you and feels like the path you have to walk down you re on it and it s also like comfort in a relationship is a real son of a A A and you can get comfortable in toxic patterns as well like you can get comfortable in a fight and forgiveness pattern you can get comfortable and i will be victorious and make this work even though everyone tells me it won t no matter what it is this is your path and you are in control of your actions and your decisions and where you want it to lead but you got to be sure you know where you what your motivation is amen hi ryland hi lizzy so i had a little bit of a dilemma i haven t seen this guy but we re not really dating we re just kind of hanging out a lot lately and having sex i m a regular but it s getting to a point where i m like seeing him every single day and he calls me every single day to come see me and you know to me i feel like this is more of a A A situation but then when i try to leave his house at like let s say five o clock in the morning after we watch movies or whatever he doesn t want me to leave should i bring up that i don t want a relationship or should i just leave at these thanks bye why am i smiling like they re in love like why does it feel like this is the beginning of a love story i do feel like they re meant for each other yeah and like the timing isn t right yeah but i think that s based off of no details yes no i know this isn t like get married no i do think this is like blissfully cute but i don t if you re not ready to meet him where he s at i do think you need to have the conversation with him because this is the dirtiest A A well not dirtiest but i mean like the the line is so blurred in terms of what a A A buddy and relationship with them i feel like with A A buddies after you meet a certain threshold of like getting comfortable having sex frequently because i know like in my early s i wanted to hook up with somebody constantly but i didn t want a relationship and instead of like searching for a stranger that wasn t safe it s like oh if i feel comfortable with you this is great no strings attached but i feel like what always ends up happening is one person catches starts developing more feelings than the other and i just feel like like i said in the last question you have to meet somebody where they re at and you can t drag them along for too long because you can t if they re looking for a long term serious relationship it s just well it s like they might not even know that they re looking for a long term serious relationship but it sounds like they like you more than a A A buddy and if you re hanging out that frequently and talking daily you re in a relationship that s what kind of drives me crazy because i would have this with men a lot where it would be like everything s everything on this checks a relationship box except for your willingness to call it such interesting you re going to spend every day with me you re only having sex with me nobody else we talk all the time and i think timing s everything though because i in my early s i and it was an internal thing where i felt i didn t have something to offer someone else because i hadn t achieved a level of stability in my life like i felt like everything was in flux i was working three jobs i just wasn t where i needed to be in order to give myself to someone else and so it wouldn t have been i mean there was i hurt a couple of guys feelings because i did like them and had i been maybe we could have been in a relationship but i just i wasn t there i couldn t meet them there and so i think telling this person where you re at especially if you re spending that much time i know it can be hard especially if you guys are having fun but maybe he is down to keep going for a while or maybe he s not but there will be if you re just looking to have sex there s going to be somebody else to have sex with also you might surprise yourself you might tell him all this and he s like yummy too yeah honestly maybe yeah dudes are weird like that honestly A A weirdos that s why lizzy s a lesbian oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh that s so rude but i definitely think you should tell him i m glad you guys are having fun and a small part of me thinks that you honestly love him too this is yeah we re this is us not even knowing your name we re like get married well yeah all right you guys well i hope you enjoyed today s episode of the sip what are you doing i m ending the show and then i m gon na insert the what do you mean what

excuse me my friend shannon s texting me no get out of here get out of here i m focusing yeah turn that thing on okay chris what was your slate gon na say i didn t have anything in mind you can t think of anything what the A A i ve got to take out some anger on both of you okay all day traveling to my house and i just can t stand either of you i m not kidding i m kidding i m so glad you guys are here i ve missed you so much i missed doing the podcast almost honestly almost honestly this A A guy man this A A guy it s not my fault it was canceled coveted queen we should i m sorry i m like i had too much caffeine i chugged a lot cove it is no joking man you guys it s do you see how windy it is outside are we legit about to be in the middle of a A A tornado it might make things interesting as long as we don t lose power the drama now that she s a vlogger she understands that you need drama that s not my vlog s vibe well i m not and i don t mean like drama amongst other people lizzy s making anything drama like what were you saying this morning when i got to the airport today i said should i just not come for the drama and i was like that would what i didn t get the drama it s all about how you frame it baby so how was your flight in did you guys miss me very much lizzy texts me a lot but sometimes it s overbearing so i just have to i never hear from him he doesn t respond yesterday i was like wow i ve sent him a lot of messages but i ve got more to say and i do feel very detached from the world here in a weird way like i haven t kept up on any like because a lot of times on this podcast we do cover like hot topics yeah i don t know anything that s going on i have been living in my own little world honestly that might be for the best and i think i might have just been bored when i was living in california not that like because you were really one of my only friends that i like hung out with frequently and i didn t have family there so i d be like oh well like we would talk a little bit more because i was doing less and now when i m doing so much it s hard to like be constantly on my phone i feel i don t know it s weird i get it because i ve been vlogging on my phone so whenever you text me i can t respond i know that s why i ve got to get you on a vlog camera and you know what thank you so much for the vlog camera you re welcome i will learn to use it i ll text her right now and she ll be like i can t talk i m on my vlog camera stop texting why don t you just put it in do not disturb when you re vlogging it doesn t work like that no i don t know how that works i don t i don t know how we re gon na move on yes you do because every time i go to text you it s like user what does it say no if that s insulting it says do not disturb A A because i m busy but the thing is it doesn t work if my phone is open i don t think because when my phone s open if it s on work mode i still get the notification i hate work mode i m just going to come out and say it oh damn he s needy today are you not getting enough attention here do you need to see your mom probably too much attention that s why i m like disconnected from the world which is also why i think i get a lot of comments sorry i m talking a lot yeah there s like people on my vlogs will say you guys are so much happier in colorado and i think it s just there s a lot more going on that s more stimulating we are around family and that s why yeah like even when you guys were flying in today i was like what are we gon na talk about i don t know anything that s going on in the world i ve just been trying to garden did you notice my flowers when you came in no i ll let you talk now i did not notice your flowers i m so insulted i know i m so sorry like how did they not hit you in the face with beauty i think i was like distracted because i was a little bit perturbed by the guy that drove us here oh he was like do i turn here i was like we don t know dude this is a foreign space to us are you A A you just picked us up from the airport we don t A A live here nobody can find this house yeah he was like do i turn here i was like sure Laughter what does the gps on your phone say you have two phones open with gps maps on them have you looked at either something i thought was interesting was i forgot so we had booked chris a day early from when we re about to shoot shane s podcast and i didn t ask you at the time because you were really going through a lot so i was like i ll ask her later if she s going to join our podcast excursion because i didn t want to like overwhelm you and so yesterday i was like i guess i should confirm with chris that he s okay to film the sip because i never told him oh really and i say hey chris can we film the sift tomorrow because lizzy s on your flight so we re going to he knew i was on the flight i texted him because i had to figure out what the flight was because you just sent me a picture with no airline on it just a time i didn t book chris s flight it was the best i could do i know you said that already also and i was able to figure it out because i booked many a southwest flight so lizzy lost chris at the airport this morning well you found him first no so i found chris in the security line but he didn t see me i was behind him so i just went and then he looked over at me and i went A A you it was really funny and then i was like let me cut because i was well behind him like you know how it wraps around you can t cut you know we re A A married you do not know how we re boyfriend girlfriend of course they can come with him they don t know that i wasn t just his spouse in the A A bathroom you re like my ring this is my man yeah and i like and then he like looks at the woman he goes see me and she cuts it s like shut the A A up chris you just need to roll with the punches i m your wife who was in the potty and the fact that you had no loyal to me the fact that you had no loyalty to me in that moment hurts was sickening and then when i agree with you chris what because yes we went to the rockies fireworks game it was fabulous like the fourth of july i guess it begs to come please let me come for the fourth of july he said no you re right it s my mom s birthday and she hates you which i know is a lie vicky loves me no she she had coveted so she wanted to schedule the podcast blame it on the cove well no you were like act like you re you re just not down with kovid she said can i come and we ll film a podcast on the weekend before the fourth and i was like you re crazy i m not filming on the holiday weekend i want to relax i said on the fourth i said i ll fly in and fly out on the farm and i said i m not doing the weekend either because it s my mom s birthday so we re not recording i didn t say if you wanted to come hang out with me i did i begged i said can i come hang out she s lying no pull out the text space you re the victim on this podcast i m the victim on shane s podcast whatever um okay a few interesting things now that i m looking at our text messages lizzy sent me that there s like ball attachments for the back actually my baby mama haley sent me the ball attachments haley s all about croc attachments which i think is funny because i don t even think she has a pair of crocs but she got me spurs for the back of mine which are so funny you don t ask for an asset i lost my crocs i can t get you a picture i m so sorry i m sure if we scroll up and i bought you those cards i know i haven t told you yet but i lost them months ago and it s A A devastating that s why i ve been looking at crocs today on prime day it s because lizzy s like we should shop on prime day and i was like okay but uh holy A A that s just something i saw interesting that she texted me that i never replied to so there s ball attachments to the croc i ll show it in the video attachments for the crocs just for clarity it s they re not balls they re like they re balls they re testicular balls and people get that on like hanging on their cars yeah you re not as good on a car but a scrotum croc charm kind of everything kind of hits the vibe should we get crocs if you put those scrotums on the back of your balenciagas it would be such a vibe i ll do that for sure and we re all of us in amazon prime girls so lizzy says i found chris then stopped to buy headphones and now he s missing yeah and i said don t worry about him he s probably jacking off in the bathroom no and i had already texted chris where are you and he said the bathroom and i said well chris i ve seen the shane dawson podcast and i can t help but imagine you re jacking off in there right now so if you haven t yet tuned into the shane dawson podcast which i m sure you have last week uh chris told us about all the sorts of places he does that kind of thing and this week chris told me that telling you guys that is his biggest nightmare and he doesn t want to talk about it so maybe we shouldn t oh we can pivot we can pivot well did you release yourself in the back in the airport bathroom no i didn t i was so terrified that everyone thinks i m going to do that every time in a bathroom now why did i say that i didn t know you were setting up lights downstairs and i heard the bathroom fan on and so i said lizzy is he not setting up cause he s jerking off and she said dude i don t know probably and then i go downstairs to get the light and he was down there so i was like phew and then chris goes like well i m gon na bring it up because i need to like i need to address the situation i was like you don t want to address the situation because then you re doubling down there s nothing wrong with it i pee outside of this house every day i m one second away from jacking off outside of the house jesus here s here s yeah it s nobody s A A business where are you or how fast but i made it everyone you you did do that so it s like it doesn t become their business because you told them that you don t need to talk you know and don t become a victim to your own story because then they ll pry on you that s how the world works pray on you pray on you yeah i want to cry and never speak again okay bye would jacking off help with that feeling no do you need to excuse yourself you got ta go beat the meat do it right here i don t even mind honestly have you thought about an only fans no i hate my body lean into the brand lean into it okay so how has your life been i heard there s a new copa variant going around okay i don t i m not a coveted A A connoisseur just because i had the disease okay well tell me how it was for you how was it it was you know kind of lame it was like a bummer well you said like you were very physically ill um yeah i was ill that was okay this is a great job i was sick and i was not okay i should keep telling stories check out the vlog every tuesday where it s where it s this good um okay maybe you ll have more excitement about this to celebrate your vlog yeah i was setting you up oh for my melting pot story i m so sorry brain fog are you a long hauler apparently okay all i know is covered now uh okay weird because you can t talk about it you didn t even know what kind of variant you had what how do you know no one knows i heard there was a bee something very yeah i m sure there s always been a bunch of A A variants but it s not like i m taking a test that says like you ve scored this on the variant exposure i know and we re joking you have i know it s all i can feel but i haven t been able to grab it and we don t really mean to joke about this i know it is very serious no it s so serious it really is no it really is really we re just we re not in the headspace like i m sorry i ve had a A A ton of sugar and i hate my life yeah oh my god okay do you want me to get into the drama no do you want to talk about the melting pot or not i promised joe i would A A the melting pot on the podcast you would A A at the melting pot no no so dark i could A A at the melting pot no one to know but i promised joe after our experience that i would A A them i can picture joe pic jacking off in some weird places me too okay anyways joe no joe s a normal jacker offer he s gon na he hates me he s like this is he doesn t want his face on the vlog he doesn t want anything that s the most horrifying part okay let s start at the beginning so the very beginning it was april san francisco you re awarded a kaiser are you judging you A A judge me i have kaiser you have kaiser okay trash anyways yeah they re when i tried getting tested for coven with kaiser they re like we get you in two weeks i m like after it s over you want me to infect all of the usa and then you ll tell me if i had coveted or not thanks a lot kaiser that s kaiser um not sponsored so my premium s great though Laughter you re ever able to use it literally never i caught them and i m like okay i need a specialist because i really am having this issue and they re like well to see a specialist you have to see five doctors that can recommend you to that specialist i m like i don t got that time kind of time i m just gon na die to see a specialist you have to wait until the moon is in the second house and jupiter aligns with mars honestly then peace will guide the planets it s no wonder they happen and love will steal the stars okay mommy this is the dawn focus i hate what i m saying so sorry i haven t if you want to sing sing on your vlog i do if you were if you would watch you fake ass fan anyways back to me so i m vlogging now chris tell me when the story is over Laughter anyways i m going to check in with some people listen my husband wanted to surprise me by to celebrate the vlog because it has been going very well for me it really has it really has joe read it he s like these people like did you pay for these comments and i was like i no like i think these people like like me i m so proud because i did tell lizzy when she started i was like you just have to know this is your own venture you have to like brace yourself for to build up and it s like i thought i was thinking like oh if you can get die hards on your vlog you re like cruising yeah and you re killing it i m and honestly i m really i this isn t part of my story but i was like i did want to say like it s a really scary thing to do you have to put yourself up and i feel really stupid because i m an insecure person so it s really hard to do that and i had filmed multiple vlogs before which you know like i ve probably shown you over the years a bunch where i m like never mind i m not i m not gon na post this fully edited vlogs like i m just like this isn t nobody s business i can t show this to anyone um and then it s like you get really scared you know what i mean like i watch how hard you and shane work and i wa and i like you know i like a lot of youtubers and i watch a lot of them burn out and have a really hard time with it and it becomes sort of this toxic thing if it s like every you hear like the toxic hamster wheel or whatever and so like going into it like i was A A scared you also don t want to fail i mean it s yeah well i was positive i was gon na fail and failing is subjective but i just mean like no if you re going to display yourself yeah and then have up and downs for every creator but i m just saying it s like it is a scary thing to put yourself out there and then you think like oh everyone from my high school is going to see this and all of a sudden you re like oh wait A A you re and you think this is the year to start vlogging well because there is a threshold right it s like you before you really have people watching i guess it is you re initially asking the yeah the people who you grew up with or the people who are going to be like this A A thinks she can be a vlogger exactly and so it is over hurdle it s like coming over the hurdle of your uh immediate circle of acquaintances being like they re gon na watch this so that s hard to do too and then it s just like how do i i don t like i don t know how to talk to the camera like i every time i m trying to be on your vlog i m like just don t do this to me just turn it away turn it away from me they don t no one needs to know and so it s like i just decide like i had this epiphany because i was so sad that i didn t have the energy to be anything but super authentic i was like well i i got ta do it this way because i can t do anything else like i can t i can t pretend to be okay or anything else right now so then i realized like oh wait i can A A use this as like a really healthy outlet for me in a time when all i want to do is like rot in my own bed and filth so i ve been actually like really liking it because it actually like i m not getting ready for it but i am getting out of bed yeah and i think that s really positive and it s fun to have something to creatively work on yeah because vlogging is fun in that sense where you re creating you re it s just like an interesting craft yeah and i like using it as like a healthy push to do things that i wouldn t otherwise do and so i m i m really liking it in that sense and i think my goal is just to keep it really healthy and really positive for myself but joe wanted to celebrate the whole doing of it thing so he and i ve been non stop talking about fondue because i ve A A love what you can so i m like the only i ve been googling it forever and like joe and i are going to vegas eventually and i keep being like can we get fun doing vegas like when can we get fondue so i found the melting pot which is actually close to where you used to live in thousand oaks oh okay so we got it well we go i know but we go well past your exit but you re on the way right um and so we got minutes past me but whatever whatever it s not even close to your house i ll always ask lizzy like oh did you go to this movie theater she s like it was right by you i m like that s like so far away from where i am i m at your house it s like no you re not that s why i have your location because i m a liar or a fool so joe i call the melting pot to go on like a friday night like last minute after i went rock climbing because i wanted to like celebrate that myself and they re like oh we re not taking any more reservations like they re packed and like the hottest club in thousand oaks so joe i told you like never mind they won t take us let s just go to tequila s instead he didn t do something crazy no he made a reservation at tequila at tiles he made a reservation at the melting pot without telling me and he like wrote that he like made it a special reservation too where he s like we re celebrating my wife like we re doing all this like thank you so A A cute we get there there s nobody there it s dead they lead us through a labyrinth of darkness in a shitty smelling environment where you physically can not see around the corners to the degree of which everyone is screaming corners corners corners as they lead you into a back A A booth that kind of looks like an old school train compartment with no windows and it stinks it stinks like weird A A and cleaning supplies like this is not the vibe and it s so A A dark but like not in a good way and there s no music can i tell you something you knew it was awful well no i i have no interest in going to the melting pot but when you do go to vegas there is a restaurant in pitch a pitch black dining experience well that s something you sign up for yes i know the melting pot isn t that but do that when you re in vegas it s very fun it sounds like something i d hate i thought i like to look at every bite i like i like curate every bite but then you have to use you have to use your senses in a way that you don t typically do so it actually becomes a very enjoyable experience but back to the melting point i ll consider it it s very fun so then we get to the melting pot we re sitting down this guy comes to help us i m still excited even though it s a weird A A vibe and they their menu is like you can either get this for two or that for two people and it s like and i honestly just wanted to get all the cheeses but there s only one there s room for one pot so you can only do uh cheese so the dinner menu like dictates you get a cheese then you get a broth then you get a A A oh you get a salad awful dude it was so gross and it was and it was so bad it was so A A bad i can t like i was like choking it down joe s like dude i m sorry this is gross right and i was like yeah it s pretty gross and we even asked so this and then the server goes are you guys celebrating anything and joe goes yeah we are i wrote a A A essay on what we re celebrating and the guy leaves and that s how i know joe like did all this effort because he s like just so you know dude like i wrote to them this is a big celebration i was thinking they were gon na make a bigger deal about it like i thought they were gon na bring like a cake out with chocolate that says congratulations at the very least know about something you know what i mean right so that got thrown out the window and then i asked the server i was like do you just love fondue and he goes uh not not working here says that to us well we re spending not working here i thought this is gon na go a different way no i you said you couldn t get a reservation i thought joe is gon na call or you were gon na call and say but i m a famous youtuber no i m not that bold so basically the bottom line was it was A A awful and it was so gross we couldn t even eat the food and then when we left it was and you re still hungry didn t eat a A A thing we had craft macaroni and cheese at home so i had to come on here and warn everyone if you have delusions of the melting pot being a fantastic we dressed up we A A dressed up i was dressed the A A up like full face of makeup body glitter i had body glitter on and i was and it s like we needed this you know what i mean we ve been at home crying for weeks like we really needed a nice night this is the first night by the way we ve been out in at least nine months oh no that s not true we went out we went out okay and so for a man that supports you yeah he doesn t want to be seen by you no he doesn t want to be in the vlog he doesn t want his face in the vlog so he s like constantly calling me like you need to post a short on youtube how does he even know what that is i don t A A know but he knows so much A A he s like you need to stop swearing in your vlogs and i was like are you sure because i swear all over the podcast he s like you should probably stop doing that too so he s like i love that he s like we need to maximize yeah the potential here yeah him and you need to do shorts you sound like he sounds like my youtube contact like you need to really think about making shorts i m like and he like he has all these strategies like that i don t even understand like they re so strategic that my little mind can t even i m like listen baby i get it i m not trying to be combative i ll do whatever you tell me to do but i don t understand the actions like austin s always like awesome i love working with austin because he says my brother his brother when he tells me things to do he goes first action second action third act and it s like literally listed actionable items because he knows he s working with people that are special uniquely uniquely capable specifically capable in a niche environment in a safe space so joe i m like i just like just do it i m like i get it but i feel like you re telling me something about a pdf on my instagram story that s linkable to a thing but i m confused about what i m linking to and i do post the recipes you did want to do the tortilla slap challenge we could do that as a short on your youtube channel i ve never done a short on a youtube channel but well now you re spoiling more of my content oh my gosh it s something for them to look forward to they could go see it search it out it s not like that s ruining the video it is no it s not it s like isn t it a viral challenge we got ta go i m so done with you okay do you want to talk about me again yeah there s nothing should i spoil some things on you no because you do have some things on me see that i m holding out and i thought you could hold the tortilla slap challenge to yourself but apparently although recently we have been taught we so well um i don t know how much i want to give away what don t say any of it well there s so much of it this is something i already know about that you know about all of it i guess we ll just wait let s tune in next week because maybe we ll tell you then uh for one of the things Laughter i m being that it s not even like a project it s like i don t know we re just ever expanding our family you know what that was a lot of hint to drop well no i m talking about kids specifically like our baby making process right you re right uh huh okay okay okay never mind um okay they re adopting me do i drag shane or do i grab drag crumble uh let s do both quite frankly what s up with yeah just lead with lead with crumble i think and then we ll tip down to shane respectfully because we also have to honor make up A A for shane with crumble because shane s a good man he s a great man do you know that shane literally texted me when i dropped my vlog he s like hey you don t have to use it but here s a better thumbnail and he s like he went through he screenshotted us yeah he s he s very he s super sweet god i love him so much yeah could not be a more perfect partner for me but there are still circumstances where i have to like throw my head through the window and last night so like he knew people were coming in so he was doing what he thought was best and he went to the fridge and like we had just jacked off all over the place that would be chris okay um so we had take out food from a couple nights ago and you know the stickiest thing in the world are brussels sprouts yeah and so we had gotten brussels sprouts and they ve been in the fridge and so he s thinking like oh people are coming we need to like discard of the old and so i go to throw something away and he threw the brussels sprouts in our kitchen trash can you wish you had taken it all the way out not do i wish it s to me it s common sense yeah i get it you just mad at me because i keep throwing dog A A in the kitchen trash you and shane deserve each other we take our trash out all the A A time well it was another trash out like three times a day so if i want to throw some puppy A A in it i m gon na throw some puppies and by we you mean you i m just guessing it s me and me and james this is to A A on joe a little bit even though he s a great man joe will fill the trash can up leave it filled walk away from it and then when i come in and add to the trash he goes why didn t you take it out why didn t you take it out well so he left shane and also like there was also like a little bit of chicken and i was like all this stuff i m gon na wake up and this house is going to reek and there s no getting rid of a smell that s been permeating for hours and so he was like okay i ll take it out but he didn t take it out uh as fast as i would have liked him so i start huffing and puffing and taking it out myself and he s like just chill and i was like well you re lucky i m only complaining about one thing and he s like okay what s the other one i was like no because if i tell you then i am that is complaining about it where i just want you already started when you were introduced you know like when you want to stop but you just can t because it s like yeah me and so i don t use the fake straws because i don t want to clean the fake straws right and so he s like what and i was like well those dishes that i can t put in the dishwasher have been sitting in there for a week because i m not willing to do it and it s just nothing dry and this is less shane more me i hate cups and straws that aren t dishwasher friendly it s like then what s the point yeah it s absurd because i don t want to do that yeah i don t want to do it and so then he was kind of upset at me and i said i m sorry i love you and i woke up to the dishes clean so just saying so you know what shane you might be reinforcing negative behavior and next time if i were you i would leave the dishes in the sink no because that s what it typically is and i let him know that this tactic does not work for you he needs to speak with you with love and kindness he does buy me food every night so i was thinking like maybe it is my job to do the little dishes but i don t know who knows there might be a trade off that might be a traitor is that a pete what is that i don t know it s like a knockoff lacroix called an aha and it s peach flavored maybe they ll sponsor me since the corey won t i d like to try that um oh into the crumble so something shane did that was nice is you two arrived today and there s just like the biggest box of crumble cookies out yeah and so sweet of him yeah however christopher what crumble s number one fan have you seen the tick tock that s been going viral about like crumble and them being exposed and awful no that s ridiculous well what happened but she this girl s like so serious and she s like the most popular cookie brand is like whatever and growing rapidly and she goes but they re filled with some very controversial ingredients chris has come and so i guess there s all these things that people are all upset about and it s so ridiculous i mean it s ridiculous what are you talking about look at it bleach flower artificial colors artificial flavors tbhq a synthetic preservative that may harm the immune system and so it i never started having covered until i had crumble cookies oh my gosh so but it goes into it goes like artificial flavors linked to hyperactivity in children which require a warning label in europe artificial flavors chemical mixtures produced by i mean of course the cookie s going to lead to hyperactive behavior in children and adults um high fructose cones corn syrup heavily processed sweetener linked to increased risk of weight gain type diabetes uh cancer and dementia this sounds like every food in america and that s the thing is so i saw this going viral and i i clicked out of it immediately because i was like this is so ridiculous but then i saw a bunch of people reacting to the same one being like you know what else all those things are in and they like walk into frame with like everything from the grocery store and i m like what s your beef with like you re just trying to take down crumble i mean it s it doesn t have to be crumble specific but i definitely think there should be beef with all of those things what do you mean we shouldn t be putting that A A in our body i know but nobody s ordering crumble thinking that they re putting something good into their bodies like you can taste how awful it is for your body and we still continue to do so but it s also like i take my crumbles in moderation where it s like i use their cookie cutter and i normally do it when we re in large groups of people and i just take a sliver of it see i think i m doing it in moderation but i m really just eating sliver after sliver after sliver and then all of a sudden i ve eaten a pack by myself and i m like i m A A and that s why she started eating them before the podcast and i wasn t i m like i m not food shaming you but i m just thinking like can we do it after the podcast because i know what happens five minutes into this for her i m gon na eat a whole A A lemon cookie right when we re done with this A A that was that s like it s almost like their basic sugar like okay also you know yellow dye number five is outlawed in a lot of states yet i m still A A bathing in cases well that s what i m saying of course if nobody looks into crumble cookie ingredients because we know it s awful okay with that we have some ads and we ll be right back today s podcast is sponsored by honey the easy way to save when shopping on your iphone or computer we all love to

it s more reality tv season for me yeah there s nothing really great in the summer and that s for a reason but i do have to say i am living for only murders and i m excited for the ones to come out i die did you see the second episode uh of only murderers yeah i ve only got into the first so how does amy schumer and cara delevingne pan out well they re only like three episodes and so nothing s panned out yeah i know but are they good like what is it yeah they re funny they re funny and you know how i feel about amy and you re saying her performance is good and i hate kara kara oh my gosh okay let s talk about someone you like oh i love only murders so bunny s mom makes an appearance in this season bunny is the woman who s uh murdered in the first episode oh okay she s the murderer of the season but her mom s in the first episode and she s like this senile old woman who s like also very quick witted and witty but um she s trying to cut this piece of cheese and she can t cut the cheese because she can t see very well so she s just trying to cut thinner a bunch and they film her cutting center a bunch and then she s just like A A this and like takes the thing and just stabs it into the brick of cheese and picks it up and starts biting it and she s this terribly classy rich woman it just it s funny i love it i love steve martin i A A live for martin short i can t i can t it

royalties i want to be good for you anyways like oh my gosh that start okay all right what you were saying oh it reminded me of shane one of the jingles on shane s podcast oh okay fights with shane and rylan i listen to the shingles i m like should i get jingles it s kind of offensive that we don t have them right honestly i watch shane s podcast and i m like wow rylan s never respected me ryan s never respected me or our show we ll have to purchase whoa okay we ll get some jingles yeah we ll get some jingles okay next on our iced tea this is such a mess kristen dunstan jesse plemmons are married you don t know who they are no i looked i clicked on this link and jessie yeah i only know him from friday night like most people but that is the show that really catapulted me into wanting to become an actor yeah well jesse plemmons is in a lot of other A A and he s very talented okay but i put this on the docket because jesse plemmons used to live in the house behind our house wait in studio city in valley village okay so he used to live in the house not like we do have houses in our backyards which i get is a little bit confusing but it s not he wasn t living in our backyard he lived behind like behind the fence i don t think anyone was thinking he lived in your garage people are commenting on my vlogs like who is lizzy just feeding a man that lives in a shed in her backyard oh and i am but jesse plemmons did not live in a shed in my backyard just uh for clarity he lives in a house different house different house okay anyways jesse plumbins used to live behind him you never told me that when you lived there it didn t seem like something you d give a flying A A about uh i loved friday night lights and desperate housewives were my high school among the hills that s a very generic experience like that was everybody s okay so then why would you not find it necessary to tell me that i would have gone like everybody needs to know now everybody knows now the audience knows you know chris knows get shane out of the A A gym i ll tell him too okay so jesse clemens lived in the house behind mine now he s probably in kirsten s house he s definitely moved on to kirsten s house but anyways my dogs got out one time and jesse plummens rescued them and brought him knocking on your door did he recognize bubs from the internet it was not bubs it was benny and jelly oh the pre bubs okay congratulations jessie congratulations kristin moving right along florence pug address you A A that i don t even know who that is and i know that it s pew if she wants it to be pronounced grammar police over here grammar police being wrong florence pug addresses critics of her valentino free the nipple look did you see it i did see the look and is the story that she got invited by valentino to be at something valentina wearing valentino um i did not look past her nipples okay so what s your commentary on the nipples uh so there s this thing going around in the world lately where ladies are wearing dresses they re like kendall jenner has done it and you can just see their nipples and my only i have no issue with freeing the nipples or seeing nipples or like be dick out i don t care but i found it weird that instagram allows the nipple photos i wonder if it s because they re like covered by mesh because i feel like if it wasn t a celebrity in designer this photo would have gotten blocked and that has nothing to do with my opinion on her showing her nipples i just think like instagram guidelines are choosing to let a celebrity slide i think more i don t give a A A about these guidelines or whatever honestly i think you would though if you posted a nipple photo and yours got blurred and florence pews did not i mean yeah but it s like i m not out here trying to post my nipple photos and i ve got like great breasts i know i walked in on them today oh you saw him yes i didn t know you saw him i was knocking where are you A A and you re like no but my nipples are out and i m like too late i m already looking at them you didn t say anything nice about them well i didn t know if you d want me to commentate on them after i was visually looking out of course i want you to comment nipples thanks are there any hairs yeah okay every woman s got hairy nipples i know i have hairy balls yeah that s different um i mean they re private parts of hair yeah but i wouldn t don t compare your balls to my titties there s a huge A A difference well i m just saying parts that aren t typically seen that have hair on them fair okay i just i personally it doesn t matter and i guess people were outraged well that s the the thing that bothers me the most is that there was like a uproar on the internet of people being like she s got tiny titties they were like she s got tiny titties so they re mad about the structure of her titties and i m gon na say something that s not gon na help my argument that i m just an ally but i saw her tiny titties and like loki a bit turned on i mean great i loved what she said where she was like i ve had my body for a very long time and i m not afraid of my A A tiny boobs and i don t have a huge liking for florence pug but i do really love how she handled this so do you even know who she is of course i know who she is oh i don t so just another celebrity that you re going to A A on today i m not shitty order i m saying that i don t even like florence i don t but i like how she s pretty definitive maybe i just don t like her because she started cooking on her instagram before i have the courage to cook on youtube and she also has the courage to show her nipples i think i m just jealous honestly i m saying i m down as A A for her responses i get the jealousy i was jealous of haley bieber s A A soundstage i was like i thought this was a youtube channel this crazy A A my A A dog s dead this was horrible this is a month after no it hasn t even been a month this was last week yes it was it was well before and you were calling me about something crazy anyways i m going through the worst time of my life and this A A has the audacity to text me i m so pissed haley bieber shoots on a soundstage well i just couldn t believe it because if you look at haley bieber s channel it s like it s it looks like a bathroom it looks like a bathroom and i think it originally once was but it just so like she did on refinery like uh check out my studio tour and i just my mind was blown because it s a youtube channel and i know what youtube channels make yeah and there s like a crew or a staff of a hundred there s the most fancy cameras lighting this set had to have been a hundred k plus to build and i know how much production costs when you count all those heads you got ta multiply it by hundreds i m like even if she s bulk shooting this show like four episodes in a day there s no way it s making what they re spending so i was just like wow this is and really like i have no beef with it i m just like a little jealous because i m like you have real big fu money to just be like look at all these people i hire for my A A hobby for my this job i don t need that s like me when i pa do you want this water whatever i don t care i have a podcast and a famous dog moving right along next thing s next god damn it you need to work on your transition that was me i shouldn t say the gd word why i just feel like a little bad yeah we do love god we re a couple of god loving A A everything is like not on tone today because we missed each other and i told you we needed to go to breakfast but we didn t get to go to breakfast because we got here at p m okay doja cat asked stranger things noah schnapp to set her up with joseph quinn so i saw this headline floating around everywhere and i couldn t bring it uh i couldn t care enough to click okay so here s here s the real t all right so dosia dm d noah said let me get at your boy noah said slide into the dms then noah screen grabs the private conversation he had with doja posts it because it s funny it s a A A funny conversation and it s dogicat and some guy on stranger things why didn t she go straight to the source i don t A A know but then dosia loses her A A starts A A besmirching noah s name on the internet literally goes on a live he s a snake he s a weasel he shouldn t have done that uses those words she s no but she like she kind of played he s like i m not trying to say like he s a snake he s a weasel but like that s kind of snake weasel behavior she s like the audacity how dare he like it s a power play on his part and he s more famous than i am and like a stranger is that true a stranger s thing actor is more popular than doger cat oh yeah stranger things is the biggest thing in the world can t get into it and i ve tried man maybe it s because of the kovid one of the side effects of covet is you don t get what everybody else gets you get other things like a tingly feeling for florence pug s nipples okay when you don t even like her in your in your heterosexual loins okay so and did he respond what s the story i don t think he responded but people are like dosia man like watch your language are people always kind of like dosia yeah like those those are A A that s the other thing this A A she s talking about him like being out of pocket on the internet like i could not think of anyone more out of pocket on the internet than doji cat she s like taco bell paid me a million dollars to write a jingle and i m A A mad about it so here s my passive aggressive jingle that s actually going to be really good for taco bell i thought she should have got more or it didn t go through no i m i m making up that number but she was irritated that she had had to do branded content and so she like wrote a jingle about the mexican pizza it s so doesn t matter but the point being is like i what what makes me more crazy than anything is somebody taking an absurd amount of money from a company and then acting put the A A out for the seven second thing they have to put on a tick tock to earn that you know what i mean yeah it s silly it s silly it s silly anything else or should we move on i just thought that was crazy that she would go so gnarly in on a boy like no one he s only is what i read right yeah i mean all of it s all if it s wild to get that upset publicly is a bit much yeah sometimes uh yeah i ve learned that if you re even feeling upset it s best to just like put your phone away oh i really want to tease you right now but i m not going to do it thank you i appreciate it can i please do it it depends on what it was about i think you know what i m going to say what i m just not trying to trade you right now betray me isn t that the typo Laughter i feel bad about it i m like turning red i m sorry anyways north s stop sign at the talent show or the fashion show i see i only saw the photo headline of that too so kim kardashian takes north north to fashion shows all the time and always has because north loves fashion and gore vfx makeup um and north was like irritated that there were people in the crowd that were looking at her and filming her instead of and this is kim s spin on it instead of paying attention to the fashion show so north s A A entitled ass writes stop on a sign and holds it up so this guy who s filming like she locks eyes with him and holds up a sign that just says stop and it s like i get it stop the model stop the show stop filming me and she keeps like coming out of these hotels like you guys waited out here for us to take our pictures why would you do that and it s like she s making a good point but it s annoying wait so she went to a fashion show that s being filmed and wrote stop filming me no she well yes so those statements are true but the fashion show was probably being filmed professionally this is somebody in the audience with their own camera phone filming north and kim and so did she come prepared with the stop sign no or did she write it materials at her seat yeah she wrote it with materials that are seen i don t hate that i don t hate it but like i kind of there s something about their what listen i m by no means famous but there is yes you are no i mean really not but right but there is a certain thing about like being in pub i have no issue saying hi to anyone that wants to say hi take a picture with anyone that wants to say hi to me but it is uncomfortable when somebody s taking a photo from afar without your permission i don t even care about the permission thing it s like you could just come say hi and take a photo instead of like doing a weird thing from afar where i can obviously see that it s going to kill it and it makes me uncomfortable and so like i understand north feeling on like such a grand scale yeah like stop yeah stop yeah you know yeah so i m with you north um you know i last last time we spoke i m i became a team northerner but maybe i m missing something because all the headlines i saw granted i didn t click on them they were like kim s facing backlash for north s behavior regarding stop right but it s also like everything you just said is so valid i just i think but i think no matter what people are going to be irritated with an incredibly privileged child like north west and she didn t ask to be born into that no but i did so what the A A she s doing the best she can this is not what i ordered and i feel like again this isn t related to me but i remember back in well even recently i saw uh there were fans waiting outside of one of justin bieber s like town houses or condos or something yeah and they were asking for a photo and he said no i m not going to do it yeah he s like this is my home my home and i don t disagree with him but also at another point in time i remember him saying like i feel like a zoo animal yeah and i can t imagine that north doesn t feel the same he s lonely now he has haley but thank god i love that love all right well let s get into some hold on i m cracking my jaw all right i m ready let s get into some advice though okay do you want to do uh ver do you want to do a voicemail or one that s do a voicemail because i think i need better glasses again i think my eyes are getting more A A up from editing well i could read can you okay hey girlie so i was a psychiatrist six years i kind of suspected that he may have been gay because i came across in having a fake account where he was pretending to be female and having men comment on it and he was responding to it fast forward we spoke another another reason besides that but i came across his profile that he has with his lover that it s a male it doesn t have many friends on it and doesn t have much other than like pictures of them together do i congratulate him for taking that step and coming out or do i just pretend like i didn t see it and let him live in his peace and it says live in his peace and let him come out when he feels ready to fully do that um and not secretly thank you love you so did you understand what s going on yeah but recap it for chris so for chris who s like got a finger up his nose right now okay so this woman was dating a man the man had a secret account where he was acting as a girl flirting with men and then they broke up unrelated to all of this and now he has a separate page that is him with his current boyfriend but he s hiding it or he s not hiding it but it doesn t have like very many followers so it s like his private page for him and his new boyfriend and so she s asking do i congratulate him or do i not acknowledge it and let him come out on his own terms i think you let him come out on his own terms also are you do you talk to him if you re talking to your ex i mean it seems pretty applicable if she feels comfortable reaching out to him i would say if you don t speak regularly there s no reason why you should text him but if he has a page that s public yeah that s showcasing him and his new boyfriend and you guys are civil and there isn t a bunch of anger on your end surrounding him um being with a man i don t see why she wouldn t bring it up i for me it s like i didn t text my ex boyfriend when his dad died because i i m not on speaking terms with him and i don t think anything coming from me would feel positive or good especially in a time of in a time of such a magnitude like coming out or losing losing someone so i think like are you reaching out for yourself or are you reaching out for him what s the dynamic of your current relationship not your past even if it is for herself though she might be seeking some closure um for herself because i haven t dated somebody that has come out um in attraction to an opposite sex but i can imagine it might have done something to your her confidence as well as a person which even if you re not angry at him it might have messed with your psyche a little bit too so if you need that closure and it s not a private account of his i don t see a problem with reaching out to him honestly and i i think you know there s more than one way to skin a cat but i also hi yo but i also think um my my advice my advice though is a bit different and it would definitely be you re never going to get closure from a third party it s got to come from your yourself you can not rely on other people to give you your closure it has to come from yourself and if you re not on speaking terms with this guy don t reach out to him find closure on your own and if when he s ready to come out it s his business so i wouldn t uh if you re assuming he s still closeted i would say you know let let him come out on his own time yeah especially if it feels a little uh not petty on your end but you almost like if you re feeling like you want to rub it in for some reason other than actual um joy and celebratory yeah like if there s any alter ulterior of motive i would say hold off because he s already obviously struggling um so i would say if it s pure congratulations on your end or if it s for closure for you i would think about it but if not i don t know chris chris are you ready to come out honey baby no i think that s good advice i think outing people in general is a terrible thing so if they re not out don t do that well yeah but this is somebody i don t think she s trying to out him she s trying to have a private conversation with him and when you re dating some i mean i don t know what it s like what would you do if you re one of somebody you were dating came out to you um i would try with every fiber of my self to not make it about me because i don t think it has anything to do with me you know what i mean it doesn t not hurt though if you ve been together i m not saying no and i get that but i also think that like the truth of the situation is it s just not about me it s about them yeah and they probably didn t get into the relationship with the girl trying to yeah and if and if it s something that they re just coming to terms with you know it s not my job to help anybody through anything i can if i want to if i m emotionally available to do so like if my glass is full enough to spill over onto someone else s i m happy to share but more often than not if i know that i m not going to be able to be of service to somebody until i work on whatever i m going through then i showing up is almost not passive aggressive i just don t have a better term for it but it s like if i m doing something that s not coming from a very healthy place inside my heart it s usually not going to feel good to the person who s getting it from me right it would be very hard though to not be able to it would be very hard it s a hard situation yeah i do hope that he does tell her though because i before i came out was in a relationship with a woman who i the way we broke him the way things ended i know i ended up hurting her feelings and i didn t mean to i just wasn t out and i didn t know how to handle the situation it s kind of a long story but later on after i came out i told her and she like teary eyed hugged me and it like i think meant a lot to her because i think she had thought probably closed up some loose ends for her as well probably things just made more sense so i i kind of hope that he would at some point i m and i think the same is true for all breakups in all situations if it s bad and there s an explanation at the end of the road to give it but i don t again like i don t think anybody should be waiting for that i always think that if someone has an amends to make they should make it i don t think being gay or coming out as gay requires you to make an amends though but the explanation might be nice for someone else to hear though i don t think a person being gay or coming out has to make an apology or say listen i m gay i m sorry like because that just when i said i m sorry but i think like explaining in a way that this relationship has hit a dead end because of yes no it doesn t have to be an apology no but you know and i had that like i was uh with a guy for a very long time and when we broke up i said i m not going to speak to you for a very long time and i waited like a year and a half or something before i reached back out and he just never wanted to talk again so we just never spoke again and so i think your advice is of not waiting for him for closure is sound advice but if he comes around to it um i think being open to it is great yes hi ryland and lizzy first i wanted to say i absolutely love the podcast and i m so glad we were getting to see more of lizzy through her vlogs plug chris and chris through shane s podcast plug i m in about a month me and my wife both female are planning on moving out of our parents house for the first time into our own apartment i struggle with anxiety and depression without medication and although i am excited about our move i feel like once it happens i m going to crumble beneath both my depression and anxiety it s the thought of big irreversible change and commitment to the apartment complex that scares me the most i wanted to ask what advice you all could give me to help me get past the first few days of packing and moving until i can get settled in i would love to hear how shane ryland and ryland deal with the constant back and forth to colorado and lizzie because of her move and how attached she felt to her last home and would especially love to hear from chris as he has now dealt with difficult past few months thank you all so much for taking your time to read this love a chris obsessed listener wow does she know about what no lizzie um listen A A i regret leaving my house every day and cry about it endlessly your past house yeah really that s one of the things that you re crying about oh my god yeah i could cry right now thinking about it it s because like i remember sitting in my living room and thinking like wow this is really great and it s all going to end in your previous house literally crying you should not have picked this bronze way to go i hope you re okay with your anxiety depression are you not happy at your new house no Laughter lizzie hold on don t do it wow i didn t know that yeah but it s only because nothing in this life is ever going to be good again but here i m looking i m still going that s my point i m in a deep deep deep depression and full of anxiety to the point of it being crippling and like i stopped bathing and brushing my teeth but but the com let me wrap it around okay okay okay the wrapping around is that i know that i have to and the knowledge that i have to encourages me to find the will to do so and it always brings me back to the belief of i would rather be present here on this earth right now than not and as long as i m going to be present here i might as well do everything within my power to make the most of this experience and in order to do that it means i have to get up and i have to keep going and trying things because i would have never known the love and joy and happiness of that house if i had stayed and wallowed in my previous depression so yes is a really hard period of time but when you start chain when you settle into the change it becomes your now and then your now becomes your happy and then you re going to go through another metamorphosis which is going to hurt but no matter what if you re constantly focusing on building with the change you can trust in your heart of hearts that you re gon na find the same comfort and joy that you once had it will be different if you re dealing with loss it s always going to be different and it s going to look different and you re never going to not miss what you really miss but you re going to have a different a different sense of fulfillment right and as much as it A A sucks to say like it s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all and if you stay where you are you re gon na miss out on a lot of things that you could potentially love yeah and i think um oh can i say one more thing yeah and to piggyback off that because you specifically said you re worried about getting locked in and stuck in an apartment that s the beautiful thing about life it is constantly changing it is constantly evolving if you don t like where you are you can always A A leave it nobody can force you to stay unless you re in jail so just don t go to jail girl and it s all good but i have huge attachment issues to things like and i always am comparing like even when we move from our previous california house to our last california house i every time i m walking the dogs i m comparing the walk i m comparing because i m such a routine person that i m always comparing like what was and what is and so when we moved to colorado it was a very obviously a huge decision and with that i think it turned my whole life around i think i found a new sense of energy a new sense of purpose a new direction but that doesn t mean i also didn t feel like a part of me was dying like i had moved to la and i had built such a life for myself in la and i have accomplished a lot of what i wanted to do but there s still a lot that i want to do and sometimes i feel further from that leaving that um so i do still find myself comparing and contrasting a lot but i think if you don t dare to try your life is gon na stay stagnant and boring and i think it s more depressing yeah even if you have moments of depression when you move out i think you ll grow from it and if this next department isn t the end all be all it will be a stepping stone to what s next and what will be great for you but i advise you uh going full for force ahead as much as possible yeah and you got like life is all a journey so you got ta enjoy the trip it s never about the destination because news flash the destination is death but i do think like yeah there s def like can another thing is so because uh long story short i m having a hard time sleeping in my bedroom because it makes me sad so i ve been sleeping on the couch in the living room but because i m sleeping on the couch in the living room i m staying up later with joe and watching tv so my sleep schedule has now shifted from me going to bed and cursing joe s name for not coming to bed with me to someone who stays up late into the night with my husband and we have been having so much A A fun and we ve been laughing so hard and it s like i i loved him before and i love him even more now yeah and it s like our our relationship has changed from into like a bigger friendship than i even knew was possible because i worship the man and i love him and i m obsessed with him and like now we have these giggly stupid A A late nights where we re like let s watch another episode and then i m like what time is it he looks at the fl the phone and he s like it s and it s like it s three o clock in the morning and we ve been up all night like giggling like A A idiots and talking about nothing and watching these trashy tv shows like terminal list which i love it s trash but it s but so the point is if i had stayed on my yeah i go to bed at eight and i read and i wake up and this is my regimen i never would have had this story with joe and we ll be back to that because you and i are those girls oh yeah i ll be back to that but it s fun in the moment chris she did specifically want your advice as well so basically she s moving out of her parents house and uh into her first apartment with her girlfriend and she s uh she s fearful of it causing a lot of anxiety um surrounding the change um i mean i think what you guys said is really really great first off like i think you had a lot of really good advice already i don t know that i can add to that other than give like past experiences of like when i left my parents house and moved into like the apartment that i m in currently that was terrifying for me and not being i m just like i get very attached to people uh whether that s a relationship or my mother or whatever like i once i love somebody you re my everything and i can t live without you you know and uh so leaving my mother right and going to an apartment was really really tough for me um and i didn t think i could do that but i did and i got used to it and it was tough at first and sleeping situation was weird in living situation and my food and all of it was weird and scary but um and ended up being for the best um and i find that a lot of things that scared me even like my first relationship who i thought i was gon na marry this person um we didn t and i was you know cheated on we broke up and stuff ended up being for the best and looking back i realized how bad and toxic that relationship was and i grew from it i learned a lot from it and so i think it s it s terrifying always when these things happen but at least from my life experiences they almost always end up being for the best and i know i mean it s completely different like losing someone like something like well lizzie s been through or or anything like a living thing that you re attached to right but um i don t know i mean i think i truly believe that at some point it gets better and and i ve said this on the podcast i m just like repeating myself now i don t think i ve better advice on what you guys gave but i ve just found that as impossible as things have felt and as much as i haven t wanted to be here at times that eventually always goes away and i eventually always feel better and then i always end up being happy for having stuck through it and life is worth it in the end i don t know i i specifically like what you said about being scared and like how terrifying it can be to go through a change and i was uh actually like having a public conversation about this this morning a little bit but when i was a little girl i was absolutely A A terrified to be alone in my bedroom i was positive if i stayed by myself in my room through the night i was gon na die there was no other option i would scream i would sit in my room to the age of like eight like this was a long A A terror phase where i would scream bloody murder i would sneak out of my room as soon as my parents were asleep and i would hide underneath my dad s dirty laundry and sleep in their room and they would wake up like pissed that i had slept in their room again and one night they like forced me into my room and they were like you need to stay here all night you can not leave this room like you know on on the brink of boarding my door up so i couldn t sneak out and come sleep in their dirty clothes and i screamed all night and i cried all night and i was so A A scared and then the A A sun came up in the morning and i realized that all of my fears everything that my childhood anxiety was telling me would happen did not happen and because i sat through it even though it was agonizing and horrible and terrifying i came to the realization that i would be okay if i faced the fear and went through it and that s kind of the only way to get over A A you got ta scream through the night and know that the sun s gon na rise in the morning and i think the more that we can embrace change and i m speaking to myself too the better our lives become because holding on to something that isn t or trying to force something that your life is trying to take you away from is only going to make you miserable and i think that everything that you embrace or every change that happens to you there s a new gift that will unfold and you re gon na like walk down this surprising curvy road of life that is obvious like something that s so great to embrace you know and also it s so sick not living with your parents dude it is so A A chill to not live with your parents you re gon na get out there and be like what was i thinking you know you can you can A A on your couch crazy you can A A in your kitchen jack off wherever you want you can jizz them everywhere A A you can rub your menstrual blood down the walls who gives a A A it s your apartment yikes okay well i hope we helped um we have a lot more advice but there were honestly some great submissions but we ll get into it on next week s episode thank you guys so much for watching and supporting our show uh obviously subscribe to lizzy s vlog yeah obviously lizzie gordon chris has one

Music thank you Music hello girlies and welcome to another episode of the Sip I m Ryland Adams of course joined by Elizabeth I m okay hello hello everyone I hope you re well Lizzy is unwell why am I on well I don t think are you kidding me are you kidding me I am the wellest I ve been in a matter of days oh I know what you re talking about she literally so she starts texting me this morning and she goes my shared notes don t work my iPhone s broken so I m adding things to an email and I m gon na send you an email and then she mass texting me saying and I m gon na send you more topics in minutes scratch that minutes and then she calls me after I had put the document together hours later and she goes sorry I m gon na be late and I go Lizzy what all right like that s fine because whatever like I m always it s hard to set up virtual for me and she s like well yeah I I forgot about us and I go how did you forget about us you literally just created hot topics for us this morning and she goes well now I m having to cancel an orange theory class I m like you booked an orange theory class for the same time we re recording the podcast after you plan to produce the podcast what s going on well I had a migraine yesterday that was really bad like I like I get migraines pretty bad honestly but it s there s few and far between but I like lose sight in one eye entirely and then it s just a throw robbing in the frontal lobes and I can t do anything and you know I left my Vlog to the last second because I ve been go go going and I was like working on my Vlog and I was like huh that s funny I can t really see it anymore and then I was like No And then right when that hit in my Joe had ordered us a box spring to put the bed on instead of a bed frame so the dogs can t get underneath it and um I had to put that together it was like a build your own box A A spring and I was like I had like one eye shut like James was helping me I was like I can t see you like it was bad and then I just laid in bed and had like black fish on in the background you know I m sick when I m watching Blackfish I don t even know what that is dude it s a really sad inspiring documentary about the uh trafficking of orca whales that s been going on since like the s and is pretty A A and they re trafficking them to go to zoos or what yeah to go to Sea World so um for forever like since I think is when the first Orca was captured in maybe British Columbia or Washington I can t remember where but they put this fish or this uh this Orca in uh in captivity and started making him do performances and um yeah since then they ve just been going out stealing baby orcas from their mothers in the wild and orcas are very family based very intelligent communicative Community Driven animals and they re locking them up in concrete pools and making them swim for fish and it s just it s pretty disgusting but Blackfish came out in and had a very successful result in which you know legislatures being passed now like in Florida I believe recently legislation was passed that makes what they re doing with these orcas not okay and it puts a stop to the Perpetual breeding of them in captivity and then like the taking of the babies from these moms and redistributing them around the country to make money off of them um but there s still a lot of these orcas who live to be like in the wild who have been in captivity for years so and now they probably don t know how to exist in the wild even if they were re released it well it s an interesting things so just like you know we have cultures as human beings these animals have cultures as well so you ve taken a baby from his mom years ago and you ve put them in a dark box for his entire life like removed all the mental stimulation he had in the wild all the relationships he had in the wild and they have this part of their brain that s more developed than the human brain when it comes to emotions so they re very emotionally uh in touch animals and you put them back out into the wild but they may not find their pot again but they might find a pod that they could you know happily coexist with so when they are re released into the wild sometimes it s successful and but they need to be you know monitored for life to some degree because they have become dependent upon human interaction and do you think some of them are gay just curious the whales that s just interesting that s an interesting pivot I m sure they are honestly I m sure they are it s um I know the orcas are specifically female like uh like the women are the alphas like bonobos and bonobos the way that you get in is you make a female higher come but that s for The Joe Rogan podcast we don t have to get into vanilla s here well do you notice anything different about me yeah you shaved you sick A A isn t it gross no I mean you kind of like I feel like I need to take you to get a lip flip what what does that even mean I just want a tiny bit more upper lip from you if you re not gon na have facial hair you think I need to get it like just a little lift you know what I mean it s not it s never gon na happen again I m not well so young it s crazy I think I m fine looking older though like I would rather tell you the sad A A about whales and you re like but did you notice I mean it was too dark for the top for the first four minutes of the show I think if it was minutes in I could have gone down more of a journey with you but I don t want people to you ve got your own trauma you ve got your own trauma let s talk about your face I ll do whatever I can for the well send me a link is there a GoFundMe dude honestly I think we need to Free Willy this A A like we just got ta bust up in there and A A sprang them you know what I m saying jailbreak let s get him yeah cause we can we re capable of holding those I don t how much how many pounds does a well even weigh I think it s like uh eight tons okay well enough well talk let s get back to me okay yeah back to you and you re and you re well no it s you re under a Flip Flip it s in part an apology to you because I have sympathy for you and all women I don t shave my face you sick A A no I m not saying that you shave your face but as I transformed myself into Regina George for Shane s upcoming podcast I realized just how much work it takes and how much effort it takes to settle in to record a podcast with a lot of hair with makeup on your face because you have to like I m always annoyed that you re does my hair of a good like this with the headphones I m like Lizzy I don t A A care but now I have sympathy for how that goes down because yeah it was a A A nightmare I mean you should have had the sympathy because you ve been psycho about your hair and you don t really have much I know but then when you add the length it is like one wrong move with your hair could make you look horrible the entire podcast and so I m sitting there like trying to get my angle right and then I open my mouth and lipstick is all over my teeth how would you feel how would you feel if after realizing you have that lipstick on your teeth you realize that the men sitting in front of you didn t A A tell you and then later on when they had beef with you they rubbed it in your face how bad would you feel no I feel pretty bad and when I posted a photo on Snapchat about it all the responses were about you justice for Lizzy yeah you know literally they were all saying Justice for Lizzy now you know what it s like for Lizzy and I was like well yeah I text did Lizzy about it okay so I do feel bad Mr never checks the DMS is responding to that I ll never know what it s like to menstruate but just having the pressure of I did feel like it was a lot more pressure once you put on the additives like me just being me not having to put anything on once you start putting things on your face then it feels like it has to be perfect and then you feel like the outfit so it s a nightmare and I I feel for all you ladies out there thanks dude thanks man I appreciate it it just took you what like seven times in drag to figure it out yeah well what s going on with you I saw that you re you re doing what what I m doing a lot man next on the document um oh I found a way to manage my grief what are you doing okay so like this uh today I put a vlog up and honestly dude like I was having a mental breakdown about it because I was like I can t post it doesn t normally that s a good sign normally well no I mean like the reason why is because I was like oh this is relentlessly sad and it s hopeless like usually I m able to be like you know and this is happening but like let s be grateful for what we have and then in this one I was just like I don t know guys like I m A A sad and a little hopeless and like I had I had tried three times if I m an introduction and you know that I m a one take type of A A and my motto is if it s not on camera it s not meant to be and I shot an introduction for this three times you know I like cooked I m like so distracted while I m cooking I like had to go to the grocery store two times and like couldn t even Vlog it like I m dead behind the eye all of it was like a nightmare and then I you know was like okay I ve been using my Vlog as a place to be like working through this grief with jelly and everything so I m just gon na be honest and so I m crying through the whole thing like sobbing crying uncontrollably because that s what I ve been like lately and anyway well yeah fast forward who cares very fast no I feel bad for you too I do I really do no I m joking I do I feel bad for Joe I feel bad because all of us are going through it I m not the only person who lost jelly but um I uh I heard so meditation is a big thing that you talk about doing as a way to ground yourself and keep yourself mentally healthy and fit for battle each day is a way that I look at it and I I too have my version of meditating but I I kind of I don t have a program around my meditation and I feel often like when people say things like oh meditate girl it s like A A what the A A do you mean like that is the most abstract A A I ve ever heard and it s not actionable until it transforms your life it does sound woo woo and annoying but the thing is like when I when you when as an uneducated person around meditation I hear meditation and I just think someone s sitting there like a fruit ninja and like oh thought slice thought slice like that s all they re doing they re just bashing ninja slicing off their thoughts and that doesn t work for me you know what I mean because then it s like I just can t do it I m ADHD I got a lot of A A thoughts and I tell people most my thoughts you know what I mean so um I was reading in a book the one thing you can do before you re able to clear your mind and you know Goose fraba or what the A A ever you can read a poem or a meditation or a prayer and focusing on those words specifically as you say it ground you and if you choose one with intention that can be really good for you and one of the ones I had never explored was this meditation called just for today and in this meditation it s basically like a to do list like you know how you can buy one of those like journals on Amazon or what the A A ever that it s like give yourself a gold star when you brush your teeth like give yourself a gold star when you make your bed this is this is like a version of that that s like soulfully nourishing and makes me realize that even though I m sitting here and now and sad and A A and don t know what to do oh I don t have to know what to do just for today I just have to do what these things are so the Just For Today Meditation is a series of paragraphs of what I need to do just for today and it really took the pressure off of figuring things out it s like okay yeah I can be sad and just for today I m gon na not find problems in the world just for today I m gon na do a good deed and not tell anyone about it which is really hard for me because I love to tell people the good A A I m doing just for today I m not gon na put my negative A A onto somebody else just for today I m going to choose to be happy just those little things and it s like I don t have to worry about doing this for more than a day because if I have to worry about doing this forever my mind s gon na explode but just for today I m going to focus on these things and it really shifted me out of my funk and was like oh my God that that s so that s so helpful like I m gon na do the things I don t want to do I m gon na pick my A A up you know what I mean I want to brush my teeth I m going to wash my face things that I d stop doing because the sadness has creeped into my real life and it s like yeah I could say well I m still doing my work but it s like well you re a year old woman who doesn t wash her face and brush her teeth at night and that s kind of weird like you re do do your dishes like you don t have someone to do your dishes for you do your A A dishes all of these things I stopped doing and I realized like oh I can be sad and I can do these things just for today so I wanted to like Break Down The Meditation thing and like make it actionable well and I think your journey to getting there is also okay because grief hits in different moments everyone Grieves in different phases it hits people differently in different ways so even the two guys in your household it might hit them completely differently like I and I said poor Joe because it has been a running theme of you scream crying for months and months and months and Joe s just like oh my gosh how can I get her to stop scream crying up he isn t hurting himself but yeah and I think when I m when I m like manifesting Doom as well I think getting back to what really helped me is before I go to bed and right when I wake up like before I move or do anything I think of three things that I m grateful for because it just shifts you from thinking of oh I have like a half an hour of getting the animals situated I have to go work out and then I have to work for eight hours it s like oh my gosh I have these four animals that love me and that I get so spoiled to endure there you know just changing your perspective because it is it is easy to fall into a oh this is yeah yeah and I I m definitely still sad your girl s still scream crying but but I m washing my face and I m brushing my teeth you know what I m saying and you made a box spring mattress which is the biggest migraine bless you so let s go finish my video what s going on with this movie of yours because you got hired to direct a movie and I heard all about it and you told me on multiple occasions as if you hadn t told me like it was the first time ever which I I just I just joined in on the excitement for you like it was the first time oh my gosh really it s a good friend another question Ryan s ryland s loyalty and sweetness it s right there that s it indicative of a good man right there um yeah so you know I ve been scream crying about getting a job and like wanting to work and like all this A A and you know fainting in front of strangers for sympathy and just not really getting anywhere and then I get a call out of the blue from this guy who I wrote a movie for like five years ago that got made and he s like do you want to direct this movie for me and I was like I ve manifested the opportunity of my dreams yes and then like I read the script and I was like oh no but I was like you know what just keep just keep going do this project because when you do your next project it ll take the mystery out of it like just just do the work and Trust the process and then like I started doing the work you know what I mean like I called my DP I like was uh thinking about breaking down the script and casting and I m like oh who can I who can I afford to bring into this project who s immensely talented and that that will do a favor for me because you know the budget was also non fucking existent like I literally he s like well how low will you work for and this is a pro this is a pattern in my life like for the longest I would be like I m free if it s my dream I ll do it for free and it s like no I stopped doing that you got into a certainly yeah I mean Steven Spielberg calls and he says Lizzy will you direct this movie I m not going to pay you I m gon na do Steven Spielberg s A A movie you know what I m saying Steven didn t call this was not Steven Spielberg so I like I was like I I need to I need to not work for free so I was like I ll just do it for my rent but to be completely honest the amount of Labor that goes into directing a feature film is more than a month s worth of rent and all of your mental capacity honestly exactly exactly so it s like the opportunity cost like I have all these other things going I was like I can close out these accounts and then have the space free but I can only give him nine days I m like I m working through all this I m making these choices like I have a visual in my mind of what the films to look like I know how to put it together I know how to work on a budget like all this stuff and then every time I like made a decision he would fight me on it tooth and nail and I was just like you know what I don t have the additional capacity to argue with you when you already don t comprehend the amount of favors and services you re getting for basically free so I said I opened my hands up to the universe and I said God you tricky A A or you try to teach me the same lesson again and God said yes and I said nice try A A and then I called and quit and what did he do um he he got I think he gets it you know yeah when every single decision is is met with a minute argument I think it s pretty A A clear that things aren t going to work out and at one point he s like I m not trying to fight and I was like right I get that I need you to understand that I m frustrated right now because I feel like I m trying to convince you not to eat rat poison like that was the level of absurdity to the situation putting your name on it if you re doing it as somewhat of a favor as a Resume Builder if it s not in line with what yeah it wouldn t even build my resume the credit would be useless I ve made bad movies bad movies don t change lives and making bad movies only teaches you how to make bad movies and it s also like I m not I don t want to not pay people right so if I tell you someone s bottom line rate you pay their bottom line rate or you move on yeah or find somebody else yeah and find somebody that wants the project and I don t want to work with anybody else so like take the A A favor say thank you and move on but he couldn t say thank you and thank God he couldn t because that gave me a moment of pause before I got even deeper into the project and was like I can t do this so I quit that which is great well speaking of movies you would finish the first draft of the Christmas movie I have I have and I m very excited to read it it s been very busy for me so I haven t got I think probably tomorrow after the podcast goes live I ll be able to sit down with a cup of coffee enjoy what has been written for us by you um but I did like get a little angry at you there was like tension on my end towards you do you not remember this because I was kind of assuming honestly I ve got to tell her why I m fuming or that I m going to be passive aggressive and I m never passive aggressive with you so yeah but when it s not a joke you know yeah go ahead air your A A my grievances yeah um well let me see if I can even find it this quickly yeah go through your files I can tell you I can tell you out off the top of my head exactly what it is I sent you the script you said I can piecemeal read it I can read it in a few different sections I did not say it like that you said I can read a little bit here and there basically I said don t do that I said you always read a movie script in one sitting no it was your tone see this is why I have to uh do it like this oh here I m getting to the juice yeah here I go okay do you have time to read our script and because I know that you ve spent so much time and energy and poured your heart into this project I don t want to disregard it and I am excited to read it but I was also like my head was spinning with work and that s fine I literally asked do you have time and so I was like here s my excuses so I don t have a lot of time until Wednesday afternoon but I can try to read some of it before I go to bed tonight and you said never read a movie in pieces comma always do it in one sitting and so until you take commas and periods as direct slaps to the face that was another not argument we had but she was she was periods and I was like Lizzy stop with the period I don t care if it s gen Z of me to not like the A A periods I think they re rude if it s not because like you can not get the diction of somebody s voice through text message and so if you re not adding like emojis which I get is over the top a period to end like a whatever sentence just feels like oh that person hates me it gives me the ick periods give me the Ick and so what I do unless it s like a sad message or like condolences or something I just hit return and start a new line instead of doing a period because I don t want people to think I hate them good for you I don t think anyone I don t think anyone really reads into period I don t know what to say like I know that they do because I see it going viral on Tick Tock but it s like for real like y all y all getting upset over a period now and so I was upset about the way because and I know there s a lot of periods in this script I need you to know before you read it there s a period at the end of every sentence and that s fine one of them has anything to do with you it feels completely different I will tell you that it s not a text message it s a piece of work um and so I I know you didn t mean it like oh you re a A A idiot for not knowing that you can t read a script in multiple pieces but it made me feel stupid like oh you don t know anything like you have to read a script in one sitting you A A loser and that s how I took it in my head like that was my interpretation and I know that that wasn t you re just being like I want you to read it in one sitting so I wish you would have just been like oh I d prefer if you could just read it all in one sitting that would be great because like you could get the whole picture in my mind previously I ve read scripts in chunks because I m a little bit slow I was school was never my forte and so I ll like read a chunk of a script and I ll process I ll think about what I read and then when I come back I m like oh I ve internalized what was going on in that chunk and now I m ready to dive in again so I just sent you back an eye roll Emoji just like that s it and then I then I think I just I ghosted you you ghosted me so like an hour later I said I m sorry about my eye roll I felt stupid the way you worded reading scripts in one sitting I took it as I m stupid for not knowing that and have always read in multiple chunks but I m happy to read it in one sitting if that s your preference I know you worked really hard on it and I m very excited about it and then my response was like literally thought nothing of any of that had zero thoughts about all of our exchange I think I was just doing seven other things at the same time you were just having a little meltdown privately but honestly so I do have to say like I never ever was that I I don t mansplain things you know what I mean like I m not like saying you A A idiot it was me internalizing it from my own like non success as an actor well no you also people do read scripts and try people do read scripts in chunks but I I don t personally like that and I know that most writers don t love that because what you re consuming is meant to be consumed in a single sitting do you know what I m saying like I ve never seen the movie well you see this pisses Shane off about me too like sometimes it will be late and he ll want to start a movie and I m like oh let s start it and he goes well no you re gon na fall asleep and I said well then we pick it up and start it tomorrow night and he s like you can not do that and I was like yeah I can I do that with everything that I do why can t I like I don t edit videos in one sitting I m like I did a really good three hours I m gon na come back to this after I have lunch and work out you know wow you re something I know it s different people no I mean I m the same way I m like well I can t get up from this computer until I m either blind in one eye having a migraine or done with this video is that Shane too he s like once he starts something he ll work for hours hours and I m just not that kind of person I m like if I m tired I m going to sleep and I ll pick up this movie tomorrow and I ll think it s just as great but I will read this in one sitting I will do it justice for you we have to cut like pages from it and also the reason why I was like what are you doing was because I wanted to read it out loud with somebody so I was seeing if that could be you oh and then I wound up reading it out loud with my friend Shannon which is actually why I didn t respond to your text messages because I was reading the script out loud no I understand and I m very excited to read it tomorrow and hopefully all of you will get to see this

sleeping so shut up and then he s like he pulls out his phone and I go that s gon na make you absolutely never fall to sleep put away your phone and like try to do some breathing exercises and fall asleep so then I fall back asleep and the dogs do what they do in the morning and they woke me up and I he and he s like awake and I said what are you doing and he goes well I haven t been able to fall asleep yet and so then we got up and we had a little morning date we went and had like a coffee a fall coffee tour we went to like uh Dutch Brothers we went to Dunkin Donuts we got all their different pumpkin flavored everythings and we just had a nice little cute date morning and I don t think I ve ever had like a morning date with Shane because he s he s a sleeper you know sleepy boy like Joe so there we are just wanted to give you a quick update but uh an exciting news for you are you gon na reveal the great should we just like wait so we don t jinx it and reveal it next week when I get it oh fine yeah come back next week okay you your vacations then you had like so you have been a Non Stop World traveler since I ve seen you last yeah so I left you and I went I took that hour pilgrimage to the San Juan Islands off of Washington state which how could it possibly take hours to get to like a state above you two states honest to God so it was uh you know a basic two hour flight and then you wait two hours for your shuttle to the ferry and then you wait two hours for the ferry and then you get on the ferry uh it was an hour and minutes to the ferry on the shuttle then you wait for an hour for the ferry and then you get on the ferry and the Ferry s another hour and then you have to get off the ferry and get on a shuttle to the hotel and it literally my door to hotel room hours you re telling me the people s wedding that this was have done that prior to the wedding and they thought this is fine to have all of our guests do this honestly to do this again I get why they did because it was so beautiful and it s such a nice like Community wedding Vibe you know what I mean like everyone s there and surprisingly I know that they only I know like only three people declined their invites so everybody they invited came and it s such a beautiful island like we re going back we loved yeah we loved it we just we made a mistake and we went the day before we should have made it two days worth of travel so people who knew left on Thursday and then you know got to the fairy town Thursday night and then just took the ferry on Friday so it s like not that big a deal that way but the way we did it and they like rented a car like all these things and it s like in my mind I was I didn t know how much it was going to be to rent a car so I thought it would be cheaper to do the shuttle situation and it s like probably wasn t because it was close to dollars to take all the shuttles wow yeah but you guys had a good time we have the best time Joe was like sitting in the audience like crying and like looking at me like I love you and I was like I got ta take this A A weddings all the time so you guys are wedding people oh we re wedding people you have to get married I think that s what I texted you I was like You Got ta Get Married you re like you have to be a really close friend of mine for me to like want to come enjoy your wedding because it just is a lot to go to people s wedding I mean yeah I get that I also I mean I don t know like Joe and I aren t the like Joe s very social so like sometimes I can see Joe talking to someone and I ll just be like I m gon na go over there and do introvert things by myself you know and like the wedding was so close to our hotel room but like I kept going back to the room for and like touching my face up or like getting whatever I wanted to get like changing my shoes then going back to the wedding like I never felt the burden of like social right and it was fun I mean it s just a big party if you can just get there in your head that it s just a big party then it is fun it just yeah I know like it s a lot of money for whoever s wedding it is it feels like a lot of pressure and then I mean I like it when the ceremonies are short yeah well Shannon s family just seems like the poster children for mental stability because they are so even killed and like chill and like normal and funny and a note like I was more nervous than Shannon I was like are you A A blood she s like no and I was like oh me neither are you nervous she s like no I was like oh me neither but if I faint don t call an ambulance because I don t have health insurance like um but they re like and they re meant to be you know Jordan loves her she loves him he s super funny he practices like oh maybe I shouldn t talk about this online it s not my business okay well it s very funny though and I d like to share it you can t I don t think so it s like rude to do that right fine I mean I don t know I ll tell you privately because it s very funny okay well and then tell us what then you went to San Diego oh and then I went to San Diego to see my baby she s the biggest A A that A A about to be walking and A A going places she s going super cute yeah we she s saying dada too which is just A A rude when she has two moms and I m surprised she s not saying Ryland I could I would die she s right right she s probably watching right now hi Lily hi Lily may I love you he loves you I m trying to get her to call me ZZ why it s easier than Lizzy okay two of the same do you want do you want to look at these alts and um plug any of them or should we just get right into iced tea oh we need a new intro oh yeah I see that every episode WE Post we did first comments is like you need a new intro because you re not in the shed and I was like but to be fair this year we were in the shed for quite a while um but I hear what you re saying I hear you and yeah I think one of these times when you re stay overnight we need to get some footage of us doing like Colorado things yeah hell yeah but also because like I m pounds heavier than when we did that intro and when I watch it I m just like Ugh um yes okay let s do anything dudes okay let s get it I mean well I like young blood I don t know if he s famous or not but you would not think that I would like someone like young blood because it seems like he s trying really hard to be like alternative rocker guy love the guy love young God can you give me an example of one of his songs yeah I played it for you in the car in Colorado oh you re like I like what he s doing with his voice here right I wish he would just keep doing that with his voice there that was your that was your review like do people know who he is I don t know sound off in the comments below I don t know if people know who young blood is and you discovered him through Tick Tock I discovered him through Tick Tock which is why I m like he must be I know he s got money behind him he s like touring and he s like got big A A going on in Japan but like who doesn t you know I m back to hating Tick Tock I just can t consume that I hate it we know okay now moving around tick tock s your toxic lover bro I just wish none of us want this for you I know I wish I liked watching it I can t even like watching it I hate it I hate it yeah okay and I wish you like sushi um uh oh this is important Shane posted on Instagram the other day him doing all those different hairs uh huh does Lady Shane look like me or am I psychotic well are you I think because I like send me a picture as well because when I looked at it I was like is am I because for a minute I was like is that me um or is it is it Ginger I think it might just be the ginger which is kind of um you know what what would you call that when you re saying somebody looks alike just because they have red hair gingerist yeah that s gingerist but I mean I don t know I ll throw the photo up and you guys can determine for yourselves yeah yeah we already covered the fact that I m quitting coffee okay um let s move on to iced tea the Queen s dead yeah rest in peace lady um I don t I m and I m not gon na pretend I know a lot about the Royals but it seems very I don t know if somebody s polarizing is fun yes like it s very much so like NBC ABC all these people are doing these huge tributes and talking about the queen as she s the queen but then you open social media and you feel like oh if you even say anything about the queen you are a horrible person because of things she had supported and I m like but if all these so like are the mainstream networks like out of I just it s hard for me to wrap my head around yeah is what on social media because everyone s mad at everything um yeah I mean you know there s valid reasons to be upset with the monarchy in general and the queen being the you know top of that pyramid scheme is kind of a big deal you know I think we could like in the monarchy to a pyramid scheme in that we hate the person at the top because they ruin the lives of those at the bottoms by just taking everything from them and then uh you know making the people beneath them take everything from the people beneath them and it s just sort of like this awful process where at the bottom row of people is just you know A A it was the hate for them around prior to her death because it seems like all I ever heard is like the US celebrates the Royals like you wouldn t believe like you turn on entertainment news or you go to an entertainment entertainment gossip site and it is Royal Central and I ve always been like why are we so Royal obsessed in the US I ve never given a A A but I believe a big part of it uh right now being so dramatized or not dramatized like I m not trying to call these people drama queen so like the reason why it s so loud right now that people don t like them is because her death is like a spotlight on the issues it s an opportunity to be outspoken about the problems within the monarchy because it s also this period of change right and Elizabeth was a a duty bound woman who gave a A A about the position and the monarchy and upholding whatever the firm I don t know what they call it but she sacrificed a lot for this position her entire life right and then you know King Charles steps in and we all hate Charles because he cheated on Diana who was the people s Queen right princess whatever and he s particularly A A gross like back in the s they leaked all these videotapes of him talking nasty to his current wife Camilla and it s just like who wants to A A that I don t know I ve never been into him he s gross regardless we know for the visuals of the royal boys well they re hideous and the but they re all like also like let s not it s not about their looks it s the it s it s the bigger problem is colonialism and slavery and racism and all of the Nazis like it s it s a deep A A worst things in the world Collide within the royal family that s why people are pissed off right I m not saying they re not valid I just I just was it s interesting to see these huge Publications celebrating the life of and then opening Instagram and seeing some of the things that um the monarchy has done that are horrible and tragic so that I mean every every coin s got two sides I was specific the one thing that I fell for was that they were gon na put her corgis down what there was a hoax or something going around online saying that they were going to put her corgis down because she didn t want them to live past her and I was like well looks like I m going to London and getting in some real A A to save some corgis right now because just like the orcas those corgis will be freed and if it s the last thing I do so um that s not real nobody needs to go get the corgis the corgis are fine they re not gon na clog the corgis or so you think no I m sure they went to one of the royal families okay so you wanted to talk about Jon Hamm s penis again yeah I can t escape it it s just like insane so he addressed the rumors that he prefers going commando because everyone knows he was the Trailblazer for these Tick Tock dick wigglers like if you re thinking of let s not compare Jon Hamm s huge penis to little Huddy dancing like a A A weirdo in his room by himself well I m just saying if we re talking penis visuals through pants I m saying Jon Hamm seemed to be doing it the biggest the first yes yes yes but it s not related to tick tock tick wiggling they re different words you know what I mean so he was on Howard Stern and I guess that he said who doesn t wear underwear and I feel so attacked and I also am calling one of my silent atoms I feel I m like BS this if you I m gon na put the asset on the screen because it s crazy like there s he s like I wear cotton briefs and it s like no I would not be able to see your like I understand like I wear boxes A A you can see like his actual A A dick and there s just no way so he must just enjoy A A with the world which is why I liken it to Tick Tock dick wiggling because they re doing dick wiggling to get a certain amount of attention on the internet and this is no different because if he didn t like the attention he would have seen the first Paparazzi photo gone viral and then he would have stopped doing it but he has a huge tick and he likes showing it off so I wish he would just admit to doing so you think he can help it what do you want John Ham to start tucking before he goes out in public in case the paparazzi s around the corner and he s like these are no I m gon na hurt people I m Gon na Hurt Growers feelings oh no you get offended when I m wearing sweatpants without underwear and those are very you re sick Bro I m a baby and I m saying those are very loose if I were to wear tight pants with A A no underwear and go out in public it s like he knows what he s doing visual assault it s visual assault unless there s people that like it and love it so whatever I mean I call him a liar I think he s a A A liar I don t know what that what if that s not even his dick he s packing you don t even know what he does he s an actor on what oh my God I don t care get mad at me for not knowing Jon Hamm I don t care and I know I know enough and that s that he chose this big tick off in public okay Alexandra Daddario nipple gate during White Lotus win at the Emmys pretty old news but let s talk about it uh so I guess she won and she s wearing a dress what here s the deal back on the Dick showing A A it s like dude I get it like nipples are non offensive or whatever but it s like I don t really want to walk around with my A A nipples showing and it s like sure I ll power to you ladies for having your nipples out but it s like men aren t the only ones who are made uncomfortable by it or aroused like I m uncomfortable seeing nipples I don t want to see your A A nipples A A Kendall or Florence or A A Alexandria we know you guys have great titties in San Diego do you know how many nipples I saw through shirts Ryland and all of them are A A pierced I don t need to know that about a stranger so I think there s a difference one being like if you re just wearing a tank top without a bra and I can like see the outline of your nipples like what Jennifer Aniston would do in friends color I m talking about seeing color and that s but I m liking the no bra to being able to see to Jon Hamm it s not like he s wearing a sheer pant where you can actually visualize or see like the color of the dick but the Florence pews and the other people that are putting their nipples out they want attention for showing their nipple which if they want to free their nipple go for it like all power to you but I do think it s different you know it s like I want you to see my nipples and make comments about them and I don t like it you re okay not into it can t get on board with White Lotus I ve tried so many times I m either four episodes in and every second of it I m like begging myself to like start liking it I m like oh you know what it s just gon na hit me any second then I m just gon na be like this is why everyone s loving this but I turn it on I even tried last night before I even knew this was going to be a topic of yours because it won so many Emmys and I was so bored and I love Sydney Sweeney I love Jennifer Coolidge I love Connie Britton the cast is incredible and their work is phenomenal I love Steve Zahn Steve Zahn is such a A A character little rodent like I can t even handle how deep he gets into these characters and how much on screen he comes across as vulnerably real can t watch the show I just wish I knew what it was that I m missing like you know what I m saying yeah maybe it s taste maybe we re tasteless maybe I m like I m like I watched all of Emily in Paris hated it too though watched every episode hated it well that s the thing like even like with that uncomfortable coupled show like it s obviously like a kitschy show but it it kept my attention throughout where White Lotus I m just like oh my gosh get to something okay so Kim and Ray J ain t that some A A I mean I feel like it s not which is why nobody cares like I know people are writing about it but even and I do feel for Ray J because even if everything he s saying is the truth which I feel that it is I just don t think that it s going to affect the Kardashians in any way because people enjoy watching the Kardashians I do think that what he s saying is probably valid which is Chris had a hand in it they both knew what they were doing they recorded it to release the tape and he was texting Kim what I would be mad about if I was Ray J is Feeling gaslighted by Kim so far after the fact the storyline that they did bring into the first season of the Hulu show to kind of Bring It full circle to the first season of their Kardashian show on E was the sex tape and he really did she really did paint the picture as though like Ray J and his team were gon na leak it again but in the text in the DMS between Kim and Ray J Kim s like you just have to trust the storyline we re going to paint a good picture your way and he s like no you didn t do that at all I started watching the episode I was playing along to go along because I was like yeah let s put this to bed in a nice way and she completely didn t do that and she did it with a smile on her face and then it s like yeah I would post it with fake Tears In Her Eyes fake tears in her eyes but then talking to him on DM s just like keep it calm like yeah she is so famous and has so much weight in Hollywood and people are so entertained by her and she s already famous for a sex tape this isn t going to be damaging to her in any regard but what bothers me in a way is she doesn t even have to address it she gets to stay silent she doesn t ever have to acknowledge it she just gets to move along like nothing happened why Ray J feels like his whole life is uprooted and then to poke him again on The Late Show after he feels Chris manufactured this helped with the contracts pushed this forward and listen I love the Kardashians and I m still gon na watch the premiere in a couple of days when it airs I and it s not gon na affect them at all I just like I do feel for Ray J a little bit oh yeah because they re also painting him as like a villain like being so vague about why he has this and all that stuff in the public narrative makes it seem as though he filmed her without her consent which is you know a version of assault and all like it s just it s A A you both agreed to it you re both willing participants everybody consented to it to the degree of which contracts exists don t call a man a A A abuser if he s not abusing just don t do that it s a big deal and then to film and to say like oh yeah she looks better in this take and he has the contracts that they both did yeah like I m shocked that it s not more of a scandal than it is because I feel if it wasn t the Kardashians it would be career ruining for another someone else yeah well here s what I want to know is the lie detector test guy from James Corden the same guy that you know yes used him multiple times and he does everyone s and while he is a legit polygraph lie detector guy he also knows entertainment is number one you know like he knows when he s on a production he knows how to make a moment you can use the moment or not if you want um he will show you the facts and you can use the facts if you want but he also will do what the production wants if asked you know what I mean right so he ll lie yeah you think he lied oh I don t know maybe Chris is I I don t I also don t think polygraph tests are all in all adding a syllable it s probably oh well polygraph test yeah I don t think they re accurate and I I would say Chris if anyone could keep it cool enough to pass yeah um some interrogation because I think Chris lives on beta blockers she has she s a mastermind of her generation like she has created and maintained Fame for her family which while impressive I don t know that I could I don t I don t know that I could do what she does which is why they say the devil works hard and Kris Jenner Works harder you know oh yeah she does but good for her and good for the family for doing what they continue to do you know I mean yeah they have what they want which is attention and fame and are you gon na get the Kris Jenner by Kylie palette the second one the martini one no okay are you no they I was honestly annoyed by myself promotion was shoved in my face by it like I and I just I don t wear makeup unless I m getting in drag so yeah but it was like overkill on the promotion you know and I couldn t escape it I loved it um okay you put in the scream star teas the upcoming sixth installment of the franchise um she said it s gon na be times more mortifying doesn t that seem like the wrong use of that word to you I mean you re talking to somebody who uses every word wrong right but like even you doesn t it feel wrong right well I mean I think she just means like scary disturbing haunting right which is not what mortifying means what does mortifying mean look it up okay well are you gon na talk while I do this I know this is all I wanted to talk about I just think it s a funny choice of the word she s like it s embarrassed like it s super embarrassing yeah it causes great embarrassment or shame I guess I thought mortifying was different than it actually is too yes that s weird so it s weird the situations are more embarrassing than well then well her backing it up says it s awful because you all you see how in a city like New York everyone is kind of doing their own thing and someone is screaming for help and no one will come for their help I don t think she knows what mortified means I mean I don t either so I ll give her that like I would have thought that made sense to me until I looked up the different definition of mortifying when I was looking for articles I was like full stop what and it s also like after this woman like no offense like honestly was the weakest link of that film she played the big sister do you remember that big speech she had in the hospital about like my dad was Sydney s A A first killer boyfriend not Stu what was his name Jenny Ortega should have been the star uh yeah I mean but and now This Woman s cup she s replacing Nev Campbell and they re not paying Neve Campbell that you know what s mortifying that that I will say I am excited to see Hayden Panettiere because in a comeback I think she s a wonderful actress but she has really had a crazy Road I think she had really have you did you see all the headlines that she like came back to people yeah um so I am very I m rooting for her and I hope that she s always rooting for Hayden same love her so much um are you the A A me that s what you said well you said I am the A A but you can t stop laughing well so you saw that post Malone eat A A on stage yeah yeah and I re this angle I saw was too zoomed out I re watched the fall like six times and I still can t determine what was the cause of the oh he fainted no he didn t faint I just I m laughing because I m thinking about it and that s why I m the A A and then I tried watching his like so hard it is yeah I I mean was he fine I tried watching his minute long explanation about it and it was just so slow paced and boring that I was like I feel for the man for falling and I hope he s okay but I could not well I could not endure the explanation you know I mean I just I feel bad because and it s like and it s a gnarly situation to be in because like God man what a nightmare to fall that publicly that hard and he s gasping I mean great publicity I mean yeah it went on for they cut the music and then it just goes on and on and on oh man yeah he s fine but this is he was on stage the next night but it s like this is my response every time someone Falls and it s like I mean because it s hilarious yes yeah I mean it s hilarious is Demi still doing her tour why did she fall I don t know but I don t know why I started thinking about Demi Lovato okay um well I don t know do we you want to do movie reviews yeah I want to know did you see that one about the girl who goes on the stupid radio tower and can t get down I ve been waiting to see that it wasn t at the movie theater we like to see um so we re waiting until the end of this month when it comes on video on demand did you go see it yeah and that s awful it s the stupidest A A I ve ever seen in my life I mean but is it suspenseful like is it fun because there s a lot of those movies stupid it s insanely stupid you sit there the whole time like oh my God these A A are dumb as A A I thought the trailer was great did you did you go see it I don t see a trailer no I just saw because we had it at home and it had like a Rotten Tomatoes rating I m gon na see it I even though you said it was a flop I m gon na watch it at home I m glad I won t see it at a theater though now that I you should see Barbarian instead I ve seen it I told you I saw that and you didn t die I literally no I told you you glazed over it because obviously you didn t see it because Shane did force me to go and see that I don t like seeing scary movies I loved it I loved it because not only is it like it s just it s at the scary meter that is good for me but then it also like takes multiple different turns that take you out of the scariness and just drives a good storyline and I just I couldn t have loved it more for what it was I walked out and I was like wow I like thoroughly enjoyed myself I didn t exactly know it was gon na happen and once um who s the the guy the actor in it Justin Long yeah loved his like whole character Arc I just oh it was fantastic I yeah I really loved it I thought it was so fun I thought it was perfectly stupid like I was laughing but I was scared and it was great Justin long does a good job of playing a guy who s alone you know what I mean and dude he plays on such I I love how it like plays on culture today and then shows I I mean I don t want to ruin the movie yeah don t ruin it don t A A ruin it I won t ruin it I won t be a spoiler and then um when we get to TV uh did you start selling the OC come on Lizzy no I haven t had time bro but why d you give the disgusted face you liked getting into selling Sunset I know I just haven t had time okay I love it I have time I love it and the drama is even more so real like it felt real and I was telling my aunt because she also watches selling Sunset and we kind of Converse about it so I was like oh you got to get into the OC one because the drama like I feel like I m selling Sunset it evolved over time to like oh the show has to be dramatic so it seems like everyone s trying to get their dramatic screen time whereas on this show it felt like a lot of it was real and it turns out now that the show s over so one of the Realtors kind of playing parallel to like how crucial was dating Justin Hartley Justin Hartley was this big This Is Us star they got a divorce um one of the guys they have guys on selling the OC he was married he was married to Brittany Snow and all of the Realtors are on the show are flirting all the time he s like a very good looking charismatic guy and it it was like too far almost and now it s come out weeks after the show aired that they got a divorce and yeah like it had to be due to the show the response to the show I don t think she likes that he s on a reality show I don t think he she likes how he was not only being flirted with all the time but kind of entertaining the flirting yeah um so very fascinating on a lot of fronts and then I wanted to know like you brought up your beef with the guy that does the rehearsal on multiple occasions I just want to know why you have such an interesting I don t know him dude I don t I don t really know him oh I just like it s like it s like English accents or like British accents like I just can t A A with it I don t think he has one I don t care it s like he is like for me like my brain shuts off with English accents are just like oh I can t hear that I think it s so I hear like I hear Nathan for you and I m like oh I can t hear that and so this is his new iteration of a show which is he creates rehearsals for big scenarios in people s lives and it just Shane liked it in a way that like we both liked it but Shane thought it was like funny because every time you think it couldn t get crazy like more weird he gets so much more weird at the expense of hundreds of thousands of dollars and every time I m I m entertained but I m like what the A A like what and Shane thinks it s so funny and I m like I get why it s funny but it doesn t make me laugh out loud but I m still entertained so Shane s like you take everything too serious well that s my problem with it because I do think I take him a little bit too seriously and I feel as though sometimes when he does these stuns it s at not just a financial cost but at the cost of a human being because at the core of this are real people right yes and there s only I think one person that s actually maybe affected I think in the end most people it does wrap around to something that is heartwarming and they re like the outcome is for the better although he is manipulating situations it yeah and that s why I enjoyed it because it s a mind A A on multiple levels and then I think he does towards the end of this realize that what he s doing might not be the most morally right so it s interesting because they have announced another season is coming so it s like is he what s it going if he kind of had this aha moment what the next season of this going to be uh I d need a big aha moment because I m I m not terribly interested in watching someone be the butt of a joke and not know it for an hour you know what I mean like that that makes me very A A uncomfortable and I m just like can t do this it s just like I can t enjoy Sea World now all I can focus on is that my upper lip is supposed to be flipped yes baby I m taking you to Kelly she s gon na make it right no your upper lip is beautiful I m being an A A oh well thank you very much really good advice submissions but I think I want to give them like the the time they deserve and you ll be here on Sunday we re gon na film a couple more episodes well yeah next week we ll be together we re gon na film a couple more episodes I think we ll save these juicy questions because I think they really hit on some things that will hit home for a lot of people including us personally I think we can work through some of our own problems with other people s problems so just stopping

dressed me as well we just didn t go like have our closet moment together which i m fine about you and jared should have those moments together thank you i m really proud of us for uh breaking down stereotypes yeah breaking them during baby we should get Laughter you have a good way of maintaining the sound i have a very hard time unless it s a bunch of herbs we need to do it okay what about your outfit shane thank you finally um no i bet this is a typical you know little jacket to remind us of the la couch that i missed so much and then a little britney spears shirt and um yeah you can t see from what s under the the legs down is really bad the shoulders look really it looks like you like work out wow this is so annoying i m not even kidding i m saying it s annoying because like he wants that compliment and then you gave it to him and now it s like i m the bad boyfriend i want any call oh my god no i m just like what do you mean do you know what i mean how it has that cut or it like there s certain blazers injected when i wear it i m like oh i look like actually work out today chris is trying to A A both of us tonight he literally i walk down i m like sitting down into the set and he goes every time ryland wears blue i just can t stop looking at him it s true every time this is a weird turn of events no wait okay okay keep going look in his eyes right now when he wears blue do his eyes not pop and is he not the most beautiful thing you ve ever seen wow wow but that smells good wow okay what do you think about jared come on chris jared i said this earlier he s just the coolest person here by far that s just physical no with whether what he wears his swag his attitude all of it it s okay even though it s that compliment in a high regard is that a burberry jacket it looks like it because he s so cool Music do you know what i m saying like he s just effortlessly cool i mean yes yes but i mean you didn t give him like a physical compliment that jacket it was included in that you know what um here s what i think i just cracked the curd i think the truth i think the current spurs are i think the truth is that you because jared is technically more of your type than we are that you re like nervous to give him a compliment because it s too real know cause it s not gay with me and shane are getting dressed maybe possibly because what i m saying is dude like what is chris gon na A A i know noticed him no every week i i i take it up a bar and i m like let s get you the crazy rejection tonight you were like i m like yeah it s got ta work jared s just dressing for chris yeah that s common when you have a crush you like really have to think about what you re gon na wear what s happening chris is cool he s from peru his peruvian facts are fun for me and you chris yes i heard but you have a special peruvian fact and it might involve your co host yeah okay so all right so uh oh i m sorry oh sorry my ranch game so my peruvian fact has to do with alpacas because alpacas are like a pretty big part of peruvian culture and i didn t really know why growing up i just know that like on every like peruvian like merchandise if you go there like every beanie hat shirt that i ever bought from there always had alpacas on it and they re just kind of like on everything everywhere i think they re on the flag they re are they see i m a terrible proven i didn t notice if it was um are we really debating on whether or not we think there s an alpaca the peruvian flag there s no A A way we ll get to that in a second that could be the most offensive thing i ever said if there is one there s no way i ll pack on their flag in my brain i m like if it s like tiny and hidden in the in the middle of the thing anyways okay that s cool so my proven fact is that three quarters of the world s alpaca population live in peru which means that there are more than million alpacas in peru and since pre inca times uh they have been and still are a big part of peruvian culture and yeah oh wow okay you guys are about to be shook what i m about to airplay something for you oh i know exactly i A A told you there s an alpaca on the flag there is is that the actual flag or the crest that s the flat it says flag of peru the most offensive thing i ve ever said of course there s an alpaca on the A A flag and a tree and a cornucopia through the loom mandela effect you know what s so funny is like i like peruvia so much more now i ve seen i love that i like peruvia that s offensive peruvian i ve seen the peruvian flags so many times growing up i know the crest in the middle but i ve never thought what s in it until just now this is such a cute flag wow thank you that s so nice wow good fact chris okay so i was thinking about this today and you know because i ve been thinking about having kids you know and how are we gon na you know do certain things what what rituals are we gon na create what little memories are we gon na do what are we gon na do for their birthdays because like when i was a kid i had some good birthdays some terrible birthdays i feel like our childhood was very up and down in a lot of ways yes our birthday situation i remember when we were very young i mean it was like A A extreme we had a dunk tank at one time a bounce house at one time this was like very early on it would be like all the neighbors were over you know all of our friends would come over but i want to say those stopped relatively early uh maybe i don t know i how many well we had two or three of those i think cause then they got divorced and money was gone so yeah that was like nine yeah cause i mean then i had a birthday where it pretty much was just driving to hollywood and looking at hollywood and getting like a cd and then try getting food and then going back still fun i mean it s still great sounds better yeah i mean oh rylan what was your uh birthday situation when you were your kid oh my parents went all out because my brother and i are three days apart and my brother and my dad are born on the same day so we would always have theme parties it d either be like a scientist would come over and we d have all these tables and we d all do scientists ex like you know like explosions or whatever that would be really fun or we d have like uh characters from our favorite movie like you know like whatever there d always be like themes and then the cakes would revolve around the themes but my brother and i would get different cakes like about it s so crazy that this exists like your life is like a movie yeah they did put on a good production for our childhood i will say did you feel like the parties were for the kids more than the parents because i feel like our parties were also like pretty paranoid i was a and you know what i m saying i know that i think our parents watch this so i don t want to shade them too much but looking back it was giving like and i know they weren t i m not starting a rumor it was given swinger vibes because i just remember being nine i just hated because i don t like people too many people so i d be hiding the whole time and then i would just remember hearing really loud A A music and just like drunk drunk A A adults you know and we weren t allowed to come outside after like a certain time it s like your birthday party is staying and look and there was like a dj and A A it they went all out and you imagine if like would they be the kind of people that would have an only fans right now yes oh my god now it d be celebrated they d be millionaires you know all the times how they changed they would because i found mom s like sexy pictures that she would take with you kidding she showed them to me oh my god well those were his favorite pictures so i i enjoyed i enjoyed going to ventura i got ta go i was trying to see if they re taking pictures Laughter uh okay what was yours uh just to add on to that by the way i barely remember those big outrageous birthdays there was only a couple of them maybe it was only like two and that s why i don t remember many birthdays and i don t think we made very big deals about them you know what i just did remember one birthday and okay this is probably why i blocked them all out because i remember i remember me and mom went to the beach to the pier i was probably like you know and we got ice cream and then we were sitting eating ice cream and an older woman walked up and said uh you ladies having fun and then and then uh she walked away and i was confused and mom started laughing and i said what she s like she thinks that we re lesbian and then i laughed so hard that i peed my pants uh on a bench with my mom on my birthday just two big old lesbians having so much good i was misgendered all the way up until i was honestly i was misgendered in my s you act like in actuality my whole childhood was uh ma am uh miss little missy um because i had long hair and tits and i have pretty face and pretty face big waist and um and me and my mom were you know conjoined at the hip basically hanging out all the time going you know country western places and you know line dancing and we just look like two big A A my whole life yeah and then in my s after i lost weight and i was on youtube and i was like it wasn t a date but it kind of was a date and like you know we were walking around knott s berry farm and we were getting candy or something and then the lady behind the shelf was just like um miss you re not allowed to do that or whatever she s talking to me i was misgendered well your hair was my i had a long similar hairstyle to you as well and i d walk into subway with my mom and they d be like what do you ladies want today that happened to you too yeah i mean not my whole life only in my like era of skater boy where i i went i went too drastic with the hair where it was like shoulder length and then my bangs would swoop down and around i remember crying the first time that somebody called me sir i was at petco you weren t used to it no it had never happened and i was at petco and um they were bagging our stuff and then the guy was just like oh here you go sir and i was walked to the parking lot and i started crying and mom was like what s wrong i m like he called me sir and then she just hugged me and she was like thank you jesus and i knew it would happen because we ve been waiting because literally it s not a joke i was called and then when i started a new high school everybody thought i was a girl the teacher would think i was a girl i ll show pictures like i i look like a A A you know big old A A i think it s called bbw actually okay because drake says i like my girl s bbw so thick everybody this is so thick everyone in the room so uncomfortable that was me um well everyone chris what A A drake knows everything he really does uh drake or drake drake is everyone hey drake chris what was your birthday s like um my parents always did everything they could for me i mean they re the best parents ever but at different stages of my life we were at different financial points you know and there were times where they couldn t do a lot and when they could they did everything they could you know like i have the most amazing parents ever but i mean there were times when i was younger where there was just no money you know it was tough but um but they always made it feel special and i always felt loved and happy you know oh well i think we re all going to be good dads are we all going to be dads do you guys want to be dads i would definitely want to be a dad you want to be a dad yeah it d be cool to have a mini me no Laughter oh chris found out an interesting fact today what that the dentist can tell if you ve recently sucked a dick because it leaves a bruise on the roof of your mouth no wow what does it look like the bruise uh i can show you there s a video that i saw so i was sent a video from my friend rick wait what kind of dick sucking are they doing to be getting a bruise yeah are they bruised well i guess it s just because you have such a soft palate that i know but doesn t the dick go towards the throat like that s a conspiracy like it s not when i m sucking a dick it s not going yeah but it should it should i don t know lightly touch it uh and maybe maybe it s really cool they re right here so if i don t know do you want to see the video somebody sucking a dick no of a dentist talking about yeah but what about if you re eating a popsicle oh he just cracked the conspiracy because not just dicks because wooden i mean i ve never eaten a popsicle let s say that you know but is it much different i saw and take care of that oh my gosh if you just suck a wiener is it true yeah that one s true how because you can see bruising shut i m still curious if a popsicle does the same thing but it looks like you really got to be jamming the A A back you know what i mean well no i think they re not jamming it back enough i think if you were more of like going for the deep throat that wouldn t happen this is like hitting the top i don t know this girl s bad at giving head that s all i m gon na say how many days like how long after you suck a dick does that stay there for her i don t know but my friend said crystal in your mouth my friend sent me that and like so many of my diaz are dentists and i m just like does everyone am i do did they know every time i ever gave that i m horrified now whoa i would like to try this we should report back right now right go in the other room real quick suck a dick and then show your mouth i feel like that s a lot with my brother here well i m just curious i don t i okay i ll do some research for the next podcast but i don t think so that would honestly that would be great anything to get you to do that oh my gosh research for a podcast whatever we got to call it you re kidding i do that way more than you do that to me you re kidding me oh my god yeah perfect timing i can t even believe that you just said that what i would say that you get it more than the average person i don t know i don t think so no no and that s no well this is i feel like this is too much can we segue into a different topic so we can get away from this addiction yes you want to go straight in wait a minute yes addiction it kind of kind of could correlate some people were addicted to sucking dick i would say chris earlier so oh that s wow what a great A A subway that was i wasn t even planning it it happened sometimes you re very good at this you re so delicious thank you yeah you really are earlier you know we were standing around the kitchen we were like what should we talk about today and then i was like you know i kind of want to talk about addiction because i ve struggled with it in many forms jared has had some history with it rylan s had some and i said chris what have you been addicted to and you uh what d you say well sex maybe i don t know like not officially you said dicks but yes oh dicks you re right yeah yeah so how are you addicted to sex because right it s a sex addict and just to confirm like you re addicted to pleasuring penises i mean not just like you don t collect penis molds and nothing like that you know it s not like a A A you know knick knack situation are we using addiction a little loosely because i think like if chris was a true sex addict i don t think you d be able to focus on your everyday tasks no like so i think we re saying like addiction but it s things that we have obsessions that s so funny that in the middle of the word is what you re addicted to but but there are times like i used to edit for this new media company in downtown and just in the middle of doing my job i just like had to i m so sorry for any family listening please stop listening i had to jack off so i would run to the bathroom is that why you go to our bathroom so much no but i d be honest because i ve thought about it i was i like stopped listening because i was thinking about the dentist thing did you just say you jerk off in our bathroom oh my gosh shane where have you been he s talking about in the bathroom window peeking in without his masturbation station i d be sitting there editing and i m just like i need to come right now so i would go what would happen would you be editing and it s like chubber comes on you re like okay or something are you editing attention are you editing no i m editing the most boring nothing like video i don t think i ve ever felt that urgency to come that s what i m saying like i think i don t know i don t think i m an addict necessarily but it s definitely higher of a drive than a normal person i would say you re more addicted to relationships right well yeah i feel like being in a relationship i can t have oh i don t want to have sex when i m not in a relationship but i don t know i m just in my mind i m just how often are you doing that jerking off well when i m in a relationship i m just having a lot of sex but when i m single like multiple times a day so wow whoa yeah so if you re like is it just always at the crib in the stage or he was just telling us it s at work too and that s why i had asked if he s jacked up very rarely single so what is this like also this is a warning you need to be careful about where you jerk off because i read an article i didn t fully read it so but i read an article and a guy was jerking off in a plane and now and he got arrested and now he s a sex offender what what i know wait in a bathroom or on in the seat i didn t i didn t fully read it okay just to add on that tip something that we ve talked about in the past is that s also why it s important just to pee in your car don t pull over and pee on the side i think peeing in your car is still exposed i mean i think you can cover it better and it s it d be a lot harder for a cop to see you doing it as opposed to you peeing on the side of the road though you know what i mean where s the weirdest place you jerked off i don t know i mean there s so many buttons he s like right now um i just uh are you like are you like a connoisseur of like crazy jackoff spots or like no i m again i m just horny a lot like this is weird to me i m sorry i m answering it it s not weird at all but weirdest spot i got a ferris wheel parks one time i was like i realized i was near a church and that made me feel bad it was like a parking lot um i don t know like what played your card probably one time i did it while driving up a road that was really dangerous and i almost crashed um okay okay anyways um so your guys addictions huh yeah no that you re so brave yeah yeah um that was good uh okay we can add one last thing though i am so in a relationship i would like i ve just made it sound like i m starting all the time i m very i just want to be clear i m like the most monogamous human i wouldn t okay anyways okay yeah um and you said you were in the last episode you said you were a shooter right yeah so like you re shooting on the windshield no i had a shirt it s messy in the car okay anyways this is very A A weird yeah i don t know how to segway also semi a workaholic is something that that s a segway okay my addictions are so this is so this the reason i brought this up earlier about talking addiction all right i m done you have any more questions Laughter um is last night i would say i had a mini uh not breakdown but there was a situation last night because i i have felt myself getting really back into my workaholic vibe which is like all consuming i m obsessed with this podcast wanting to make it perfect wanting to edit it there s a lot that goes into it and um it kind of started consuming my life and then i noticed that ryland he was like you re becoming a workaholic again and i miss you and i don t understand and i m trying to figure out how to balance that and not get because when i become a workaholic when i get back in my A A it is bad like i don t eat i don t sleep uh my face falls apart i don t leave the house i don t see anyone like it s it s really really bad so i don t really have any tips i guess i m asking right now for them does anybody in this room have tips for how to conquer before the tips i think this is an overarching uh theme in your life so it s not only work is what you re the most passionate about so it comes out the strongest and it s the most intense but you are this way in a lot of elements like if you have emails in your inbox you can t focus until it s cleared if we move you can t focus until the house is decorated like you re a very all or nothing person and that s like a recurring theme in your life right yeah yeah i think it s just about finding a balance you know because it s understandable because you want to work and do as much as you can you want to be productive and i think especially like for me and you from our upbringing it s also very important to make sure that you re staying busy and all of that so you can provide for your family but on the flip side of that providing for your family also entails that you have a family that needs you and other other avenues and other arenas you know so if you only contribute one aspect to that relationship then you re going to suffer in others and you know that s why i say there s a balance you know find find moments to prioritize both sides and it s going to be a little sacrifice possibly but you re going to realize that after making a little sacrifice the outcome isn t as devastating as you might have thought it s maybe even going to make it happier when you get your work accomplished because you have that full rounded relationship that s even healthier and full of happier moments so that s that d be my advice and obviously it s not healthy to not work at all but we did have i mean after a while after we found our footing again and stuff we did get closer than ever we had so much fun and it s not that i don t want you to work but then when this podcast starts it is like this is such a big production produce the show schedule the show film the show edit the show promote the show thumbnail everything it s like but at the same time i still want to have a life outside of work because we ve learned what putting all our eggs in one basket being work does and it s not healthy it s not conducive for a happy healthy life yeah i mean especially now that we you know we re planning on having a kid like we actually hopefully fingers crossed we have a surrogate by the end of summer so then we ll have a baby in may next may i mean yeah best case scenario scenario but yeah uh i need to figure it out i need to figure out a nice balance with work and family because yeah once we have a baby i my addiction is gon na be wanting to be the best dad ever which actually is probably also a bad thing because then then it s just too much i mean i think you just copter dad if you do anything you do it all the way like and that just is what it is i don t know the solution i genuinely don t and that s not that s the problem well see you guys in a minute let s take a break no i m kidding uh no there is really no solution i m going to keep talking about in therapy but i think it is good to talk about it um you have a more i don t know how much you re willing to talk about this i don t want to make you feel weird but you have more of a i mean dude to be honest with you if we re just kind of lining up the topics i him talking about driving up a little bit scratching well he s jacking off nothing s too crazy you know nothing could be too much whatever you want to talk about man i can t i can t get more personal than that so but yeah so i mean really it d be drugs for the most i mean i guess i could say i m a workaholic too but i m really addicted to anything anything that i enjoy anything that puts me in it puts me in my own moment with it so when i was younger i think we talked about it one time like the first time i smoked weed and all that but uh i started smoking weed at a pretty young age which i don t think weed is bad necessarily but i think developing a habit that you become reliant on at an early age because there s a lot of people that could just smoke or have a drink and that s pretty much it but once my brain registers that life seems better if i m doing something or like um i m able to alter my mood in a way that makes things more bearable whatever the case may be so regardless but i think starting at a young age developing those patterns and then as i got older i started drinking a lot which was bad uh i got like a couple dui s which isn t cool but if we re gon na kind of narrow it down the worst thing that i ever got into was definitely uh cocaine that was that was like a real bad look so uh one night i was just hanging out with friends and we were looking for a different drug which uh we re looking for mushrooms actually at the time and uh the dude that we called didn t have that but he had cocaine i had never tried it never had the idea that i wanted to try it i was more into chilling out and tripping out but we did it i loved it we ended up going to parties until like six in the morning to the point where we went to someone s house because they said that they had a party there that night and everybody in the house was sleeping you know what i m saying and we walked around the whole house it was very A A weird you know what i mean and seeing if anybody had more coke wow yes but i did this for years you know and for a while there i would do that and drink to the point where one time i drank and i did so much of it and i passed out um from like days and days of not sleeping and i woke up in a outdoor pond in an apartment complex you know that s kind of A A weird but for me it was just all consuming you know and it s like every moment all i could think about is if i wasn t on it when i could get it and that was really dangerous and thank god i was able to get out of it you know and how did you get out of that what was like your rock bottom moment how did you get out of it uh my rock bottom moment was to go back real quick um because this is a the type of moment that becomes very common is when you do a drug like cocaine it does something to your brain where you re really really wired up for x amount of time it could be depending on how pure it is and all these other variables it could be minutes or it could be hours and hours and hours but as soon as it wears off there s a come down where you just feel A A miserable you know you feel depressed because it s very easy to be energetic to be happy to be all of these things when you re on that drug so when you re off of it it just like drains all the dopamines so the first night when i was telling you we went to like a A A house and walked around like idiots uh when i got home that night i laid on the couch i couldn t go to sleep i had work in like you know three hours and the only thing i could think of doing to relax me to put me to sleep was listening to sarah mclachlan music i kind of love that so like i was laying there thinking about sarah like listen to A A sarah mclachlan but um that was a common occurrence though coming home at a certain point you know i would try to take a bunch of nyquil or something and all this stuff when i really hit rock bottom is i started just really neglecting my family like really you and mom and i think before that you know i would really make an effort and i would really try but it became all consuming i would avoid phone calls i wasn t present i was A A up at work and one it was a combination of a few things is on my nd birthday i uh i was at my buddy s house and i had a split shift at work where you would work from like eight to twelve and then four to eight so i had four hours where i can go out and do whatever i wanted so i went to my buddy s house and we did a bunch of uh drugs then i went back to work and mom also worked for the company that we were with and when i went back she was there everybody even people that didn t work that day came they had all the all the favorite snacks that i come in when i you know because in the morning i d usually come in like high on weed with the munchies and i d buy all these little snacks and A A like that so they bought all those snacks they had birthday cake they had sodas and all these things and the unfortunate part really was or not unfortunate part i mean i put myself in the predicament but you don t want to eat when you re doing those drugs you know you re not like super hungry so i couldn t eat anything it would actually make me sick to think about eating and everybody was singing happy birthday to me uh the other thing about doing all drugs are gon na make your eyes look different like if you smoke weed you know your eyes are gon na droop a little bit they might get red but when you do hard drugs your pupils get really big and they re very sensitive it s hard to keep your people steady it s hard to maintain you don t want to maintain eye contact because all i could think is they re going to look at my pupils so i walked into this room full of people people that actually cared you know mom was there they had cakes and i couldn t eat anything i couldn t look into anybody s eyes i just felt horrible about that and then it wasn t long after that that i got home really late one night and it was just like a weird night you know because the deeper you get into A A like that you might start off doing it with your buddy you know like me and chris might start off doing it together but chris is might be the kind of person that gets to a point where he s like i m straight on all this A A bro like i just want to go back to like doing what i m doing and i don t want to keep doing drugs so i m gon na have to find people that are more into it than chris and it s gon na get deeper and deeper for me i m gon na end up living you know i m gon na end up basically going to that s why crack houses exist because because it gets to that point where you know and i find myself in a lot of bad environments and all that and it was getting like very unluxurious and i came home one night and uh when we were younger when we were going through it for christmas we would like take trade offs so one year you would get let s say a hundred dollar gift and i would get like a couple things and the next year it would be the opposite vice versa and one of those years where it was my turn to kind of take the smaller gift i remember i got pringles hair gel and like a patch that had the kurt cobain uh suicide note on it and that was it you know and i came home one night and it was just a weird night and i felt funky about it i mean i think i had gone to a ranch in compton with this guy and like this weird A A and i got home and there was a can of pringles with a note and it was for mom and it just put me in my feelings really bad you know and i think it was like the next day that i asked her to have lunch with me and i just pretty much told her i was like mom she knew i smoked weed i think it was obvious to like anyone that knows me that like you know i smell weed but she had no idea that i was getting that heavy into stuff so i admitted it to her and i think if she would have like made it because we were at a restaurant i kind of planned it out like i don t we can t make a scene at a restaurant i guess then again she probably would make it if you know she wouldn t carry it people make scenes at restaurants right so she didn t she was totally cool about it you know she just told me she understood and you know she s a human too and i think she s able to relate in certain ways to it after that we started going to a rehab class i i don t know if it was like that day when i quit but i remember that i just like couldn t do it anymore i looked at it in a different manner like now it gave me anxiety like i couldn t even think about it and it took a little bit of time but uh since then i mean i haven t drinking alcohol on like A A probably since i was or i haven t done hard drugs since then but i saw a lot of people ruin their lives you know a lot of people because the other thing about drugs is once one thing doesn t get you the fix once you know one shot doesn t get you drunk you got to take two and you know and i m also very blessed um i feel blessed that i didn t get into it in a time like right now you know because right now i think like people died of fentanyl you know and with there being such a high demand for drugs and so many people wanting to find ways to make money very easily uh there s a lot of fake drugs on the market i mean look like mac miller died because of fake drugs and all these people we lost so i have no doubt in my mind that would have appealed to me you know if i had a buddy that just so happened that night instead of mushrooms he had fentanyl laced something or another because i would take anything you know i took a pill one time a guy gave me and i passed out for like two days it ended up being what they give psych ward patients when they come in you know so like that i think that was the last time i took a pill i didn t know what it was so really that was it and then just trying to find other places to put my my focus and my energy you know because you got ta if you re an addictive person you can t have nothing going on you know you got ta have something where you can focus that energy like stuff like aaa and all that it s good to look at other people in different stages of addiction you know you feel a little bit less alone because if you just feel like a A A up and you don t ever when you re a real A A up and everyone around just seems to have it together it makes you feel way worse you know but if you re a A A up and you realize that it s not like as uncommon as you thinking there s even groups of people that are willing to share experiences about it and help you through it uh that helps but yeah that was pretty much it you know it s interesting to me too that you mentioned like cocaine being so negative because i ve always been so terrified of specifically cocaine mainly because i remember growing up hearing about like winnie houston and dmx and mac miller like dying from cocaine so or at least being involved in some way potentially from what i understood um and then also in high school uh there was a party where a girl i knew not really well but i knew her um she did cocaine for the first time at a party died and then the people at the party didn t know what to do with her and we found out days later they like drove down a road and dumped her body and bushes and so i ve had like all these terrifying things like cocaine specifically terrifies me but in hollywood and like our industry it s like such a common thing and people do an act like i m crazy when i m scared of it but that i had so i ve talked about this before in a video a while ago but i had a friend in high school actually i think i started with him in fifth grade and then we kind of went to each school together we weren t super close or anything but you know he was in my class so i knew him pretty well and he was i think he was valedictorian and then like a few years after high school uh i heard a rumor that he was in jail for murdering someone and i was like what and i looked into it and yeah in a drug fueled you know rage he killed his uncle and did you hear about this and then he took the body and burned it and like it was the whole thing he s in jail now and it s just and so a question can you do something like murder or like something you know less crazy than that and it really is the drugs it s not a direct effect of the uh it s not the high that the drug is producing okay if you take pcp or something like that that s like a disassociative the uh makes you hallucinate i mean there s people one guy in particular like cut off his penis and jumped off a building it s a pretty famous story i forget the gentleman s name uh chris i m sure you could look it up rapper cuts off penis and gem soft building it s a cautionary tale though you know i think anyone hearing that probably doesn t want to smoke pcp if they ve never tried it but what happens is when you do these hard drugs you re going to get you know days and days and days without sleep and you re going to get sleep deprivation and then if you have sleep deprivation and you re trying to fuel yourself with these drugs you have a psychotic break you ll see things that aren t there you ll hear voices i m sure we ve all seen in movies like drug addicts looking through their window thinking someone s watching out at them and all this stuff so depending on how strong you know those effects get you could definitely have a psychotic break and kill somebody like very easily and then you and i m not i don t want to scare people like there s all kinds of out there they re going to kill people but if you have any like kind of dark thoughts naturally and you stretch yourself to the limit with sleep deprivation and and and drugs like that for sure i mean it could happen the rapper you re referring to by the way is andre johnson is he alive yeah i think so so he cut off his dick jumped out of a window and he survived did they have to reconstruct i mean it wasn t the th floor and you know what i mean i think he jumped off like a three story building which is very survivable he probably A A his legs up or something what happened to the penis the winner uh i want did he flush it down the toilet what he like did something with it what do you do i mean there s interviews he s on a bunch of like interviews listen if you want to get teenagers to not do drugs tell them A A like that like when they used to come to our schools and be like you know oh you re A A this is what your brain looks like and this is what your lungs look like no tell me i m gon na cut my dick off and throw it in the toilet i would never do drugs doctors were not able to reattach the penis so did they do you think they just had to reconstruct a way for the pee to get out i don t know and just a little context because i know a little bit about that story the reason he did that is because he felt like his penis was ruining his life whoa because his penis was the driving force behind every bad decision that he s ever made okay so he was a sex addict probably i mean he didn t talk about it he did talk about jack but i mean so that s that s that you know wow well thank you for sharing all that i mean i mean listen but everything happens for a reason and uh it does and look at what you re able to do here i mean talking about this i think honestly i even as funny as it sounds even just you telling that story about somebody cutting their dick off is gon na stop people from doing drugs like literally a hundred percent like i m never doing drugs because i always kind of fantasized about you know maybe i would you know be more creative or maybe i would have more fun maybe maybe i would be you know whatever maybe i d be skinnier if i did coke like i would always have those thoughts um so yeah now i m definitely never gon na do it so thank you you re the first person to tell me how cool i was oh wait who s cooler me or jared jerry s the coolest person oh my god i agree but who s the sexiest next year don t answer that okay so before we get into the glitches in the matrix which is really what i want to focus on today i do have a couple theories that are stupid but it made me it made me think i m gon na throw this out and you tell me how crazy this is i think i m gon na hate it there is a theory that the government created dinosaurs to keep us from trying to event time travel okay okay okay how about this i m in i ve actually made a video before about dinosaurs being fake in general so i m uh i understand why would their bones be everywhere because the government time traveled and planted them there but which government because every every different country is the illuminati chris the ultimate government let me say a few yes let me say a few things why are there paintings of dinosaurs on cave walls because they saw the bones they saw bones of dinosaurs you think and they were able to draw what the actual body looked like so there s the conspiracy it goes a couple different ways right oh chris is google either dinosaurs never existed because every dinosaur name was invented by two guys in like a new york apartment in like i believe it was the s so it s a very weird timeline of how they were found out about and all this stuff okay the other theory is dinosaurs didn t go extinct million years ago and it was actually much more recent and that s why it s interesting that in like accommodate mexico they have little figurines of dinosaurs from around years ago because how would people only years ago know about things that were supposedly extinct million years ago well okay i have another question yeah how come in jurassic world dominion the whole idea that s real is there like a new one yeah yeah the final one how come it s minutes too long well conspiracy but also the whole thing is like oh my god what would happen if we live with dinosaurs oh no and then they do live with dinosaur spoiler alert uh they live with dinosaurs and they re like yeah well anyways look at those bugs like they like didn t care so i m like would the dinosaurs kill everyone like so then i started thinking maybe dinosaurs would live with people and be peaceful which makes sense for your theory how embarrassing but then where did the dinosaurs go that s the whole thing you know they traveled okay well that s my question so you re saying that the conspiracy is that they don t keep us from time traveling but why wouldn t why wouldn t we time travel if dinosaurs existed oh i get it here i am i ve arrived yeah yeah but that s very specific it s like to keep us from time traveling i don t know who that wants to go back million years my takeaway from jurassic world dominion is how have uh how have creatures not re evolved into dinosaurs what no i get i don t know what you re saying that was either the smartest thing i ve ever heard but i think that s actually a good thing because if evolution is constant what s driving it and dinosaurs had to have been like the pinnacle apex why do you have evolution crazies what do you mean like why why don t they exist again like what s what s keeping from like a bird to become a pterodactyl or what s like by the way chickens and birds are related to dinosaurs that s what i mean so why haven t they evolved further yeah well well supposedly when they were alive if if they were ever alive is they had feathers and things of that nature and they looked more like chickens than they would like what we re presented as that s even scarier i would never want to time travel and see a A A foot chicken did you see the hairy one that went underwater in jurassic world dominion that s probably more accurate because it was harry and looked like a chicken you looked like a messed up rooster do you remember that from what i understand dinosaurs like we re actually not smart at all they were like really unintelligent really no in jurassic world the raptors are like oh i don t think they could do A A calculus dude but i mean they they were pretty smart the t rex is like is like hey you do this and do this and then do this and i ll help you like that that literally was the movie i mean that s a they were icons A A icons what are you talking about wow that just ruined my whole life i thought dinosaurs were geniuses were there gay dinosaurs and if they were tops and bottoms would the bottom dinosaurs be called super sore asses there are so many but we already just spelled that myth there s no soreness no there s soreness poop is bigger than penises oh i don t know okay well obviously a dinosaur dick is a lot perfect that s bloody can you imagine but there are so many gay animals and species why wouldn t dinosaurs no you re right because there are so many gay animals which ones um these are all animals that naturally in the wild practice homosexuality african buffalo african elephant amazon river dolphin bison antelope asian elephant uh australian sea lion there s like here is that like t rexes or never mind they re like so dinosaurs could have been gangs there it is that s the theory what well that s why i see their icons that s Music chris pratt what are you doing not not my jungle that s how they were in the movie and then the chicken with his big chicken head and he was like oh oh there s though i m like trying to visualize what you just said because i haven t seen the movie something get a giant chicken jump into the water it s like this sounds A A awesome finally they figured it out would a homophobic animal owner disown their gay dog okay does the dog stay in the closet is the dog stay in the dog house i think they just humbled their dog would you even know dog had gay animals before and i knew what do you mean we have just no charlie big old queen recipe well because it just it his bark changed he did the voice because it s like i don t got ta like because he was going like and then they re like A A the wrath the dogs do you love them anyways yeah oh i would do so Music okay are you guys ready to uh investigate some glitches in the simulation yeah i cracked them all last time let s start simple and then we ll get to the crazier ones okay watch this girl on a swing closely oh did you see that what did she hit okay ready oh my gosh what what what did she just hit mid air whoa that looks crazy it looks like there s like a like a invisible rope on her hip that yanked that last a minute or something you know what i mean that is crazy like what happened whoever owns the pond and sold an invisible fence i mean you re saying it s like some fence but if you look at the impact spot it s about her hip when she s going down right yeah so that means that she wouldn t be able to break that barrier but her right arm swings through where that fence would be do you see what i m saying yeah like her right arm goes down lower than the yeah of where her hip hits the fence it actually just doesn t make sense i feel like they tried to create a viral moment her right hand if you stare at it it looks like it glitches up but then again if it s a glitch in the matrix it looks like you know wow that s weird okay watch the middle of the screen okay and see if you see the glitch yeah he just appears out of nowhere where did the bike i i just again feel like this is a thing it could be just a perspective thing oh yeah really how it could be but it might probably not such a good time because he could have been on the bike behind me yeah watch the man in front move around you ll see nothing behind him that d be a really crazy camera angle to be able to finish right ready he s looking around walking around whoa that s crazy i mean it is crazy how would there s no way look at the full sized bike though could fit yeah look at that look at the man if the bike wasn t sideways if it was straight on do you know what i m saying so you think that old man on the bike was crouching and it was straight behind i think he could the bike was straight on he was sitting on it and then like he was just getting ready or checking his watch or whatever and then started going it s either such a coincidence that they set this up and it was like perfect timing i don t buy it i think the guy on the bike is going to the matrix i think it s a glitch in the matrix obviously you guys are A A ops trying to get us off of the center okay this is uh i don t know if this is a glitch or if it s just something really scary and my nightmare but this is a video of somebody who said uh why did my doll s head just move oh okay so watch the transformer closely it s A A moving right i don t see it moving you didn t see it move did you see it move i feel like his camera angle is really weird too i mean hold on watch it again really like look close at the A A doll s head this camera movement s driving me crazy i mean if it is moving it s moving so slow okay it s moving it s moving okay i got a devil advocate on this one just a bit it s literally it just literally moved okay but when i googled it that toy is not robotic it doesn t move yeah but this feels like a very controlled environment and they re filming it to do this it looks like a pretty nerdy situation going on like this like like two where i mean like i m sure this person is very like all about technology and stuff and i mean the computer and all the cards all over the walls so maybe they they made it do that i don t know but i mean nonetheless i m sick how i m from i googled it i looked up video reviews of the toy the toy is not a movable toy it s not a robotic toys there s not a button it feels like he s in his own sound stage to me like he has a controlled environment he s filming it because he knows what he did i believe the other two this one i just don t A A with all right fine um okay this is another well you guys are probably not gon na believe this one either and i m sure there s science behind this but it definitely uh freaked me out this is a bubble hover what does that mean how how are you doing this i mean that s pretty nuts how is that happening i mean why won t you float away and how are they staying up high because the bubble doesn t have like helium in it i don t know i mean it s under a shelf so it s not like it s like what is going on i ve got to test this for myself watch bubble hover what you said or is that like a scientific term bubble hovers or i just made that up but look it they re not moving is it possible for bubbles to hover for a long time he said minutes minutes that s pretty crazy is it impossible for pepperdine you know it s reversible for burble to her because i don t even know how they could have finessed that but how how are you doing this this one you re gon na think is really like dumb but i watched it probably ten times and it just kept getting scarier to me this is a glitch of a woman laughing and then well just watch Music well that s a horror movie Laughter okay that was weird right that s a horror movie wait that s from a movie no it looks like a whole oh because she like froze when she was laughing and then she came out of it and she was like what just happened and i kind of believed her when she was like what just happened okay listen i was shook when i was watching it but now that i m thinking about it they edited the music to make us more scared so what s stopping them from pausing her as well okay then let s mute it let s watch it without music i mean she was look at her she s laughing having a good time drinking with the girls and then oh her brain just glitched oh my god oh my god oh my god ew this is so scary to me for some reason ew the zoom in look at her eyes are dead and now oh my god welcome back sweetie i mean people glitch for sure like i glitch frequently but not like okay here s the thing we re looking at her she s a sweet innocent girl would never do anything but there s things that you might take that ll get you looking like that for a couple seconds or she could have narcolepsy oh or she could have just had a minor stroke which is not funny at all my god wait way to dampen the mood i know but luckily science has proven none of that is accurate it s a glitch in the making that s what i was saying yes if she had a stroke or something i don t think she d come out of it and be like laughing with her girls and i don t think her friend would zoom in this is either friends doing this on purpose or the most terrifying thing i ve ever seen in my life should we try it wait okay wait let s try should we do it one by one or should we all do it at the same time all at the same time you can have fun in editing okay what are we doing we re gon na be her so we re all gon na laugh and then maybe i ll should i snap or something and then we all like freeze okay but you have to keep laughing when you re frozen i think that s part of it right wasn t she still laughing yeah i think she just she s like okay all right ready okay and Laughter Music did you ever snap Laughter that s when you stop everyone can see that okay Laughter Laughter i kind of think we killed it what just happened okay i hate that but that terrified me okay i have a final glitch we re gon na get into that it s gon na we re really gon na have to dissect this but before we do that just one little thing i have to show you because i never thought about it uh elon musk s smile is technically a glitch have you ever noticed that his smile is a frown whoa whoa cause he seems happy but it s a frown no he s he s smiling you can tell he s smiling but it s literally a frown when you actually like draw with your finger no that s is that real i think so wait try it is it like this do you i was just trying to do it i was giving myself a headache trying to do it like you know what though i mean who A A knows you know no you look sad no now you look like you re disapproving i m nervous if anything what it s showing me on on a macro level is it s really about your eyes you know because his eyes are what we re looking at thinking he s smiling but maybe he s not smiling how do we know he s smiling okay this is the last one this went viral i don t go on tick tock but i guess this went viral on tick tock and a lot of people were sending it to me and i watched it and i was like oh this is stupid and then i was like wait a minute i actually don t understand so this is the finale i don t understand anything i ve seen from tick tock Laughter okay so the craziest A A happened to me earlier so okay there was a glitch a glitch in the system i m gon na show you guys a video okay so in this video you can see me uh grabbing a lemon right i cut it in half and then i cut it in half once more right there you can see me cut it right i go get a bag okay i grab the bag i go back for the lemon and i grab the lemon and i touch it and i m like why is it not cut in half and my face i m like what the A A so i i m like inspecting it i take it out of the bag i grab this lemon trying to see if i cut that when i re cut the lemon because the lemon wasn t cut anymore i m freaking out because the lemon was not cut in half anymore it was literally intact and you can see me in the video cut the lemon in half there was a glitch there was this has never happened to me and i don t know how to act i m freaking out i m gon na play the video one more time so you guys can see for yourselves okay so she cuts it once okay and then cuts that one again pay close attention to the lemon let s make sure nobody else does some funky business is there something in her bag no whoa wow i m actually kind of shook because i thought she was doing like a magic trick but i was watching closely dad please explain to me what happened because i need to know that s pretty crazy so what happened i m so confused and i looked at the comments and nobody knows everybody s like ew i saw that lemon like mold back together or like oh my god like what what what was that i hate that one that s that s just crazy that s just what i mean what unless it was all just pre you know uh but i was trying to look for a lemon replacement or a trick unless this is like a vfx artist or something so it s either she had the foresight to do all of this ahead of time and make this video and have the idea or it happened and it s a glitch in the matrix i don t know that yeah that one s pretty nuts i have a hard time explaining that one i don t think i can either i would look to see if she made an update but i don t want to open tick tock Laughter so i m just going to say glitch confirmed wow all right so yeah there you go if any of you guys know how any of these glitches happen let us know in the comments because we can t figure it out i mean the lemon one does not make sense the girl on the swing like hitting an invisible fence the girl laughing let us know the bubbles let us know in the comments if you can figure these out help we need it okay it s about that time Music oh my god what happened oh my god is my recap cancelled sorry we ve had some changes at the network we re gon

Music so Music oh you brought it up because you re insensitive that is not how i started that conversation oh you said i had captured chris s dog oreo who i wanted to and i said i can t fathom having another animal i the only time i thought about like how i would because we were talking about the loss of an animal and how upsetting that is and it s like i could have a puppy and just start scream crying about the day that that puppy s no longer with me and i saw hades town a couple weeks ago and made the whole show about me and jelly because the lead was like a ginger man and i was like this is like i would follow jelly it s like way for me it was whatever sad if you know the play you you might know what i m talking about or or is this like a niche play or is it i thought no it s like a tony award it s a tony award winning play anyways do you think we have theater it made me think i could possibly have a puppy again well and that s my problem is even last night we had a minute ordeal because shane looked at uno cuddling with him and said looked at me and said we only have five more years with him jesus and then was saying he doesn t know how he ll go on without uno and then i just

mean i do i just couldn t even hear you talking about your dogs considering what i m going through with my dogs i know that s why i said it was insensitive but it was something that happened oh i think about it all that i think about it from the second i look a puppy in the face it s like can i handle the loss of you and the answer is no no i can t no and that s why i need a A A baby i need a human baby because something has to watch me die oh man i mean that is that sick and sad i love it too like i love the baby but like honestly i need something to watch me die for once all right well hello you guys and welcome to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay hello hello i hope you re having a fantastic week my week is starting off much better than last week right well you know i couldn t move last week because my next situation that you manifested into my life i didn t manifest it and i mean i mean i feel like it s contagious but i see your skin rashes moving about your body they re not moving i see more things happening on your neck this is a A A spider bite with a pimple on top of it thank you for the other thing it was a spider bite swear to god i ve never had a spider bite and it was shocking it was shocking because it was A A both i m not even kidding because pimples are round they don t get weird A A like so make a parallelogram spider bite no because i also like popped it well you re fortunate that it wasn t on your face because i m still recovering from the scar from the spider bite that was on i mean we ll be able to see this for time to come and then but and this is my skin fungus she s been right there she s contained she s going nowhere i m doing my cream in the morning and at night and i ll be doing that for another A A great seven days i don t think oh gosh we just have another gross podcast so eating your lunch half of our we re starting with skin fungus again the death of animals and then you have more poop on the A A i just was wondering well and it s an act well okay honestly it s a good question right okay well if you re eating what do you want to do have everyone leave in the first three minutes of our podcast i just don t think it s gross maybe we should circle back you don t think it s gross A A is gross right but i don t think my pregunta is gross what might have you read the question have you ever pooped and not looked at it that s my question have you ever pooped in not looked at it absolutely not like i look every time exactly could you find them not looking absolutely not right okay that s all i was wondering because the other day i like pooped and flushed and i was like i didn t look at it you have to know if it was a success or not because do i have internal bleeding like was it black like what s it steel and i didn t look and i was like i ll never know what s going on inside myself now that s what i have to do like my whole morning works up to that release and so i have to know if the release was indeed a release cause sometimes you ll have the like fake outs like in mid afternoon you ll think that something s happening and you think it did happen and you look down and there s nothing and you think you ve been swindled right i mean i like to look because it like tells me how i m doing okay you know also i got calls from everybody in my family shocked and appalled at the fact that you re a A A standard we are not going to start this fight again we re not starting to try we re not starting the fight you re wrong no i m not literally doesn t even have to be you re no you re so embarrassingly wrong disgusting out of his busy lawyer life to call me because he s worried because he wants you to know that standing to wipe is illegal in you re so states it s true i would like to tell you and i would like to tell all of you last time i was like teeter tottying like maybe i like half stand no i A A standing no i A A stand like i m full blown on two feet like doubling down on that imagine no i because i tried i was i thought okay let me see how i could even maneuver this but if you reach around you have to have such long arms then you might touch the toilet water it s i mean if you re like a A A weirdo none of these things are issues none of those things are rich well then i would like to sit with you with a mock poo i would like to see how you do this okay do you look at your poops before you flush chris oh yeah i do for the most part if i m in a hurry i think i just get out of there i was with an old friend that i used to live with the other day and she goes we used to send each other pictures of our poops and i was like don t be telling other people you guys did that you re sick and i said i don t remember that and she s like you definitely remember that and i was like maybe i blacked it out because it was so dark yeah matthew and i sent each other pictures of our poops but it s like i was like i didn t know any better i know oh it s not my business to share that so what no it s not my business that sucks that s gross that s like um what do they call that when you get somebody to ejaculate yeah yeah you re blue balling us but it s also like look at me and my self growth like not telling stories i m not allowed to tell you let s have like a moment for me thanks girls do you want to say something else embarrassing then let s make up for the lack of that story with a new one okay what do you have for us what happened to you this week what s going on i haven t talked to you because you wouldn t talk to me this week which is shocking because i m about to be leaving you gosh i wonder my week was just so boring okay i just was writing and writing and writing okay and that s why i couldn t hang out with you like i watched my bed sheets um i wish i would do that i went to orange theory um wow yeah meetings meetings we need to live a little bit more like last week when we had lived yeah we had lots of stories right but we re i tried to go hiking with you yesterday oh my gosh we re not gon na i don t want to fight with you right i went to costco on a A A sunday and this A A is tracking me of course costco on a sunday honestly i feel stupid admitting this had no idea how A A up costco on a monday at a m is awful costco s always this was different no costco on a sunday at around p m hits like a A A war zone and that s why they need to offer smaller carts for those who want to be able to navigate better i mean and sometimes it s just like the audacity of the people in that space like do you not feel that this is a packed ass warehouse and maybe you shouldn t stop in the exit two cards wide two cards wide to have like a conversation about like A A what don t you guys live together i will not get in the A A car you couldn t pay me to go to costco alone i need somebody there to like beat people off with me why do you choose those words get out of my way team of beater offers Laughter yeah that is embarrassing good save with that story since we ve done nothing this week i thought i could tell you about how i m a back sleeper now do you ever back do you ever change the way that you sleep um i mean all night i d be tossing and turning all night so you re not like stomach back or side i m uh stomach back and side all night i can t do the stomach thing because then your face is smooshed to the way i do it is i have my king size pillow that i put from my neck down and then i can be in a tummy sleeper see i feel like tummy sleeping is asking for the neck problems that i want to go that s why you need the the support on the neck that doesn t go all the way to the nog you need to have like a like a different like see this makes sense right well twofold i always sleep on my left side because it s best for digestion it s best to get the gas out it s but it s just the most comforting for me personally but then with me getting earrings and also my neck issue i asked the chiropractor when i went i said well what s the best way to sleep for your neck and he said a pillow where like your neck is curved and your head s all the way down back so i ve been trying to sleep on my back but do you have that pillow no but i do it s pretty awesome a pillow that i can manipulate enough it s like a feathery pillow nice i have like a tempur pedic firm pillow that i could that has a little dent in it so when i am on my back for that period of the night it s pretty sweet this is like a geriatric podcast we ve now left the squat turned and i did i went to i know we ve been talking about the chiropractor but i had never actually got in cracked before yeah and it s quite the experience it is you kind of feel like they re in love with you and then they hurt you and then they hurt you and they shock you with it too because they re like oh talking talking talking stop and you re just like oh my god will i ever trust anyone ever again but it did bring sweet sweet relief it does but like honestly i scream bloody murder every time and i m like sorry it s just because i m scared my husband hates that i do this well and i i didn t realize how many people thought chiropractics were or it s uh it s not it s holistic alignment no i m just saying it s uh controversial i guess is the word i m looking for oh because some people don t believe in it like they say that it doesn t work but my whole theory with and i know nothing about it i know nothing scientifically about it but why in my opinion why wouldn t it work you re made up of different joints and stuff when you break your wrist or a bone the doctors pop it back into place so how would this is a little bit different the joint is specifically a little bit different because they re not like doing x rays on our bodies and like we see a different person every time we go in there and they re not like also doing like massage therapy and like all of those things but i ve never understood why people don t believe in a legit chiropractor because i feel like yoga is you re trying to do the same thing which is like workout tension in your body so i feel like it s a no brainer that it would work and after it brought me relief i just believe yeah so did you pick up that monthly membership no you re so crazy no that s the con of chiropractics because i felt this is like this i felt fun so hard no because how are you it s you have to sign up for three months and then to get out of it you have to rock up in there and beg to get out of it and i know i m done here i m never gon na do that i don t think you can even call so you have to then go have that awkward conversation of canceling something it s like canceling a gym membership yeah oh awful they want to call and talk about it and you re like i no longer want to be healthy shut up i hate that wow so i just bought and because i felt bad i didn t want to do the one time visit so i said i ll just buy your four pack visit which c was so much more buying is yeah so much more money well that s what i felt was the scam of it all i felt like the actual optics worked but the way that they sold it as if it my life depended on it when i had never needed it before now was a little iffy to me i think i needed it before i went though okay which is why i got it and i like i go once a week see and adding another thing to the schedule is just to i mean i like it though yeah because i feel i feel bad like i always feel bad and it s exhausting because you re working from your bed by choice that s true no jelly s been enjoying sitting in my office chair so i ve been back at my desk but even at my desk i m like hunched over like neck forward well something that grinds my gears just a little bit yeah what gets your goat well as i was driving around this week A A sirens in music yeah they re confusing oh not only confusing enraging also like why it s not a good noise it should be illegal and and it s overplayed the amount of times that sirens are in music and they re so realistic are insane like i just and then i got fooled three times in the same song because it sounds so realistic and i think it was like oh i got ta pull over i m getting stopped and then i kept going and it got me again and again and i thought god A A this A A you know what this A A you know what i m thinking only you no way i m not there three times with the same song it was so those songs were A A four minutes long well they get you though because so you re pulling over every minute getting got like you have you have seconds to recover and then they A A fool you again it hits in so hard that you just think wow and even if i don t believe it it s still enraging the man who stands to wipe his ass everyone Laughter i know there s people that are on my side yeah sick A A let s create a divide here we don t need to the divide has been made it s an evolutionary divide all right i was thinking about this as i was pooping earlier what i i i m going to be honest i m pooped in your house right yes i m so sorry you A A in this man s house i did and i i m sorry as i was doing it i couldn t help it it was a long drive from bakersfield but as i was doing it i was like hmm and i was like thinking about how all of us pooped and the discussion and i was like how did that and i like deeply thought about like getting up and letting the poop spread all over your butt what do you mean you must be dumb well no when you re sitting down in my mind in my mind when you re sitting down your cheeks are as open as they can be yeah and then when when i stand my cheeks are closed that s what our thoughts go to yeah okay it s not like there s more than two seconds he mutes himself chris has had enough mute there s not more than two seconds that my butt cheeks are closed in the time that i m standing out maybe thinking too much all it takes is two seconds you know anyways does it hurt your feelings when what when you send somebody you don t do this maybe chris go back off mute okay so like you know how when you re scrolling through like tik tok or instagram reels and you see something and you re like oh my god this reminds me so much of so and so like i got ta send it to stone so right now like this is our A A jam and you send it to them and they go i ve already seen this does it hurt your feelings because they didn t send it to you it s just kind of a bummer yeah yeah it s like that s our A A thing A A and you didn t send it that s your thing yeah well like you know that s what your relationship is based upon but sometimes like i have a friend that i do teen mom with and i ll be scrolling and i ll see some A A about a teen mom on tick tock and i send it to her she goes i ve seen that and like wow our relationship is like so bottoming out for you that you don t even send me a A A tick tock that you know is our A A thing and it s been our A A thing for years honestly when i get six tick tock links from you in a row there it feels like a chore i mean you and i don t necessarily have things like that you know what i mean what do you mean like we we engage in everything together so there s not like one specific thing no that s not true like when i send you tic tocs it s because i think of you specifically and when i do go and watch them most of the time i am pleased that i did they re curated for your pleasure thank you i have a for you page from lizzie but the point being like there are some people where like one of the core pillars of your relationship is a thing and you can see it online and you send it and they re like yeah i saw that or it s like something new is happening for example farrah abram s mom is a A A rapper now which i didn t A A know until i stumbled upon it and i send this girl the tick tock and she goes oh yeah i knew that you didn t think to pick up the phone and call me like you didn t want to send me a link to this i ve seen that what A A i couldn t see this for two seconds and not send it to you obviously this relationship is A A over there s no real love there anybody else hurt that way am i taking this way too personally you re taking it too personally i don t think i am although you know what has gotten me what the wiggle wiggle yeah i feel like i i feel compelled to do that once you want to learn it today almost let s get it don t whip it do it you want to do it with our dole whip A A yeah with we could each have two in our hand to do the wiggle wiggle and hopefully the dole whip will sway with us oh my god let s do it it takes me a long time to learn a tick tock tip too so be perfect i m you know i m not the most so we have to rehearse without the dull whip so the dole whip doesn t melt while rehearsing yeah oh am i standing on my own headset i couldn t couldn t adjust my head and there are certain times where i have been thankful for tick tock specifically like when you sent me the tick tock of kendall jenner cutting the cucumber yeah that was absurd there s no other platform that that kind of content of somebody reacting to her cutting a cucumber would exist and it did bring upon a lot of joy what kill just yeah well as i said what kills me the most is her being like don t film me i m like bad at this i just love the whole time chris is like the chef can do the chef can you get this kind of kendall watch your fingers the chef yeah i m just like jesus god i want to just live in kris jenner s gus i want a chef for my husband every time that A A cooks it s like oh should we drag our husbands again you know i don t want to because i m scared he s going to catch why and i feel like it s toxic they re like everyone like listen to what this A A did and it s like we are so close to our one year anniversary that like maybe i should stop complaining about him so publicly okay we ll all do i ll complain about shane in a loving way yeah yeah you know what here s what i love he looks like what we love about them so much right like so like i personally love that my husband goes to sleep at four o clock every morning and wakes me up when he comes to bed and then when i wake up at a decent hour like in the morning he thinks it s absurd and that i m being in control are you banging pots and pans at in the morning who A A cares if i am it s a monday Laughter you know what i mean what the A A and that s what i love about joe i love a lot of things about him that s one of them we are the same in our relationships that we re both like going to bed at a reasonable normal hour which i ve been trying to convince shane our whole relationship the time i go to bed is the time america goes to bed and he goes you re wrong i know that you re wrong like what happened up watch and i go no i m not wrong like the world wakes up and goes to work and they go to bed between and or pm chris what time are you going to bed don t ask A A chris chris is a part of the problem and he s going to totally ruin everything for us truthfully i m part of the problem and i go to sleep very late but i agree with everything that you just said that the majority of people like there s a reason why when i m up late at night everything s closed you know what i mean yeah like most people aren t at least you can like a normal person admit that yes there are night owls yeah and i m shane s productive at night so i m not there s nothing wrong right it s just he can t even admit that that is the norm that is what happens yeah and i was saying like i had always romantic romanticized before getting in a relationship the image of oh my god i m gon na get in a relationship and we re gon na be standing next to each other brushing our teeth and then we re gon na jump in bed have a little cuddle kiss watch like a minute youtube video debrief on it and say goodnight and spin to our sides and just go to bed instead i get someone kicking me off their side of the bed because i ve moved on because they re never there and when shane comes to bed it s too dark for him because he can t see anything so he turns on his A A phone flashlight to the brightest capacity that it goes navigating his way through the room that s pitch black and i m like shang what are you doing and i m like can you at least point it like opposite like if you need the light can you at least just point it downwards or can you adjust in the bathroom for a second before walking into the room and he s like i m pointing it away from you obviously you re not obviously you re not because it s violently waking me up and then i yeah i confessed to him the other day i was like don t you ever just wish that we could go to bed together and he goes you don t want that and i said you re right yeah i rip most my ass during the hours of A A like nine to twelve and i like to sneak up and watch my own content for about an hour before i go to bed i m reading in there of course you re reading so sophisticated she s so much better than me no and then also sometimes i m just watching tick tock so joe will come in to like say good night and like get out don t look at me turn off the light joe started also doing this weird thing where it s like his muscle memory is to just turn on the brightest lights in our room when he comes in and then he goes oh A A and then turns it back off so it s like i m on the brink of a seizure and then he comes in any A A kicks me off his side of the bed and then like like screams at me like oh god damn it and it s like what are you yelling at me for right now that i shoot up in anxiety because of the way you enter the A A room and you oh god dad and it s like what are you you re scaring the life out of me well i m dead to the world asleep and vulnerable like you literally enter like the A A night stalker bro like i m scared and last night i literally had to say like hey um can you please not shout at me when my reflex is to shoot up gasping in terror at your entrance into the bedroom at night and then this A A has the audacity to text me this morning and say i need to be quieter in the mornings after screaming at me for horrifying me when it comes to bed it s like i love this so much about him we loved it we love them so much no honestly my life would be boring without what would we do if we weren t woken up at am i d probably not be so A A depressed you know what i mean like i probably wouldn t be so goddamn debilitated and exhausted the next day i will admit there s sometimes when shane goes to bed and then i get woken up and then i can t go back to sleep and he s ready to go to bed and then i m like so what have you been watching what s going on you know what i was thinking about when i was going to bed he s like shut up and i m like well well i can t even talk to joe because he s like he gets like livid like i don t even understand what it is but the dude is A A mad and it s like you are so lucky that you ve hit like a really hot point in your life and that you re so A A attractive i could never walk away from that ass so you watched this is us for the oh i don t yeah good she s sick um i don t watch this is us i know but i did watch the first part of the finale lizzie goes i watched this is us for the first and last time and i said it wasn t even the finale which thank god i have to oh my gosh well by the time this is out it s over um uh joe i just i A A started scream crying i was like Laughter and joe comes out and he goes what s wrong this show is so A A sad and he s like turn it off turn it off right now so i only watched the first half of it he s like why are you doing this i was like i want to cry at something that s not my own life today i want to cry at something that s unrelated to my own struggles just for one day sad sad girl things but you know that s why we re going to get dole whip later because i need her like i need to remember why i m still here you know why i m doing this i don t want to forget what could happen and i love it that it s that powerful without even having the context of the whole series of relationships yeah i mean no matter what i m always gon na have i m always gon na scream cry over like the death of a mother scene or like something like that because it s like it just hits so hard i don t know i don t do well with death i do well with everything else well and that s why it s one of my favorite shows because it s a great time to cry oh my god and i get it so i m not allowed to watch it at home anymore no because when i tell you the scream crying was like the me scream crying after hitting that bird joe was so scared he s like he ran down the hall he s like what s wrong like thinking something s wrong with the dogs which is like it totally could be something wrong with the dogs but i didn t feel good to feel something though i mean i feel something every day but it feels good to feel something that s not about reality i like i like i like i like have convulsions when i m watching the show it s very it s a great time honestly i m so sick when i had a drinking problem i used to watch charlie st cloud and drink a blender full of red wine because it was the biggest cup i could find and just cry and i used to tell people to do it all the time they d be like what is wrong with you it was a dark week last week what can we say are you ever gon na do you wan na unpack why you re sad i feel like you just keep telling people you re scream crying all day on the podcast it s no one s business okay no i did think it was very funny the way it played out last week with no details you d be like no i get it i d be sad if i were you too and that s what i mean like do you want to bring them along at all no i can t this is my safe space okay all right um should we get into some iced tea yeah do you want to i think you did we cover everything yeah we do wow look at all of our non existent lives i really think we need to like get out there and live this week so we have something to report back i do be trying to live though okay honestly us going to four workout classes a week don t whip A A and getting a salad is not interesting level up level it don t work okay all right oh like before we move on do we want to talk about the fact that we ve seen maybe this is part of ice tea okay let s get into it here we go come along with us we ve only been doing this for like two years segway we did it um this isn t on the docket do you mind no remember when we were trying to watch senior year together oh yeah oh we can talk about all the movies we do a movie yeah of of all the things i couldn t get through he does like four minutes of every movie then he s like dead but he could sit through all of spencer yes he s got a dignified well the thing is like i was excited for senior year i liked the trailer i sent you the trailer when it come out came out senior year was the first script i read when i was an intern at broken road which is the production company that made the film so i i don t even think i got to her in present day because i was so annoyed by it honestly i think i blacked out through most of it but it was pretty unbearable and then i pivoted and saw the lost city had come to free and i watched the lost city after i watched senior year but you only made it to daniel radcliffe and thought this is too kitschy and not it s not my kind of humor i didn t laugh he literally got to the first sighting of daniel radcliffe which is like maybe eight minutes in and it s like the point where they re just doing that expositional she from a book reading that went south because she started abusing A A channing tatum in a really sad way by the way the movie was dumb as A A but so fun listen i love sandra bullock that was that that movie had some shockingly funny moments spoiler alerts for the lost city coming at you right now brad pitt gets shot in the A A face and his blood splatters chanting tatum pretty A A funny pretty A A funny and then another really funny moment is sandra bullock and channing tatum are like running from these bad guys in the jungle and they like make this booby trap where they try to trip the guy on the motorcycle and he A A flies up a cliff to his death and they both have a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that they killed someone like it s funny this show is funny okay i might go back and give it a try it s not those are two moments in like minutes and then we have a minute before this runs out but then do you want to talk about the other movie you watched i uh suffered through good morning a mod sun and machine gun kelly collaboration and i don t want to talk too much A A because honestly that s the kind of low bar i m trying to hit for our christmas that s what i m talking about they made it happen if they can well no kelly s like really popular yeah unfortunately we re not as good as those two people and when i say good i don t mean talented because i would argue we re more talented than them when it comes to storytelling but uh that movie uh was so bad that i was watching it with joe and james and their friend jake and i was like wow imagine hanging out with these guys in real life well what a A A nightmare that must be and we re out time what does that mean yes oops what are we doing now iced tea yeah i oh you didn t put all the things in here yes i might have rearranged them what there s more down here we ll see last week you acted like you were just rearranged then you left hella out no i have them all here i thought there was a better uh a better way to organize okay they don t need to know this i mean it s so boring oh cut this out taylor swift receives honorary doctorate from nyu you act like you re reading this without having known what happened taylor swift received an honorary doctorate from nyu what does that mean it means that she s like a we have to call her dr swift now did she get a degree that s what an honorary doctorate means yes so she went to school she went down that s what honorary means it s honorary they re honoring her with it even though she did not do it so she has a college degree she has a doctorate so she s a doctor swift i don t believe it i mean how does this make sense so something they ve been doing the normal the average american this is how they do it every time okay but so the normal person has to go to college for eight years and pay their whole life back and students listen to you high school graduating class of drop out of college get A A famous give a speech one time in your life and become a doctor it s not like an actual doctorate s degree no like she can do surgery now she s a A A doctor Laughter come on bring me along for the real facts those are the facts she can t do surgery it s an honorary doctorate it s like a lip service like hey thank you so much for talking like you re a doctor too like whatever why can t it just be like an honorary speaker she does not get a degree from this she gets an honorary doctorate okay i think that s awful choice of wording but okay i think it s their choice awarding their choice we re grading to everyone that spent their whole life at college i don t disagree okay i don t disagree i m not my policy i m not being mad at her i m mad at this it feels like you re mad at me it feels like you re taking this out on me and i just want you to remember that like i m not a doctor nor am i an honorary doctor so like take your spot with taylor was the speech recorded was it sickening what did you get from i thought that the speech was sickening the quotes i read were really cringy yeah people were calling it cringe but i definitely think that there s a lot of value in what she said like choose what you carry through life because resentments are too heavy and it s a long A A walk i mean yes she s i mean i don t doubt that she has amazing wisdom she s been through enough for seven lives why did you say that to me like it was like a really why did you look at me like that you said that the lives oh i m really proud of saying lives right i was like that that s not like a profound quote and then i was you just said the words right unknown caller oh my god oh my god who is it i don t know should we answer yeah agora hills just take it i don t know that s scary i m so scared of unknown numbers i mean they probably are going to do something for you i don t know about that they re probably going to be like otherwise i would have said spam what were we even talking about honestly that just rattled me to the core nobody should be calling me whatever what what taylor swift and her profanities her profanities profound your profanities her profound wisdom because i mean she had to write a whole album about reputation after going through a whole bunch of stuff and so i do think that she has a great amount of wisdom and we should be listening to her on how to go throughout the world or at least what she has to say you don t have to apply it to your own life yeah i also just think it s cool like tish literally nyu this there s like a class that they teach on like taylor swift and her music like really yeah and also it s like but i m just part of me just to make it about myself i was when i graduated from college like taylor swift and i would have preferred her to speak at my A A graduation but now these youngsters who like barely even appreciate her in fact have A A on her repeatedly do you think so yeah they re hella judgy they re hella judgy they only recently came to love today with the taylor s version of A A A A i forgot the name of this fake fan oh i m blacking the one that disses the man jake yeah but anyways it s like they re fake fans they don t A A know they didn t grow up with her i was with her i ve been knocking on A A bedroom doors like our song was my song like back out up here with that entitlement class of nyu i m jealous how about her boyfriend that i know nothing about showing joe in this yeah but now all of a sudden he s a star of a hulu show called conversation with friends and i only watched the first minutes but it seems like there s gon na be a lot of steamy uh lovey sex scenes and so he s doing press for it and i just find it fascinating i didn t know that he was an actor i know he helped produce her i did an album it was a suit what did they call it whatever a what a pseudonym on her record like he used a fake name um because he produced the whole album with her um but i just thought it was fascinating i didn t know he was an actor i didn t either i just knew his name was joe kissing women in hot lovely sexy imagine how awful that would be i know you don t even want to kiss in the movie you re producing because you have a husband so i mean it is big of taylor to just be like that s my man joe s pretty cool about it but i don t like it i wouldn t want joe to like go to work and like kiss some A A and then come home late at night am kick me out of my side of the bed so he s not allowed to be an actor no joe s not allowed to be an actor that s toxic i don t care i think i finally had an epiphany that i m not meant to be an actor no i mean i m just not great at it i was watching clips of things i mean i guess i could get good at it the evolution of this dream was too much for me i mean i m just not good at it i wasn t great at hosting either in the beginning so i guess if you want something really bad you can make it oh that s crazy that you ve come to that conclusion why that you have to work at a craft to be good at it i told my agent if it s not me don t send it my way i m not trying to start a creepy oscar i want to land in it i don t want to be in an oscar project i want to be like the gay assistant in ugly betty and i still believe that takes a lot of work because it s a lot of comedic timing but i would like to start as a character as close to myself as possible but now i m thinking i don t even know if i want that life i just want to be me did we just cancel the christmas movie well no okay i can yeah i can counteract myself i change my thoughts every day on everything i love that for you and anna delvey had an art show in new york wasn t in attendance because she s in a detention center orange county in fact okay so you felt you felt uh fell victim to that as well it s called like the oc facility center but it s actually in upstate new york all this time i thought she was in orange county in the sunshine when she walks out of her jail cell crazy and no it s in like upstate new york that s crazy so she i guess was making art from prison and a company bought all of it and put on this art show yes and she like spoke from prison like did a voice recording but there was a tick tock of a girl who was there and she s like there s no art on the walls here she s like there s some tinfoil in a frame there s a there s a drag queen here that kind of looks like anna delvey who s screaming if you re poor get out but it s like it s not a conventional i m not even making that up no i watched the tick tock you sent it to me and then she finally had people bring out these sketches which are like really bad well she s in jail she had i don t give a A A if she s in jail i was in the jail of a A A sales girl job and my sketches and doodles were great and so she had girl like bottle service girls walking out but without instead of like popping alcohol they were just holding the art yeah i mean it seemed like a fun event this girl seemed like a hater after being invited then just saying the event was such a mess like it probably was a mess but it also looked very fun it actually didn t look poorly coordinated it looked very coordinated yeah and it did seem very fun and stupid and i think just like being there is like energizing and weird you know because it s like anna delvey s art show and she s in the orange county shooting real housewives in lockdown god what a great show that would be real housewives and lockdown i bet there s a lot of them wow dibs on that show that was my idea i don t think the prisons would allow for that i think they would there s yeah there s hella docu series in A A prisons okay like love after lockdown or something and there s there s shows in prisons okay with full blown documentary clues like orange is the new black i m kidding i know that was scripted gotcha this is so bad none of this has made sense since we ve broken down that might be true like sunset drama okay this is good what did you listen to christina oh my gosh she swapped i know well you didn t tell me i had to i said do you want me to he sends me a link to the call her daddy interview with christine quinn quinn and i said do you want me to listen to this and i said if you want to listen to it guess what listen to it i did not want to listen to you you didn t no after watching the season of selling sunset like you re forgetting i jumped in season five like i have no emotional connection to these psychopaths and they re they re psychopaths well okay i did lo i saw one thing on tick tock where christine s talking or whoever the A A the caller daddy girl is is like you see like what s his name pratt spencer s pratt talking about how they edit people to look like villains like do you feel like you were like edited to look like a villain because like spencer pratt is like on tick tock like doing all this and she s like well that was the case back when the hills was happening yeah christine seems like a legitimate bad person well that s why i told you to watch the this interview with call her daddy because she really does portray a story that makes you feel for her and now i fall i have fallen victim to the internet where it s like swinging left and right depending upon whatever anybody says but at the end of the day i just have to remember it s a reality show all of it s probably fake i mean she has a lot of stories in that from the beginning she was set out to be the villain and then so one of the big uh bombshells of this season is that she had bribed a client five grand to leave one of the other agents to come over to her and she says that s absolutely not true she had started her own brokerage with her husband so she had given notice at the beginning of filming this season that she was going to be leaving the brokerage but she wanted to get creative with how they still portray her and maybe go between both of the brokerages and she said that s selling sunset s way of kind of uh sending her out regardless if she comes back to the show or not but they needed like a surefire way to get rid of her on the show and christine has also come out and said that adam davillo who s the creator of the hills who has now created selling sunset uh has like gotten a screaming argument with her telling her to kill herself and fall down the effing stairs because when the episode started coming out that had been um re edited against her favor she was started speaking the truth in interviews about how things actually went down and then he didn t like that she was speaking her truth against the narrative that the show told her to kill herself and then on top of that i guess he s not even allowed because there s been enough uh claims made against him to the production company or to netflix because he is the production company that he s not even allowed to be in the same room as any of the women when they re filming i don t know if that s true or not but he still has creative control over the show and she said that she brought to the call her daddy podcast uh the press screening which they like the first cut of what they were gon na send out and then what actually made air showing like heather react or how christine reacted to something that wasn t even something she had said showing how they like mimic story lines because they have well they lie and that s why they have writers credited because it s not real that s not reality they re six people storyboarding everything that they have gotten and she said that she tells all of the women that that they re doing a job that they re playing heightened versions of themselves and if they ever actually feel slighted that they can call her after filming but she said it s not not true that the producers rile them up like she says every house has been permitted six months in advance because it s or six weeks in advance because it s a tv show and when they show up to record at a house or do a lunch they re all separated with producers running in saying well we just had a lunch with this person that said this about you and they hold them all until they re about to film and then they film for hours on hours and won t let them leave sometimes until they get the girls to say what they want to say i mean i just can t imagine signing up for something like that well it s crazy because there s a there s a strict formula that this man follows which is why it s so successful yeah like lauren was the crechelle of the hills right like the beloved untouchable and that s what i after listening to christine i m sure there s so many elements to all of it and it s crazy to get riled up about any of it not real right but imagine being this sick A A who s like let me find some underage girls and do the A A laguna beach thing and then take them in their early adulthood which is a huge developmental phase in their lives well spencer s claiming that he had grabbed heidi heidi had actually tried suing him because of it well i m just saying like that s some sick A A A A yeah i mean it is all crazy and what spencer had said is when they kept doubling down on spencer and heidi being the villains based upon something that wasn t even factual and he has brought out receipts onto the thing that was like their demise on the show not being actual actually factual he said all the other cast members just watched and participated in the downfall of them and christine says well it s not untrue of what they re doing to me but i can separate myself from the show and know that what i m doing and a lot of these other girls can not right so i mean it s just like you don t know what all these other i m seemingly good girls actually know or their actual play in it it s also messy but the seemingly good girls seem heightened to the degree of actual upset with christine so i do wonder if they re being fed certain information i mean i m positive they re being fed certain information just to make them that riled up when they see her because their blood is boiling yes and it s probably hard not to get emotionally involved in it especially once it starts airing and then other cast members start doing interviews and did you see what she said here i mean it s like family drama but unfolding public it s just it s too much it s insanity and i mean it s the perfect whirlwind for a reality show it s just so toxic on all accounts because i honestly don t think anyone comes out looking great i guess they get success and fame and money but i don t know but like at what cost yeah because it s also not a longevity game like you can t do this forever we ve seen that with the hills like they re the hottest A A while the show s on yeah and a lot of them have maintained but it s but you know justin bobby s still a bartender really yeah i don t even know what s going on with the hills re i mean you watch reboot okay fascinating and it was honestly like a little bit sad to watch christine did say she s the highest paid because she actually said that she went and tried to get everyone to get on board to hold out until they all got paid and she said some of the girls which is a super normal thing i know but she said some of the girls were just so eager to be on the show and sign their contracts that they folded and then she said i was the last one to sign and so she got the most amount of money and that s the thing is now that she s left the brokerage started her own didn t show up to the reunion with a lot of other drama surrounding that it s like they re gon na have to fight to get her back because without her there s no drama yeah and even if the drama within the girls well they would have to make the drama between christelle and jason which and g flip if yes which yeah which isn t selling sunset i mean the show s more popular than ever so it will be interesting to see how they navigate this going forward i think if they don t have christine they don t really have a show my problem with the edit of the show is christine was shown just like push like my problem with christine s character in the show is it was always like her putting her in her mouth yeah because but then like she d get full blown caught and couldn t justify getting caught but i think it s because of the there are so many work arounds and she was pregnant and she had an awful birth and an emergency c section and time who knows it s all crazy crazy crazy crazy okay moving on to pete davidson leaving snl i had been asking you for weeks and weeks and weeks this man must not even be on the show i mean like no he was and he s this was his last episode and like i care a lot less about pete leaving the show i we barely watch it no i i ll probably see about to minutes of episodes every weeks yeah i mean when there s a i cried a little like i laughed a little bit at kate mckinnon s exit so kate mckinnon opened the show with a really funny sketch actually it was an abduction sketch three women were abducted on a road trip two of them had a really good time one did not and they just had this really fun game they were playing where they kept talking about like using different words for her butthole and her vagina hole and it was just so funny and she d be like you know my front hole in my wrong hole just so funny and she just had a horrible time but then on her way out she gets you know summoned up by the aliens again and she s just like thanks for letting me stay well well i m from new york and it s like that s the last time she s gon na say that i love kate mckinnon i think she is a treasure i really like her too has she been on this season much um not really so a lot of these people that are leaving they ve kind of been tip toeing but again me saying not really is based off of like five minutes of like yeah ten hours of content i never watch snl but i feel like pete he go he shows up when it s convenient to him and i don t realize how i don t understand how that works with contracts like when you re contracted to a show you can just not show up and that s fine or maybe that s why his contract isn t getting renewed and he s i think he did not want to renew his contract well he was on an interview i think with charlemagne about him being made fun of and he said i personally think that i should be done with that show because they make fun of me on it i m like the cold open political punch lines i m weekend update jokes and when i m not there they re like pete s a jerk face and he always he thought he said whose side are you on i have a weird feeling this is a quote from him i have a weird feeling in that building that i don t know whose team they re playing for if he s the joke if he is the joke or if he s in on the joke and i mean that would be a hard place to be but i guess yeah i don t know i mean if you barely show up i mean that kind of anxiety might breed itself he probably just wants to move into the million dollar mansion kimbot next to her plot of land oh that s that why she bought that maybe i mean he probably he probably just wants to explore i bet he s going to move to california yeah he was also in that atrocious movie good morning really yeah well so things are looking up for him yeah i bet he ll be in kim s mansion i think he has a hulu show too i mean he s working a lot and i feel like he always has a movie coming out yeah i think there s always a movie that he s promoting that s coming out so he did say one thing that was kind of funny on his last weekend update where he was like lauren michaels finally accidentally gifted me a sock so i m free which is a harry potter reference for rand i don t get it i don t get it i m too busy standing to wipe my poop to understand harry potter references silly me uh what else um i mean there s all of the kravis oh that s right i literally forgot about the kravis wedding which everybody is A A talking about i know i can t escape it and i feel like the wedding has been since their vegas wedding i feel every day i swipe to the left on my phone where the news is and it s an article about their wedding i m like when is this wedding gon na end because the wedding s been happening for five A A months it s been a long wedding i m happy that they re happy and i m so happy that they re happy i wish that i could stop seeing the headlines and just watch it unfold on the kardashians when it happens in the year from now right but what do you have for us um did you look at any of the looks no so this was like basically like that gala yeah the girls some of them looked better than they did at the met gala experts would say um what is shocking if we think of the karjenner clan as like a horse race usually one is leading in the fashion industry and like one of them always sort of pulls looks and vibes and is like the clear winner of the event but because this is such a long event like we have to tally up points from across a few days and uh an unexpected victory for khloe kardashian who was the best dressed car jenner of the weekend go ahead and hit that yellow button really yes for our revenge body queen for her yeah she wound up having the most cohesive best dressed vibe for the whole weekend and she wore this leopard number on one of the nights that just had such a stunning silhouette i do feel like coco might have taken her workout dietary restrictions to an extreme and she might want to chill the A A out because she s stunning and snatched and it s like i found the brakes a little bit girly but who are we to judge who i m not judging but like have some pasta and a cookie it s fine um or cannoli because they were serving both at the wedding um and here is what i never thought i would say kim did not show up for me in in the looks department in the outfit department she wore a gray look on the first night that was like a lesser version of an outfit that she wore when she was like people don t want to work anymore like that interview she wore like a lesser version of that maybe she was being respectful and didn t want to show up the bride i don t think that i will say a thing she thinks about one of the most shocking storylines of this season of the kardashians on hulu is the fact that kim is really grappling with the fact that she doesn t know how to dress herself yeah being the fashion icon that she has been inside of this world for the past decade i thought it was fascinating to learn that kanye in collaboration with his stylist has an outfit delivered and laid out ready to go for kim every day and kim said i m a robot in that sense i like to go to my closet and have it picked out to me but then in my mind it feels a little scammy in the sense that skims is so popular it s then i did start thinking well who s the creator if you can t dress yourself are you the creative behind skims or was that kanye as well because i know kanye was the initial like business i don t know if it was a partnership yeah but he owns a piece and i know it s very different skims originated from shapewear which is very organic to kim but the fact that she doesn t dress herself and the fact that kanye does want to dress her blows my mind i mean i we missed she missed kanye this weekend you know what i m saying like she and some people are like claiming that like kim showed up at the wedding night in that bejeweled bustier but like i say nae nae like i don t think that was the vibe i didn t see it her look like she had some looks that did pass my vibe check but like one of the dresses she wore i m like i have that and it s from abercrombie in fact it s cute i bought it at full price it wasn t even on sale but like i got it from abercrombie and french you know what i m saying um but yeah let s hear it for coco kylie you know slayed the game too i would say kylie and kendall are tied for second place okay and then courtney kind of just wore the same outfit all weekend in a different color and i was surprised i did see it looked like travis wore a traditional just black suit travis looks good when he s really been playing up fashion everywhere else i ve been seeing him in a way that i don t agree with i mean no he s been working that voldemort honey it does it s specific to him and it s definitely unique and remember remember memorable memorable memorable it wasn t serving what else do we have here um Music there was one other funny thing which was kylie posted a video on instagram which also this whole thing was just like live on instagram all weekend like all the kids were posting everybody there was posting like i haven t seen these women posted their grids like this in quite some A A time the only person who was like quiet about it was kim but like well those looks who cares you know what i m saying um i m just kidding i m just being nasty um but kylie posted this hella funny video of kendall trying to walk up the stairs in one of her dresses and she just couldn t do it she s like wearing like birkenstock A A sliders and she like her feet are going out behind her in a crazy way because her dress was so tight and long that she couldn t move her legs up to get up the stairs it was funny i like to watch kendall struggle a little bit you know what i mean it s like putting socks on a cat and just like watching them flail because she s so beautiful and elegant it s funny it s funny i hear you oh my god what i you know i love the kardashians yes car jenners whatever but i also love the phoenix suns oh is that and devin booker is on the phoenix suns and my husband has informed me that every basketball player that kylie A A dates ends up choking so A A hard that their careers are over you mean kendall what did i say kylie yeah i mean kendall so we like literally the suns were the best A A team in the league and going into playoffs they were like expected to make it to like whatever the nba finals are and in the last game devin booker was something like for in shots when he s like one of the best A A players in the league and the the team lost in like a horrible A A loss like down points from being the best team in the league like it s literally one of the worst games in playoff history and now we re blaming it on the woman in his life well we were all keeping it quiet for a long time because booker was doing so well they were like maybe it s not real maybe it s not real but now it s like no the proof is in the pudding like there s like five dudes like one guy was like the top pick A A draft player like makes every shot and then he started dating kendall and all of a sudden he can t make a shot and he was transferred to another team and he s so A A up in his head game wise that he won t even play he refuses to actually play and he s just sitting out his contract is it because their their relationship is so full encompassing and they re so in love i would not say that s the case because they re also no longer together they aren t no i m talking about other guys there s like a A A laundry list of men whose career she s ended and i don t believe in these things but like when joe like started reading down the list i was like that is an uncanny amount of people who no longer have a job after dating her like and i love her i m not saying that s that s a problem like i m not calling her like a succubus or anything like that but like it is a lot of A A a lot of things adding up you know what i m saying all right well i hope everyone enjoys i m starving um if you want to follow us on social media we re at the sip official we re also all there personally uh yeah thank you so much for watching and supporting we love you very much we ll see you next week goodbye and that s the sit i just realized we didn t even talk about A A ufos well next week we got to do our conspiracy theories because i do feel like we need to A

God because I was like our refrigerator beeps like that our micro beeps like that our A A oven beeps like that our dishwasher beef so I was like what is beeping okay so now you can have some empathy for your mom who has to live with that no at first I was like construction this A A A A dropped down some hereditary earringing A A and I will never forgive her for it um but thank God they re just cutting the trees down in the neighborhood so did they wake you up at am or was it like no they were already awake I was already awake because I ve been sleeping on the couch for five days why oh my God does covert come with sneezes now I don t know is it the sneeze very I m not I don t know whatever there goes this episode with the coven marks Laughter it does anything at this point but like on the podcast apps it will say like misinformed information about covid and I m like we can t even say the word we have to flag our entire podcast for everything the world s ending and we re worried about well no I know people die from covet let s move on oh no you might want to come or not now we re drowning in this I ve had a bad day okay yeah and then when we got in the car to leave there s a A A car accident immediately on my road and I was like okay so I like turn around and go around the block and come back out onto the street and then there s another huge car accident that s just blocking off all of Burbank worst day for those people quite honestly you re right we should think about the victims so for minutes these people with their car accidents derailed my day and because it s a holiday she still showed up on time because there s no traffic actually I wanted to say like there was it wasn t no traffic there were people on the roads people are going to work today I don t think everybody has today off crazy you re crazy yeah look at us here working I know okay that s holding the workload on our back oh uh I woke up my A A cat this which one Louis Cheeto is a dream cat Cheeto is wonderful like yes Christmas has hurt his feelings but that cat has decided it doesn t like the litter box and I m like oh maybe it s because it s not with two cats maybe it s because it gets Fuller faster and this cat just like prefers oh like a clean clean slate to do anything but now I m in there every day twice a day making sure there s nothing in that and this cat is still choosing the most expensive rug in our house to pee on and I ve learned my lesson like I don t buy expensive rugs because I have five animals and I know that s like a whoop dee doo oh he keeps pigs not when I wake up to another pee stain in the same spot that I had carpet cleaned for an hour yesterday oh my God kick Louie s ass back out into the street and so while I m cleaning that Riley s in the backyard and then I m like weird where is she Riley where are you I can t find that girl yeah so I run up the mountain she s A A licking a mouse a live one I think she licked it to death there were no bite marks she licked it today and then she was laying right next to it that s kind of sweet and I m like this is disgusting was did you let her keep it so no oh I tore her away from it and then I took a shovel out in my backyard and threw it across the fence oh my God so that a rattlesnake or something will get it because I ve learned it s rattlesnake season R I P to a real rodent what I m just saying you re worried about the rodent he was trying to drive into my house and Riley was protecting me okay we also have a guest dog who keeps pissing everywhere in our house and I think it s because Joe and James aren t home so he doesn t feel safe no he can smell icky s piss from the last six months of life well he s been at our house before and he s never been like this but Joe and James are gone so icky is trying to protect us from Wolfie and so he just keeps being like and then Wolfie s like and then he just pisses everywhere so Wolfie is bubs Wolfie is a lot like bubs okay yeah because and bubs is the best dog in the situation bubs is being so chill wow that is shock yeah if bubs is chill until icky bites off a bit too much to chew and then bubs has to step in because they re like part of the same pack so he s like I don t want to do this Wolfie but this A A idiot started something and I ve got ta help him finish it because we re boys it s complicated dog politics so then I throw the rat over the fence yeah and I finally sit down and I m like oh my gosh I already woke up late I haven t produced this podcast everyone s showing up in a half an hour I m like but

like men s t shirts so take us into your Valentine s Day so picture Tuesday February th I wake up pleasantly in the arms of Mr Bubba s snuggled by Icarus ridiculous Joe nowhere to be found who is Joe uh Joe when I got on a flight to San Francisco and we went to San Francisco for two days and just A A around wow it was really fun we went to the aquarium we went to multiple aquariums actually and we re not really aquarium people but like I guess we are now and I learned honestly I haven t been like cool with Stingrays for like a minute because of what they did to my boy Steve you know what I m saying never forget wait am I do I know what happened to Steve do you know who Steve Irwin is oh oh my gosh is that how he died yeah he got Barbed in the Heart by a A A Stingray big one how is anybody going in the ocean well that s a great A A question because those are just sitting on the surf floor right like in where we re surfing yeah that s why I went surfing once and I probably won t go ever again I don t I get people love it and I just feel like I mean it was very fun but very dangerous it s a weird Factor The Stingrays is just crippling and now they re like seeing all these shorts these shorts not the shorts all the sharks even in Malibu and Santa Monica and I m like I don t I think I want to keep my limbs intact yeah I m good on that dog um so we when when I d seen the Stingrays I was like A A you for what you did to Steve you know what I m saying never forget like honestly some people be out in these streets forgetting and like I have not right no okay and then we went to this little like tide pool area where like kids are allowed to like pet things and there were like stingrays in it and I was like this is risky can they take the sting away from the ray no they always got the little Barb the Barb uh and children are petting these yeah but they were little you know what I mean they re like this big and then I realized like these things are really playful and like their heads when they poke up out of water kind of look like little Frenchy heads and they literally like they wan na socialize with you they re little little well they have these little side thingies they re like an odd shape right so their little side is they re just they like they come up out of the water in their little weird side just does a little hey a little wave of and they like come up to you and like ah because I I m not putting my hand deep into like something because it s as deep as like my forearm so I m just touching the surface and little the little guy s just like hey like just Wiggles his little head up onto my hand and I was like do I A A love a sting right I love a stingray I loved it so much I was like do I need a little stuffy do I need to bring home a fake Stingray and then have you ever seen one dried uh no why would I be in a position to see it they re A A aliens bro Chris can you Google Dried Stingray do they ever sting unprovoked because I know like when you re when people surf and they get stung it s it s most of the time because they step on one because what are you trying to say that Steve got Barbed because he was asking for it I m not talking about do you think it s because he was wearing those sexy short shorts dressed like that he got Barbed with that Australian accent are you ready yeah did they put a face on that thing no that s it will you screenshot that so we can put it in the episode yeah it s a A A hard yeah I don t like them anymore no I think they re still cute that A A is gon na be like the last of us and implant itself inside of our body and take over the world I don t know seems like we re all working together when we re full of that fungus towards a common goal connected Unified why are you sleeping on the couch because my mom s in my room oh but you said even when Joe was there or no no okay yeah Shane hasn t been sleeping in our bedroom either he s in his office can you imagine I mean are you low key loving it you look a little bit like your Loki well no because when they were doing our roof in sections and so the last section was over our bedroom yeah and so he had been and he sleeps late like I wake up before the first start and he s still that s like his sleeping hour so he s been sleeping in the other room and I m like of course we get married and you go and sleep on the other side of the house shouldn t he be coming back if the job is done uh yeah you would think so huh no he did he did one night he felt like I don t know he got like some sort of like Shane always is getting like some sort of stomach bug it might be the Takis he fell asleep on the couch and I was like Wow even after the roofers are gone you re just keeping this a pattern I see what s going on it was great we stayed home because I just I feel like on Valentine s Day in general if you don t know a reservation so far in advance you re never gon na get somewhere and even when you do go somewhere the service sucks because not because of the servers themselves but because they re so overwhelmed because it s so busy that we just you know had a cheat day because you know I m on my health Journey again so I had stop rolling your eyes every year you are too yeah you re always out there at your Orange Theory yeah and we ordered Mission Burrito what s Mission burritos oh my gosh you need to run there right after the show okay is it on the way home is it on the way home you got to get the bean and cheese burrito normally I m not just like a bean and cheese burrito girly yeah but you get that with their combination the rice and beans what s it called Mission chips yeah Mission Burrito I ll take you though it s real good so you got burritos he got me a really cute cake I saw the cake yeah and these flowers that are

it it s Saturday morning I deny her call because I m watching my new favorite show on Apple TV plus shrinking so good you like that show too Mom you re watching have you finished no I ve just seen two okay just two I watched four I love it I just I love it it s pretty cute with Jason Siegel yeah and what s it Harrison for Harrison Ford I served Harrison Ford juice after he got in that tiny little plane accident at the Santa Monica Airport how is he doing he seemed to be a little cut on a snoot I am hot for Harrison Ford I have to say he I really like all the characters like Daddy the comedy for me hits it s very like uh mom yeah like they re making jokes about next door and like like I m laughing at that of course yeah um but I do love it they re like therapists who are like facing their own trauma it s just like so it s like interpersonal relationships are so good for me but it s also like this glossy perfect show yeah I love a TV kitchen set you know the opening scene where he s in the pool with the girls oh yeah don t play it and then he realizes like he s like these are my friends and then he doesn t know their names he s like I could honestly live inside this world forever like I m gon na be so sad when I finish the season and I m campaigning for all of you to watch it so that it gets a season two because I don t know if I can live without the show anymore I ll watch it it s so cute yeah I did want to Circle back on Ginny in Georgia did you watch it I try I mean I I don t know it s not for you no no no I think it s good I just I m very curious of the audience because it s still like the number one show on Netflix but when I m watching it I m like is this for moms is this for teenagers like what s the demographic I think it s for something year old moms the limit does not exist I mean apparently no I just had never heard of it except for from you yeah apparently it s like this hugely watched show yeah and I m just like who s watching it if I ve never heard about it but apparently everyone yeah okay but I didn t like it Millennials Millennials what is it about a TV kitchen set that s just so great I don t know I think it s because it s like they can just spend all this time in that one set and they like really the trick it out I ve been on a few really nice A A kitchen sets some that don t have fourth walls some that do have fourth walls it s A A cool the colors are just so rich and vibrant what were we talking oh no idea you re right oh you re upset you didn t get to go on this hike and then I A A called you on the hike I did not because I m

Bruce because he overcharged and he over promised you know what I m saying so we re on the trail and I m like tripping I m like this A A and like you didn t answer and I was like starting to call you names and this guy Patrick who I don t know was like I felt him getting uncomfortable and I was like it s okay he knows what he is and then A A from behind Sean gay slurs I m not going to admit to that okay okay there Sean comes behind me up the trail and there he is and then the A A took his shirt off and then I noticed because I was like I could not be him you know what I mean right so I was like a lot of fit Boys in Hollywood so I started texting Rylan and I m like I need you to Google all of Shawn Mendes s tattoos because I can t do it on Friday and of course I m the one for this I go I go look and see if he has one on the back of his tricep and he A A does so we confirmed based off of tattoo technology that that was actually the Sean Mendes he was literally A A shirtlessed I was like Liz are you sure because like is it totally alone it was absolutely I was like it couldn t be no it wasn t like nobody had nobody else was talking about it and then two people came down and like I think it was I ever heard them talking I want to be like I have confirmed with my friend Ryland Adams you might also know him from such things as the zip podcast or rylan s blocks no but I was like you re wrong he would never go high this man went hiking alone not a friend he is like one of the most famous people I ve seen like Lucy Hale there that s where I see Josh all the time and then when I was leaving guess who A A yesterday guess who pulls up in his Tesla who Jason Nash oh well yeah that makes sense huge celebrity sightings uh you know who I saw when I was hiking in Malibu oh my god I

Sykes there too have you seen Hillary Duff there I mean there was another woman with them and I was probably hiking without my glasses it could have been Hillary I was hiking in Malibu the other day and I saw a Camille Grammer from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Camille Grimmer is the Kelsey up and she s like hi not because she knew me just because she s was because you were staring no because we were crossing a paths out and acknowledged each other s Humanities and then put your air pods back in and then I turned to Shannon and said to her Camille oh to Shane to Shane so you said she I was like who the A A is Shannon wow so you didn t say anything to him and I did not but I didn t learn how to spell his name sh oh yeah cause yeah you re crazy I spelled it on here it s s h a w n Sean yeah he did he debated he dated Camila Cabello for a long time yeah that doesn t mean I m not a spouse A A name or Camilla Cabello for that matter I think it s kamiya right no Camila um but is it not how you pronounce in is she all the girls I remember Camilla Cabello being on the James Corden show and she said the only A A reason she went on X Factor is because she was sure in her heart of hearts that she would get famous in Mary Harry Styles her whole motivation for going on X Factor was to Marry Harry Styles the woman can sing like yeah good for her when our podcast was still at Spotify when they were like announcing all their Spotify original podcasts yeah uh I was wearing a horrible outfit uh they re like guest performer there was Camila Cabello and oh my gosh can the girl

one meal kit okay what about anglerfish oh my God yes we have to go back to this I already did this I didn t even learn this at the aquarium by the way my friend Haley texted me like seven days ago and was like do you have a minute to talk and I was like are you okay like not really like are you okay but I ll call you if you need me to talk she s like no it s okay I just want to tell you an animal fact and I A A forgot about it last night I called this A A because she s like We re it doesn t matter I call her and she goes can I tell you that animal A A no and I go okay dude she s like do you know what an angler fish is and I was like no I don t do you no an angler fish is that fish that lives in the deep down the deep dark down that has the light that comes off the end and lures its prey in with its light and then you realize that you ve been lured right into its A A mouth but scientists apparently have had a really hard time finding male anglerfish that s a female angler fish the one with the light is the female and they ve never really found a male fish they re like how do these A A procreate this does not add up this is weird then science progresses research is done observations are made I m there male angler fish suckle on to the tummy of the woman and they strap on like a little A A parasite and then slowly every part of their fishness starts to atrophy they lose their A A eyes they lose their A A fins they just disintegrate on the A A base of this A A so procreating means death for the man uh huh and like I guess they dissolve into the woman and that is how they make babies I m probably wrong because Haley explained it to me very late at night and I was like text me that A A cause that is A A wild and you can t even read the textbook well she was like I have to send you the finding it now that s what I was gon na say she s like I have to send you the whole article I read on I was like I don t I can t read Haley that s why none of our voice memo that s why none of our hot topics are factual literally we see the headline and we re like let s go with it someone else has to read me the headlines sad sad but can you believe I can t believe terrifying also kind of an easy life for a male angler you just swim about until you disintegrate on a bitch s belly does it hurt is it painful I mean they have feelings I don t know okay well I feel bad saying they don t have feelings but even if they did have feelings like I wonder if I care about a male Angler s feelings yeah no more power yeah yeah what have you and your mom been doing having the house alone together oh we saw a really good rom com my mom is a rom com your place or mine Aficionado no not your place or did you see that trash we talked about this last week I can t do this with you and I have a bad memory okay of your engagement my mom s obsessed with Five Year Engagement she sits and shuts off with Emma Roberts Jason Siegel Jason Siegel and Emily Blunt and my mom literally has to stand up you would love it let me write this down what s it called engagement Five Year Engagement my mom stands five A A inches from the TV screen which is inches across which I don t know what you re seeing well a rom com is my kind of movie she laughed so hard her face turns red well okay it seems we have good uh we have similar tastes if we both are so in love with shrinking so I ll give it a try she s been talking about this movie for a decade wow and he refers to it actually there s like a little crossover accident you know all these movies he s in wow he s like Sarah Marshall Five Year Engagement I don t know what the other ones are I ve been sleeping on Jason Siegel I love him he s the one with Barbra Streisand which ones where they re driving in a car and she s his mom I forget what that s called um I watched Things I Hate About I m on this like old movie thing Things I Hate About You why don t they make movies like that anymore yeah like that Legally Blonde like they don t make like that is the essential function adult movies that are light hearted but entertaining with a great like they don t do that anymore Things I Hate About You is actually like what s it called mom when they take an old piece of work and they reboot it but it s like no it s like a class it s a remake of a Shakespeare play but it s not remake what s that word a ripoff no whatever it was great it s a it s the Shakespeare it s Shakespeare s Taming of the Shrew yes yes it is yeah Julia Stewart Julia Styles O is a fellow and so you guys re watched that movie that you re talking about I saw for the first time it s great I slept through the middle part and I still enjoyed the end and how much longer do the two of you have together today and tomorrow she s gon na do the bachelor recap with me wow do you watch no okay but you don t have to watch The Bachelor recap to enjoy my recap I was just wondering if your mom watched um okay let s get into some hot topics I don t know what changed with you last week but you always hold the iPad but last week you re like dropping the eyeball oh it s because my whole body was physically uncomfortable and it was making me like I was gon na A A burst I was like nothing has changed well it s like I don t know what s going on I m stepping on it because let me live I know but I m I m worried that you re gon na mess things up for us I feel like your concern for that is what s actually gon na mess things up and that is a life lesson in and of itself let me make sure nobody s at this house trying to get her bad concern for bad all right okay so in this is scary this is scary so there was this there were these guys and they were they were deep sea fishing and they were on their way home on an airplane from a deep sea fishing trip and the pilot goes like I don t feel so good A A passes out fully unconscious in the cockpit there s no one to land the plane I have no business on a plane with One Pilot you better get me two pilots or I will not step foot hell yeah never ever ever you know I think that s a really healthy boundary but this is an incredible story because these guys that were flying one of them stepped up to the plate yeah so the the pilot faints in the cockpit in the chair and they start nose diving into the ocean they re over the ocean and there s a guy on board whose wife is at home pregnant with their first child and he steps up and he says well we have to do something so first noticing that they re nose diving for the ocean he pulls up on the control and at an angle very gently very slowly and then he tries to put the headset onto talk to control the headset s broken he goes to his butt he s like would you please go calmly retrieve your headset so that I can discuss things with air control how is this man so knowledgeable though because he s like I know that if I would have pulled this up if I would have pulled the plane up too fast it would have stalled and then our wings probably would have snapped or something I m like A A how do you know so much about physics you sneaky A A and then it s like literally the the person who s interviewing him is like how do you know that he s like it s just common sense I guess it s like no A A if it was up to Common Sense we d be dead so I just thought that that was so funny when he s like I guess it s just common sense I was like it s really not what I loved about this interview though is he s like well were you scared like you have your wife at home and he s like not for one second did dying crossed my mind he was like I m just finding a solution and I don t know how a nose diving plane could not make you think of death yeah I mean I do get it though in some instances your first the first thing that your brain does is like how do I problem solve this you know what I mean yeah and adrenaline probably kicks in as well yeah and I you know I m re watching The Walking Dead and the the doctor man before he dies keeps being like he don t panic oh so now you re giving spoilers it s been out for years who cares it s been out for years also how did he know how to break when he or like slow down to the right speed to then be able to hit the brakes when he landed like I think the guy was coaching him I know but I would not somebody could be like okay here s the break on the plane and I d be like what you know what I mean and then he s like yeah I got a hang of the brakes once I was and I was like do you just want me to pull it in for you and they re like no just stop he s like I m gon na pull it in for you I could pull up to the tarmac or what s it called the gate I don t know whatever he was a classy guy that s an incredible story that is an incredible story good for him I died just common sense I guess no or maybe I just have none the same it s cute and then uh Jennifer Coolidge had to call the police because there was a trespasser at our house and he might still be at large and his name might rhyme with schmylin schmattams you re so mean would it not be you no I know how that feels and you were still down to cross that A A gate last week jump over the gate and go see Britney s house I was gon na do a hot girl walk in a neighborhood that s very different than jumping somebody s actually I mean like it s very different like a gate to somebody s home versus a gated community right you know what I m talking about right so I guess no machos act you would have popped the fence with him and you know it absolutely well I know something fun the two of us can do today I was shocked that you did it though and actually I was scared I saw oh God he s really gon na go well I would have but your daughter was just so you raised such a wonderful woman random helping a friend stay out of trouble I am and that s a hero an everyday hero People magazine should write an article about me common sense that actually gave me the idea for it great callback Mom let s do a little yellow box you can t hear what s happening there s a whole crowd cheering in our headphones sound effect I m hearing them all the time I have tinnitus why do you think I m so happy this is on fire I wish we had a camera on her and I m sorry I was scared you re so mean I wanted to protect her anonymity why you thought I was gon na start asking nasty questions like this she liked your husband no your mom said you re your mom said that someone was nasty to her in a Sam s Club after she started tearing up in your Vlogs and if anyone s asking my mom I m going to jail for A A murder well no I think it was in the comments like somebody made a comment about my mom s hair no your mom wanted her forever someone came up to your mom in Sam s Club and said that to her no I swear to God your mom said it on our podcast Am I Wrong Chris you were there you filmed it so yeah sure yes yes sure yeah anyway I m not trying to get my mom in that position okay I m not scared she ll take him my mom does have a concealed carry so if you come up on her you ve been warned and lots of Rage what I wonder where it came from this apple does not fall far from that tree right on um that also I my idea for our next film is predicated we need to figure out the first film I am gon na put in I got really good notes back from someone else about it and then I had a meeting last week with another person who s gon na connect me with a guy who packages movies and gets finances okay did you edit the sizzle no because I m ready because we went to the mall for five hours and spent three thousand you should edit the sizzle but it s got to be seconds well I m no I said I m ready to start taking control over my destiny oh you know and that means I do a lot of work well the movie thing has always been your lane I m ready to help your assist in that next week when I m motherless we can do that but like I am starting to like you know manifest a little more like I m in California who like who knows for how long but I need to start like making A A of myself yeah because I know like I made a good career for myself but I don t want it to end here yeah and like Ryan Seacrest leaving Live with Kelly and Ryan well you know she got a co host approval rights when the whole thing went down with Michael Strahan she has good taste and then she uh she left after they like blindsided her for after working at the network forever and she was like well I m not showing up to work until you guys renegotiate my contract and give me like the due diligence of somebody who has held the top rated Morning Show for years on your network good model God I love Kelly Ripa me too me and him which one Ryan her husband or her husband yeah I can t wait to see it s the Dynamics will be interesting though because it s like yeah working together yeah it s like hard you ll walk into they ll walk into work every day and the whole staff will know if there s an issue but you know because like you can feel tension like that yeah so and it s an everyday thing so I know I ll be doing work with my husband he s dead now no I m kidding he s not oh he s not Dad I m just kidding I actually worked with two of the three of them that s another story one of them is actually dead just for the record okay anyway here s a Ryland Segway Margot Robbie was talking about the so they announced that uh I just want to call our Glenda the Good Witch what s her name Lady Gaga Lady Gaga is gon na play Harley Quinn in the new Joker with Joaquin Phoenix I saw they like released the steel yeah I m not trying to like hate on Lady Gaga but doesn t she do the same thing in every acting role or no maybe she doesn t I don t know I didn t watch any of them I think she did something a little different in House of Gucci but I never saw it I well I did watch A Star is Born I really liked her in A Star is Born House of Gucci I couldn t get through and I thought I d be like all over that story but it wasn t Lady Gaga s fault no um so she took she s taking over the role for Margo no it s so it s like you know different people play Batman all the time different universes different people making different movies right so she is going to be playing the role of Harley Quinn in the Joaquin Phoenix Joker World well and I thought hmm weird why didn t they call Margo pack but then I saw it s a musical version and then it all makes sense it s a musical that s what I saw wow I didn t even jump that far into it but I do love that Margot Robbie said that she s super inspired by and lit by playing roles that are so iconic that multiple like a listers can put their own twist and spin on it and she likened it to Batman and Queen Elizabeth who everyone s played and like all of these different roles and when you look at Margot Robbie s roster like she s played a lot of those roles that have been played by multiple people like she s played Queen Elizabeth but I really loved the girl power behind the support in you know I have an iconic position in this world and I would love to see another icon make theirs iconic as well right because if you think about it like all the Batman s like they re they stand out you know everybody is known for their specific rendition of Batman whether it s hated or loved haven t seen any of them so I m just like the James Bond I tried to watch the other day the Batman with Jack Nicholson and it s A A weird it s like a Noir world it s like way too grandiose like I was like turn this the A A off for him like I was trying to watch the A A like Danny DeVito as the penguin like I ll give me A A Jim Carrey is the Joker like I m not trying to play these he because he plays Jack Nicholson plays the Joker I think but it was like way more like I think it s way more tied to the comic books because it s like straight up Mafia mobster vibes and it was just I m not I m not a mafia mobster Noir Vibe type of A A like unless it s Some Like It Hot I m not here for that I want to take back my A A talking of Lady Gaga oh from earlier in this episode yeah take it back no I just wanted to say like I m doing exactly I m like hating on her for having success in multiple Arenas and I love that like yes she hit like a pinnacle of being a pop star and then she was like I m not gon na be held in this box and I m gon na demand the world sees me in a different light and proved herself and then won an Oscar for it so I think it s incredible what she s been able to do and it s not easy like if you hit any level of success that doesn t mean it s easy to Pivot to a different lane or even maintain the level of success in the field you started in like a lot of people have hit TV shows where it s like the number one show on television and don t get another show so like good on Lady Gaga absolutely all right just wanted to clear it up and I I stand with everything you just said and I don t like it okay I don t know there s just things that she does sometimes they re like oh for A A sake A A okay I like kids do you care about Megan Fox anymore I like can t do it I can t either but apparently she she came back cheating and it s like girl well so I read a little further in to it and she s like I guess because everyone was speculating Machine Gun Kelly was hooking up with his guitarist and then the guitarist was getting all this hate so machine gun probably went to Megan and was like you ve got to like stop like speak out so this hate stops happening because she was like stop harassing the other people in this there was no cheating involved and I m like you re the one that made everyone thinking thought you re the one that made everyone think there was cheating involved because you did these dramatic posts on Instagram deleted all your photos with him and then deleted your Instagram it s like girl we re all thinking this because of your actions you can t just like say her actions while she must own them are a direct response of him being Sleazy mcsweezerson and that s fine but like she s do like the way she like okay if Shane did something that bothered me horribly yeah there s no way that I would immediately go to social media start burning A A that he gave me delete all our photos to get like I would really work well we don t know what Machine Gun Kelly did I know but it s like she was acting and listen I ve been there before where you like act out online in a state of just like like you can t believe not even Panic you re just so disbelieved by what s going on like you re like how can the world not see what s going on this is crazy but it is like these are adults and they probably should like pump the brakes pump the brakes like people are responding the way they are because of what she put out into the world and I vote like the last few weeks I ve been like I m on her side I m on her side I m on nobody like I still I still root for her but it s like I don t know I think this is all I mean I think it was a necessary thing to protect the guitarist Sophie right and I think it I think it probably took a lot of Courage for her to come back and post that and she d probably I feel like she had to be in a big headed space to do it because I would have never done that I would have I wouldn t have come back like I get deleting your Instagram to stop yourself from being a crazy person on Instagram right but no matter what I m just like but they re still sitting there together they re saying they re not not together okay see and then Sophie followed me on Instagram wait what so Chris is The Other Woman Sophie followed me on Instagram and I kind of freaked out why did she follow you on Instagram I don t know but she did I followed her back the second she just did she followed you first yes why did she watch the Shane Dawson podcast I don t know but I freaked out where did you where what s your connection I have no connection yes you do what do you mean open your Instagram I don t think it s fair that this Sophie girl was the one getting attacked I can t say that far uh but it s just like whatever I m going through your nudes too it s just like a I don t what are you doing why are we looking at this right now what are what are you what Lizzy we re on air I know we re on air but I want to see Chris s connection to Sophie oh we don t we ll do this after the podcast no this is relevant on air this is the most interesting thing about the whole A A story that so your mom agrees your mom s doing the same thing I m doing okay sound off in the comments below if you re A A curious why Sophie s following Chris because I m A A curious did she no I m happy for you Chris you looking at the the page just saying following you isn t gon na get to the bottom of No One s Gon na See the connection of how she knows to follow Chris at all how would you find that because if it s somebody that s posted him like one of his clients or something because she s an Instagram person herself right that s how Machine Gun Kelly found her she s a personality yeah she s a video creator okay yeah I m sorry I did that to you I m triggered by when sometimes you look at your phone and you try to find something for four minutes and then I m having to edit out three minutes of dead air oh my God you re not gon na forgive my apology oh my God no and the people won t either sound off in the comments below if you want to know because we ll never know wow as Connie I said I guess we ll never know I said I m genuinely sorry and we re still never gon na know and just to be completely honest sometimes the apology is not for the receiver okay I understand uh how this well I don t understand because I m not living behind closed doors in their relationship but I just think they need to pump the brakes on acting socially before they figure out how they re going to deal with their relationship yeah dude that could be a universal truth for everyone pump the brakes on social media before you figure out what the A A going on in your relationship okay I like it yeah we can unite on that I don t know Mom get your things also nice oh sorry the movie Vengeance we saw oh Vengeance hold on someone s at rylan s door hope we don t have to edit this out running down the phone Mom do you want to give a review of Vengeance the guy picking up the porta potty sorry I ll give a review of it did you guys just will you bring the mic a little closer to your mouth yeah uh I liked it we saw the movie Vengeance written and directed by B J Novak and Mom liked it and Lizzie liked parts of it I also slept through a majority of that film liked it though I just wish we could make up we re still friends your mom agreed with me BTW I don t know if she understood what was going on that could be fair she s not on the gram I know but when we re just stalling doing nothing it s like pick it up right like acknowledge okay whatever we re moving on some of us are moving on some of us will never move on some of us will never forget uh oh oh what just her I think we we don t need to harp on it I was reading what her response was got it and then this next one Mom you can weigh in on this because we saw the Allison Brie Dave Franco romantic comedy called somebody I used to know and it was written by the married couple and I thought of us by the married couple Dave Franco them together they re married and Allison wrote it they wrote it together she starred in it and he directed it so and they decided upon who to cast as her lead opposite yeah together who was the man I don t know his name did they have good chemistry they did he was great everybody was be I honestly only know Allison Bree s name and so Alice the story is Allison Brie says it s not that weird having husband Dave Franco co direct her sex scenes yeah so what s going on here is it s a romantic comedy so no matter what her character is going to be A A someone kissing someone and romantically inclined with someone and you know they wrote it together so they know what all of those scenes entail and uh Dave s directing it so it s like you would think it s super weird to have your husband in the room being like grab her there like in the interview she was like the priority is the relationship that people are watching on screen because I m an actor and that s my job but I m sitting back here and I m Dave Franco and I m like well if he gets a boner then I m gon na go like rage him yeah like you know but then if I m the actor I m the one getting the boner and I m like Dave Franco s here while I have a boner for his wife and if anyone were to get a boner it would be Rylan because he scares himself hard all the time and another quote of her she said it s like we work in this strange job that requires ultimate vulnerability and at a moment s notice it s what we signed up for and I m like well if you re being that vulnerable with another person like what if there s a genuine connection that is undeniable it s just like scary business and it is why I think a lot of actors end up together like co stars yeah because the faux chemistry turns to real chemistry and I do think that there s something to be said about like so like true vulnerability is different right behind closed doors no cameras around no script no character vulnerability with a partner is different than onset vulnerability but I think even if the wording is different you re still bringing it from a very personal yeah personal place and I think a lot of people get confused but like Brad Pitt and Angelina are divorced you know what I m saying yeah like it is I mean a lot of my friends that are actors they re like a lot of movies good or bad feels like summer camp because you like get thrown in to the wild with these people where you re with them for hours a day for three months on end and it s like you re you learn everything about their life and then the movie ends and everyone s on to their next project so you likely don t see them them for another few years and it is like you build these hyper um unrealistic intense relationships with people that might work out in the long run but also might not so it s just like a testament to their relationship to be able to be confident in them kissing I agree if I signed up to be an actor I think like yeah there s gon na be kissing involved and Shane has to be cool with it I know you have a little bit of an opposite standpoint well it s it s kind of funny because like Joe and I did a bunch of sketches a few years back and we just kept hiring my friend Alex to play this male part and I was playing the girl parts and every character had to kiss so then it turned out that I would just text Alex and be like or Joe would like text Alex to be like hey can you come kiss my wife on camera again Laughter but it was it s never weird like Alex has a wife outside of it it s like right you know it s also they weren t super vulnerable moments because they were like Montage moments where well speaking of kisses did you see the fake kiss and you people on Netflix I so I I heard so the there s a movie called you people written by Jonah Hill and someone else starring Jonah Hill and like Eddie Murphy s in it and it s about a mixed race couple who are getting together and the white family me blending with the black family is it s a bumpy meshing as my mom would say but I see them kissing a lot in the movie so I wonder why they decided for like because I didn t see the movie I had no idea what it was about but it kept coming across in like headlines that this thing was fake and so I started watching like out of context of the movie Just people talking about the antics of the scene being fake but it seems like that scene is like the Pinnacle of the movie like all roads lead to this scene it s predictable so it seems weird that if for that scene they didn t execute on the kiss if they had in other parts yeah because I only watched the movie to get to the scene of the fake kiss because my friend was texting me about and she was tripping and I put it on it s like well these A A are like smooch kissing while they brush their teeth other real kisses that s what yeah and so I m just like I m confused by there being a seat like I wonder if there was like a kobit scare or something I don t know but it s even harder for me to believe that this woman s interested in Jonah Hill because his charm to me is a little bit rusted in the movie in at this chapter of his life I feel like he s coming across as a different kind of character well I haven t seen anything of him recently I think he used to be like incredibly soft and sweet and funny and charming and vulnerable and Matt Hollywood got the best of him people constantly commenting about his body people constantly commenting about how their idea of who he should be yeah I think in a similar way I know he really doesn t like people talking about his body but like Rebel Wilson also just came out and said like well I didn t lose weight for years and years and years because it was in my like in our contracts you have to stay within a pound range of where you were for that movie and it was like multiple movies I have Pitch Perfect I saw everyone taking that headline so out of context like it was like Hollywood really being damaging to her and she s like when she actually said it it was like on call her daddy and she s like it s very standard like I signed up it s not because they like wanted her to stay fat it s because they wanted her to stay the character they hired her as and she didn t seem to have like a huge chip on her shoulder about it but the media took it and spun it like that yeah I m sure she would have preferred that she could have gotten healthier when she wanted to whatever that meant like food body whatever but I feel like I bet Jonah Hill s charm has also dwindled with the weight of the public just oh I m I m sure too but I also think he s an incredible actor and I it was an interesting choice for him to make a rom com at this point right I mean I so he did write it he like wanted to make he executed on making this I just thought it was so funny that they re like faces meshed together so you see the CGI Yeah well yeah I watched like I watched a special effects Channel talking about it and it was dirty stuff yeah dork nerdy stuff nerdy stuff anyway what the A A is going on with Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny and why is the internet so mad at Kendall always can I just make a confession what I don t think I know who Bad Bunny is I don t either he s a rapper I think he s like one of the biggest artists in the world right now yeah that s fine I just saw all these headlines and everyone was nasty about Kendall Jenner and it s like what are they being nasty about just that sh they re like they re so mad that like somebody of bad Bunny s status would stoop low to Kendall Jenner I m like Kendall Jenner is like a world renowned model yeah she s done very well for herself like she s not not a catch I don t know why the internet gets so mad at these girls for everything I don t either it s crazy it is crazy I don t know Bad Bunny but I have seen the internet getting mad at Kendall Jenner thinking that she s editing her photos because her fingers look elongated in a bunch of things but then somebody took the time to like find a bunch of pictures of her hands elongated like that s just Kendall s hands she has freak hands and it s also probably why she struggles to cut a cucumber she has beautiful hands she s she s built different I paint I ve painted her hands they are oh no Kendall Jenner s hands yeah wait well not her physical hands but I ve copied her my mom s painted Kendall Jenner mom painted Kendall Jenner and then showed it to me she s like look I painted Kourtney Kardash I

about the Titanic well if you do did you read the article I tried it didn t catch my interest or maybe I just didn t understand or maybe my morning was hectic and I had people ringing my door I think your morning was hectic because this is so gnarly so there s a Titanic anniversary that s upon us or something because people are talking about Titanic again April th so April April I think it s like April th or something that the Titans all the facts about Titanic because you know every bit of trivia because I love it why does Robin know because I love the Titanic because I had to read you all those books over and over and over that s all you wanted to hear yeah I love the Titanic before there was a movie about it when the Titanic sunk yeah was it the th April th April th Thursday what if everyone on that ship all those rich A A were just trying to avoid taxes that s the conspiracy theory anywho while they were filming the Titanic there was a night on set where some they were like one of the meals they had was like lobster chowder and people start eating the lobster chowder and then they start having a horrible reaction to it like they re getting violently ill some people are hysterically laughing some people are hysterically crying they all start going to the hospital James Cameron Bill Paxton s all A A up someone put PCP AKA angel dust in the A A Lobster chowder and poisoned the entire set why wow no one to this day knows who or why and how long did it take the film out of commission it didn t they worked later that day and then I was thinking about I was like A A A A that is a rough A A life you get dosed on PCP and you have to go back to work do you know how excited I d be like well guess that s the day they re like wrong A A this ain t covered by Insurance you re showing up this movie s million dollars it s no breaks wow all gas wow yeah I heard people talking in Tick Tock lingo in real life for the first time last night and my mind was just who well we went to it s really fun actually it s like an all vegan sushi restaurant and I m not vegan but it s like very fun Shane okay somebody else had introduced me to the restroom uh and I guess it s like because Trevor Travis Barker lives in Calabasas and he s vegan like and so now they open to Crossroads which is like the world s most famous vegan restaurant but I guess there s this all Chris has probably been there because it s in or maybe you haven t but it s in Agora Hills and it s uh right next to that uh Mexican restaurant that we had talked about before anyways it s uh it s really interesting and really good definitely not like healthy because it s but it s weird because it s like it s like all rice and fruit I don t know like that did you have the watermelonahi I need to take you there just because it s like such an experience it s like so crazy that they make like it tastes like sushi and it s so realistic but it s vegan anyways uh yeah these two like younger kids came in and they were like only talking like they like I was watching Tick Tock and it just I couldn t believe it were they talking to you no they were talking to each other but the tables are so close in that restaurant that I m just like what did they say drop a line like everything that you could ever I can t even do it it s a new dialect it s a new dialect oh my God and now I feel like were they like fat did they say butt butt bet everything they say about it is are you guys still saying bet are you guys who are you I don t know I m just asking see okay we got ta go okay we re not gon na do

Music so Music hello hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay and my biggest nightmare has come true we re virtual again and it could not have been a bigger nightmare on my end and i tried canceling on lizzie um probably five times i have to say thank you so much for pulling through because the A A that you have just had to deal with is way too much well it is all my fault and i take responsibility for my own doings because lizzie and i were supposed to record two full episodes before i hightailed it out to colorado but for some reason shane and i like this is what we always do every time we go like when we go to colorado or california we just decide together all of the sudden we say i think we need to go right now and i go yeah i think we need to go right now too and then you re like the dads that go out for cigarettes and never come back like literally we packed all of our stuff and in seconds were on the road and just left our house so i have no explanation we re going to be together next week because shane and i need to go back to record an episode of his podcast a couple episodes of our podcast and here we are i and you have to meet your god son oh okay lizzy has huge exciting uh news and well why don t you just take it away we got jelly a puppy well okay i think you need to bring them along on the journey before you okay come on first off let me just give you a little back behind the scenes here i have jelly and she s warming up the puppy pen and then over here i have bubs and he s uh holding it down oh he won t get focused weird i just had to lock her ass up because she needs constant supervision and it was just easier to put her in the puppy pen um anyway so jelly s been battling cancer for about two years and she was in remission for a really long time and we were really lucky to have that time and then uh early this year the tumors started reappearing which means that the medication we were using stopped working which is devastating and why i ve been on my sad girl A A so she basically has like a big mass on the side of her face that makes her look like a as we say punkin hid or a hammerhead shark um and this is after the beautiful girl already had to get one eye removed as well which honestly is iconic cute as a cyclops like honestly she she s the she s the frenchie that was made for one eye like she carries this with such dignity and grace and beauty um so yeah so we ve been trying a bunch of different medicines to see like what our options are treatment wise and uh we eventually landed on one that can t reduce the tumors but hopefully it will stop their growth and will stop their progression um but we had to take her off of a few different medicines because of x y and z reasons and she was you know pretty you know she s peppy she s happy she s comfortable she s not in any pain she s living her best life we make her boiled chicken and steak four times a day whenever she asks for it uh and we re with her so that she doesn t have to wear a cone to worry about scratching her tumor but we had a puppy over at the house on friday and she lit the A A up like jelly lit the A A up she lit up she was up barking playing sniffing this puppy s business was her business bubs liked the puppy bubs doesn t know how to play like he s broken emotionally and that s why i love him i m not even allowed around bubs because he hates me so it s like the fact that bubs liked another animal is shocking and i m praying for uh your fan your new family to get along they re dope they re i think it s going to go really well because the new dog is going to be a little bit smaller than jelly jelly s like pounds this puppy s parents are both only so he s gon na be like a little loaf and when they when we facetimed with them they re like he s shorter than the other dogs we re like yes you got the wrong yeah we got the right they re like do you want to see his tummy we re like show us his A A tummy he is the have you decided on a name because what s his name as of now his name on the listing was zingo which is not bad it s pretty cute it s pretty cute he looks like joe i didn t notice that but they do say people choose dogs that look like themselves and every time i go hiking i do if i m ever by myself i like to rate how close on a one to ten ten skill how can i know i know when to tell how close the dog looks to the owner i didn t recognize that immediately your recording failed hey everybody how you two been how you doing pawdience you guys doing good i don t know about this i honestly we re in potty youth tell us you re good because we struggling out in these streets when god gives me signs i need to listen to them elizabeth and i need to stop trying to uh overcome what the world has planned for me and here s my thing is i oh and now my my computer s literally about to die ah does he have a charger in here i m in shame this is the thing see what just happened was a big A A up and now i m getting a sign that my battery is literally dead and gon na die and i keep getting these signs here s the deal we have to list the signs because they re not in on the journey with us this morning we start i i m going to charge her hold on you can talk here s how it started it s the middle of the night thursday rylynn texts me shane and i are leaving we re getting a pack of cigarettes and we re never coming back your dads are out and i was like no not mine s abs who s gon na raise me so then we were supposed to record two episodes today or yesterday today s tuesday at ryland s house but then he was gone abandoning me and all that he holds dear which is essentially only me and uh then i was exposed to covet but morgan s staying at his house so i had to go get all the podcast equipment and then i bring all the podcast equipment home and we set it all up and then rowan s like i don t really want to do it and i m super stressed about it and then it stops working well hold on i was stressed out because yes it was an impulse decision for us to leave to colorado but i thought oh we ve done virtual times we can do it again everything will be fine but i didn t anticipate what the exhaustion of driving like in one day was going to be and then you did it in one day well we did it in essentially hours we did sleep at a hotel for a second and the hotel was a dog hotel and our room smelt like something was rotting under the bed and it was such a nightmare but it was a fun experience but i didn t realize i was gon na feel hungover for three days after and then like trying to get the house in order because we hadn t been here in a second trying to get everything uh back up and running i just haven t had a second and then it was memorial day so i of course wanted to see my family which was so fun but i woke up and then my vlog like isn t working that needs to be uploaded in an hour and i m just like oh my gosh i should have canceled when i knew i needed to cancel but i then was like well this is lizzie s job too i can t just cancel her job because i m an inconvenient A A and uprooted and i just got a puppy ah she just got a puppy but then so um my podcast equipment wasn t working and that s when i like threw my phone at the wall and texted lizzie and was like i literally don t know if i can do it today because you remember last time it was doing that hiss noise so this microphone was broken and then i called lizzy and then we re like i was like okay i can get myself together and we can do this and then we start we get on and the A A technology s like you shouldn t do this today yeah my side won t record who knows if this is even recording we should have recorded the screens for this with our phones because honestly i m terrified that the second the upload hits it s gon na be like lizzy s A A is A A so then lizzy s thing went out and then i was echoing for A A minutes while we were trying to record and it was not usable and then after all of that my computer was gon na die so god keeps saying hey ryland don t podcast this week i wonder i wonder what you were going to say that was going to be a cancelable offense honestly i think this is just us being protected from ourselves you know that s what i think too but like what were you going to say what were you going to do that was going to ruin our lives Laughter oh my gosh jelly s finally A A snoring and her little puppy done getting it ready for her little baby cute little mama bubs is out of focus is that because he s a demon yes do they even know what s coming for them i keep screaming at them we got you guys a baby and they re like stop yelling and i m like a baby and they re like we don t understand and i m like i love you and i i have like oh i have so much i want to talk about with the dog i was asking if you re prepared to do like what it takes to be a new mother but you know what i feel like i don t know should we make this an instagram exclusive minute show and then pop back next week maybe i m still not like positive it s gon na upload like i m so scared well that s what i mean so like the like should we keep even going because i have some good things like we have some good things on the docket that are worth while like we have some worthwhile stories here but i don t know if i m ready to share them on this sort of technology i want to try until my side is like you re A A today s podcast is sponsored by doordash we know you ve got back to back meetings errands to run and chores to take

the desk like well no he was A A in a litter box on top of the desk but no it stunk before right when we walked in the room we were hit with a whip of like there is a dead body hiding under the bed and so i thought oh this is fine i ll just crank open the window but there wasn t a window to crank open and i turned on the air in the fan nothing helped and it was crazy because you walk right outside of the room and there s no smell so i thought wow we just got a stenchy room which was honestly a blessing in disguise because it made me want to get up at the crack of dawn and hit that road again to get here as soon as possible but wow it does feel great to be back in colorado we re like living loving having a great time the only problem is we both set up uh lives for ourselves again in la like i have you there shane has his podcast now that his co hosts are there and it s like what am i doing with my life is the real big question i was thinking about that logistically we could do a thing where it s like me and chris come i go home and jared replaces me and sleeps in my dirty bed sheets in that order honestly it s fine we just weren t able to get schedules to align after we had already committed we executed our plan too quickly because we had booked our hotels for our road trip thinking that it was going to work out schedule wise for everybody to make a trip out here and that didn t pan out like we thought it would like getting everyone to which is a big ask on our end you know it s like we re the ones that are the big stupid boys that decided that we needed to live in a different state big boys here we go we do love visiting you i have to say and people who don t know that like i do a podcast with you i m always like oh i m traveling for work and it makes me sound like a dignified lady it s mick away this works this works oh it s here did i just ruin it is that the bad look is this like cheers with the water glass nothing is quite as it seems today as good as it seems we can t get anything going the way we want it to i think we should make an exclusive igtv and then be back together next week absolutely when i have a A A puppy and then yeah the puppy will come with you my dogs won t be there so we ll have a safe environment the one thing i m uncomfortable about is how many rattlesnakes you have on your property we ve never seen one uh yeah because they re sneaky they re sneaky snakes and i m not like trying to bring my two two well i might have to bring all three of my dogs because i can t bring one oh my god i have three dogs does that make me crazy well that s what i was asking you are you prepared to be a new dog mom because it is a lot the only time shane and i have really like butted heads in our relationship is when we re potty training dogs and it s not even budding heads it s just like it s so exhausting that every time you walk out there s A A on the carpet that it s like both parties are frustrated which i know is like a fraction of what parenthood for a real child is going to be but still it s it s uh it s taxing i joe and james have had a pup like joe and james got jelly as a puppy i haven t had a puppy in years so the answer to your question is no and everything on the internet is telling me that french bulldogs are particularly A A stupid and that potty training them is an absurd task which is why i have this puppy pen so i can keep it wherever i go and it s small and i can move it and if i need to keep jelly s badass in it too i ll do that as well i also was gon na get a puppy bjorn and just wear him around but if i warm around it would make jelly sad so i m not going to do that well i m very excited for you i mean it s going to be so incredible for you and i m so excited that jelly s going to have really a caregiver role in this position she s going to have a whole new lease on life because she s going to have somebody to teach how to be her exactly and uh we call her mama because she like mothers us so she s finally gon na have i feel like an A A for denying her this puppy for so long because i was like no that s crazy we can t get a puppy we have to help jelly and then i see jelly with this puppy and she s like the only thing that will help me is a puppy and i m like get it joe get the dog right now it took five seconds for me to say okay joe you can get a puppy and he was like okay and i was like but we re not doing a frenchie like i can t handle this pain again like they re the best dogs but it s the biggest heartbreak i can t do it and he s like i m not gon na deny myself the joy of a puppy frenchie because you re hurt and i was like okay get a front sheet and then he went to sleep and in the morning when he woke up i was like so i ordered a frenchie i m excited i m looking forward to motherhood i m so excited and it could be happening in t minus two days so jesus christ i know that s one of the reasons why i needed to do this podcast because i ve i it s time is moving so slow for me right now because i m so A A excited and you were like i can t do it it s like well what am i gon na do now i ve been i m awake i ll just go sit and wait by the door like should i just go to the airport now hmm i guess you could come here before your puppy gets here oh my god i would be so grateful why didn t i think of that i don t oh because i was exposed to covid oh right do you have coveted you know what i m going to tell you something that is going to really upset you i think i ve had coped for what do you mean like in retrospect i think i ve had covet i think i m over covered now but i think i had it for like a week or two but i was very low symptoms so i didn t know well okay it will be even because you potentially i potentially gave you norovirus and you you you escaped that even though i breathed right into your mouth and you had to know what it gave me but i just had no idea you know what i mean like i had no idea until joe until james s parents were like oh yeah we have cove and i was like we gave you coverage you know it s hard to know it s not funny this is it this is the cancelable conversation well no i mean i know covert is very bad because i m laughing because i m terrified and uncomfortable and the problem is when it s mild symptoms because it s like it s been around for so long if you get mild symptoms it s like well are we just or are we sick and that s really the rub it was super so like i and by the way i didn t give james s parents coved they flew out to san diego and the second they landed they were sick as dogs and then they came up here and james had a cold and he s like oh it s just a cold it s just a cold like you know we re vaccinated we you know we think we re safe uh but then like you know we go down the list of his symptoms and it s like you re still sick like you might have coped and then his parents go and get tested because they re very sick and it s covered and so we re just i m realizing like oh i kind of had mental fog like oh that diarrhea wasn t like my normal diarrhea it was different that diarrhea hit like covey diarrhea like oh that headache was was weird that was a weird headache you know like now that i m thinking about it i had some gnarly headaches for a while too but it was leading up to my neck pain and i thought after he cracked my neck he released the tension that then stopped the crazy headaches i was having but maybe he might be coming on your birthday we didn t even do any oh my god we went to six flags elizabeth i m so sorry and i was like hand sanitizer addicted that day because everything i touched i was like got ta get my hand sanitizer but you did eat those doritos with your fingers licked them cleaned you did i brought my chips home okay now that we ve gone for this long we might as well get into some of our some of our things and at least have like a quick i listen to a podcast that they do quickies on thursdays so let s have a quickie podcast um do you want to talk about our workout class from hell the last time we saw each other in person before i so decided to exit california ryan and i decided to take a workout class together nowhere on the workout like itinerary did it say it was a A A michael jackson theme day we re in there we re getting ready we re putting our A A in lockers and this A A comes out in a full blown A A black glitter sequin smokey jacket sequin with a fedora everything she s got gloves on i m like what are we doing here it s a dark ass room no we didn t come for this then they they continue to play like all the worst A A jackson five songs at top volume for an hour well i kept looking at lizzy like i need to plug my ears because she s not only screaming and rambling and talking for A A five minutes without a breath i was like lizzie we might have to leave this class dude it was awful it was legitimately awful soulcycle has the soulcycle has the audacity to let you know when it s a themed class which i like michael jackson music but when i m working out to it for an hour straight it s just not what i would have signed up for and i guess that s the gamble you take when you go to locations of fitness studios that you ve never been to before but lizzy looked at me like she was never gon na hang out with me again yeah no it was awful i kept looking at you like should we leave and i kept saying well my car s getting serviced so i m just gon na wait no matter what but okay very entertaining of us i know what a great story do you want to talk about your sunburn before we go yeah i have a horrible sunburn i was out playing with the puppies and i was sitting outside and literally i get A A horribly burnt so when rylan calls to tell me he s fled town i m laying on a bag of frozen spinach crying and you didn t you re like sunscreen queen every time i look to you and i m like oh lizzy i mean you put sunscreen on in the parking lot at the A A workout place and you pulled out a ziploc baggie filled with five different sunscreens of all different orientations i m like okay so how did you not think to put sunscreen on and are you recovered you know what i never hit record what i hear i never hit record on the road caster oh you don t have to okay sorry i just had another panic attack i uh it s one of those days when you walk for me i forgot to record like i forgot to put up that screen no mess and so what happened like what was the end result you said this is going to snowball into something so where do you go from the sunburn oh i bought a puppy that was the response to the sunburn i just in a panic couldn t sleep laying in their itchy burning and agonizing pain scream crying and also everyone in my house was really over my scream crying jose literally said he s like sometimes i hear things and i think it s like you scream crying and then it is and i m just like can everybody just mind their own business does everybody need to be tapped into my scream crying james is like i heard you crying last night like shut up well joe probably really wanted to get the puppy because he thought that it might bring new life to you and less sadness because there s more going on he s probably like i don t even want a puppy i want my wife to stop scream crying and being so sad because i will say like as much as i feel for jelly and it is very sad like your life is consumed by this because your dog has cancer and that s what happens i mean it s a million vet appointments you have to be home at all times like we you can t really leave your house because you are full time care for your dog which is like you are such an outstanding dog mom i m happy to do it nothing brings me more joy never have you ever complained about it like you re happy to drive an hour and a half to your specialist appointments and do all of these things but i do think like getting a new puppy i think will be so good for the entire family and maybe you ll scream cry one time less a day well the funny thing is is the second i was like yeah let s get it and i was like but he s gon na die someday joe was like you re the only A A i know who cries about a dog she doesn t even know yet ten years he s gon na not be well it is heartbreaking justice for all dogs to live longer lives for god s sakes but i get why heaven needs them because honestly like they we don t deserve them that s the truth they re just the A A watch me start crying okay before we go because this won t be topical next week i wan na just hit on the this is us finale okay the the girl who started watching two of the episode before and now she s like full on invested texting me live updates but what were your thoughts on the finale i mean i loved it because i have a big problem with death personally like i never get over it and so like even within yeah i mean everyone has a problem with animals dying as well but like the stranger bird i killed while driving and not just cried full blown like oh had a breakdown the world ended um so i loved when what s the not the guy that broke chrishell s heart what s the other triplet s name oh sterling king k brown is his real name uh what s his name in the show sterling s character is like crying to his children like what s it all about like randall my mother randall my mother s dead and yet here i am and i the birds are chirping and my and i m hungry and i m and everything goes on like what s the point of it all right bubs is having a reverse sneeze what s the point of it all it s a reverse sneeze from your little chawini um and then his daughter who s got a spoiler alert in three two one i have chills right now i m just thinking about it the daughter s like i m having a baby and i m naming it after your dad who i never even met because your dad s principles were instilled in you and you instilled them in me and i m gon na instill them in my child and that s the meaning of life and i was like that ain t it if that ain t it oh man i was like wow did i just find a reason to keep living and it really to be a good person maybe like to just like do good unto others on this walk home of which we were all taking with each other and then i was asking a stranger on the internet i m just kidding the first part that got me like really uh was the sibling sitting together after it had all happened and kate s like oh are we going to drift apart now and it s just like oh because they don t have their father has passed their mom has passed they no longer have like because that is kind of a driving force of holidays and stuff and then when they re all like oh no we re the big three and like we re gon na stay together if we re all together and i just so heart wrenching and incredible i will say well i had i did take a picture of me ugly scream crying to that episode which i ve never done i ve never like cried and took a photo of myself before so i really felt like a trendy uh person on social media um i was like i should because i had tear like a lot of times i m convulsing like but i m not like having full tears running down my face and with this finale i really did i will say i liked the second to last episode more and my reasoning for that is because the kids the younger kids haven t been in the series in a couple seasons now and i haven t been like with them in that state of life for a long time and while i thought it was an incredible uh feat that he thought forward to the finale to record with those kids years ago it just like i personally like being in real time with them more and so but i really did like the finale and i went to the bathroom after i had to pee and i just thought wow what am i going to do now mourning the loss of this that i ve been with for six years every single week no now you need to be a dad like milo well i will but who what show will i watch and cry along it s just so beautifully done the way they time hop through history and the past and connect their story lines together there s just nothing like it on television and it s just like so sad for me to see this go do you want to share your scream cry picture so you don t have to put assets in this is me watching this is us you had to watch it in the middle of the day see i m the kind of person when i really like a show i have to like schedule out the time i m gon na watch i have to be in a good mood i have to be well rested but i need to no i m not going to be interrupted and that s how you know for me the show is incredible and this is us is that for me i had to do it while joe was out of the house because he told me i wasn t allowed to watch it after i screamed cried for the first episode i took a lot of things oh this is like so embarrassing and you can like see up my nose let s see show it for longer and then i ve been just mourning the loss ever since like i just let s do cry girls together and i tried to replace the void with a new show on well not a new show on netflix but i keep hearing people talk about it so i tried it it s called heart stopper and it s like it s a little bit like love victor where it s like some moments are a little too cheesy but it is beautifully crafted like the soundtrack and visually and it s like it s very fun gay show so for all you younger gay people out there i m glad you have something to look up to and watch not even look up to but it s so fun to watch did you watch the baby i tried because you told me to i put it on but then you have to get onto the first episode well they have english accents and i just i can t hear it i don t know what it is about me but there s something wrong with me where i literally can not hear it unless it s jim dale or harry potter talking i can t hear an english accent excuse me disburped whatever it s been a while since we ve had a belch on air um also is there do you have one hot topic that you love love love that you can t part with did you watch cardi b watching a yacht sink what the A A that was so wild you feel like both sinking is like such an s event but it s like no happens all the time like cruises went up in flames you won t catch me on a A A boat anytime soon boats are so scary and my dad wants to go on a cruise for his th or th next year oh my gosh well you know joe and i go on those old people cruises and we always go on carnival and a carnival boat recently caught fire and joe came out and like showed me the video of it burning and he s like do you think this is choosing fun because that s their slogan she s fun also if you fall off board like if you get the odds happening are slim to none it happens more than you think you should i think people are going out on youtube i don t think people are falling i think people are jumping i m also not going to youtube it that s crazy well and that s the thing and that s my problem with shane i love him so much but like he he looks into trash like into tragic things that are possibilities a la planes boats anything that could go bad he watches a million videos on the worst case scenario and that s why he gets these crazy fears and then they get passed down onto me like i think when you re like an anxious dog parent you like you re not anxious the dog gets anxious i m starting to buy proxy get these fears that shane has shane s also got to stop doing that like you guys believe in manifestation like don t be A A doing that and that s an order i do love the specifically cardi b commentary on about sinking because she is so wild it s my favorite thing like take away the boat going down just like her reactions to anything and everything is why we need her in the world she s when they go looking for the ship she goes a whole yacht sinked in front of our face that A A in bikini bottom i love how she s like oh my god they can t do nothing about it there s no big bug like honestly if i ever have a horrible incident in my life if cardi b is A A commentating it it s whatever let me see if this audio will play Music bye bye bye Music oh my god it s too much it s so funny funny i mean she said that i guess there were no like everybody safely exited before it had sunk so like save your hate for cardi um it gave us a good laugh and i think with that we ve been recording for minutes we have a good five minute breakdown before this if your recording made it to life um i m so sorry i told lizzy and part of my thing is like even my dad the other day when i saw him yesterday he goes you and lizzy have been stand out funny the last few episodes like i ve been laughing out loud more than ever during your podcast and that s why i started thinking too like oh i can t give the people a virtual episode after my dad s been laughing out loud at us so then i just got two in my head about it and then i started freaking out about it so next week we will be together again and even though we re on different we re not on different coasts even though that s what i would like to tell everyone even though we re in different states uh we re gon na make it work lizzy likes to travel to me i m gon na be more forth uh coming and traveling to her i don t even think that makes sense but you know what it s okay well we weren t here for that very long but no and here s the deal even if it didn t record i have to say this was a very enjoyable conversation that i had with you my friend and i appreciate it because it killed time between now and my puppy okay well i hope you all found something to enjoy about this episode and thank you for supporting us through our um what would you call this growing dreams cardi b should have commentated on this entire exchange if she s on cameo maybe we can pay her to do just that oh my god can we drop like A A grand to have cardi b be like oh my god this podcast up in flames oh my gosh i was just thinking how much it would cost to have cardi wrap us like a second intro like it s been a year okay well maybe we could get somebody a little we

i m i m shocked honestly yeah i ve been holding this in for a little bit and i started combusting and when we were walking outside in the garage and i was like what because i m really not good at this A A you guys i know and she s been asking me so my birthday s this upcoming weekend and she goes can i kidnap you on your birthday and i was like lizzy i don t know what that means and she goes exactly what i said can i kidnap you on your birthday cause i was just gon na straight up A A snatch you well i was like rip you off the streets and take you somewhere but then i realized that might be more fun for me than it would be for you and i didn t want to like ruin your birthday well and that s the thing i didn t know how long this endeavor would last and then five hours you said five hours i said no then you can t do that on my actual birthday because i don t know what it is and no so we settled on sunday the day after but what is it don t do that to me are you joking am i going to like it i think so i m not good with surprises like i asked shane i asked jane and he said you d like it i asked him if he knew and he just turned away from me ah he played it cool yeah i mean yeah he didn t tell him did you know that he knows something well i said did she tell you and he said yeah and then he walked away good for him i couldn t have if joe asked me something i d be like these are all the words you need to know but yeah i m gon na get you on sunday you can tell me when okay earlier is better okay so it s something that isn t time specific yeah earlier is better you re going to want to wear sunscreen you re going to want a hat oh my gosh is it a long car ride if it is who cares okay we ll have so much fun together i was also thinking like do i keep you blindfolded for the entire time oh my gosh because you might get sick and it s just you and i right don t throw in a loop de doop no it s just you and i okay i don t like that many people so honestly shane was like i don t want to come you invited him of course i invited him and if he doesn t well he doesn t want to go to any like he doesn t no this is definitely not his bag i knew for a fact this was not his bag all right but i you know he s your husband so uh so what what s going on with chris lizzie was like chris has a huge big story for all of us oh yeah chris has a tale to tell oh how was your weekend chris it was interesting why was it interesting i think you need to treat chris with the upmost respect this week i am i literally said chris has something to say okay i m advocating for our boy here well i was just telling lizzy a story uh that happened a day or two ago where um we were out at an event uh selling selling barbecue and then a whole thing ended up happening where the person refused to pay us so basically what happened they were hired to come sell barbecue at this event they were leaving and they re like all right where s our money like pay us and the guy goes he he says well he keeps giving us the run around he keeps like saying oh in a minute i m waiting on transfer all this all that and then he ends up like trying to leave but he can t find his keys and at one point someone s like oh there s someone with a gun outside the event and that turns out the person with a gun outside the event was also trying to get their money from this guy and was owed a lot of money and wasn t getting it so their friend who was very mad showed up with a gun to get their money and then they were kicked out we found this out much later on though but uh and we were trying to get our money so the people that were eating the barbecue were eating for free because somebody had paid you guys yeah there was a package thing like a vip their section and if you re in the vip section you didn t have to pay up front because we were getting like a a lump sum like a agreed upon amount of money yeah uh as long as we covered so many people or whatever up to so many people and uh and we did we covered all the people we agreed on and did you get paid no uh and he stays up all night making this meet wait and yeah yeah so much work into this his friend was like this is insane and we were like we got ta get paid so we like confronted the guy yeah and uh and he he ended up calling the police because we re standing there talking we re like upset we re like guys like we don t want issues we just want the money like we worked so hard and then like we straight up see a light shine down from the sky from the heavens and it s like this helicopter and a police presence i feel like i m in grand theft auto like cops show up and they re like what s going on yeah because somebody had said they brought a gun so yeah the dude called the police and said we re holding him at gunpoint like threatening his life for money and we re saying we re going to take him to a hotel room and stuff it was a whole insane thing i told you chris had a story oh my god talk about some hot guys we should have put a camera on him i didn t i know i was thinking that the whole time i didn t know how to i was panicking with the decorations i really floundered on that element there s a few things going on today stupid but you know now he s out like a lot of like he put a lot of money into that man but so then the cops just said like what what was their decisions the cops actually really ended up being really nice and really on our side they were like oh we can very much see that you were screwed over and this sucks but like there s absolutely nothing legally we can do about it because you didn t have a contract or something like a written agreement you didn t have a contract just texts and i mean technically an oral agreement is binding in california and you can take this A A to small claims court i think we have to but he s from arizona i don t think we re going to see him again oh wow yeah gosh so you re out the money of the meat the whole day but all the labor yes but the story think of the story riley well only we re benefiting from the story as entertainment for everyone else but he did it to everyone like there s many many people we found out wow and that s how you run an event that s how you do it ladies how does he but if he s from arizona why is he throwing an event how does he even know enough people here well he just finds strangers that don t know he s a scammer like chris and and then he travels all his friends he s like this look this city doesn t know i m a scammer yet everyone pile into what baker s skills we re going to bakersfield oh my gosh like he didn t even have the event space people just showed up and the city was like i guess we forgot about this yo should we host an event yeah he got a lot of money oh wow oh my gosh how much did you spend on the barbecue like a grand more oh more like three probably plus like their what their time i mean plus what they would have made yeah but they just love doing it this is his livelihood i m joking i m joking wow that s a A A nightmare i m sorry i m sweating too so i finally stopped barfing you did yeah hell yeah well actually no my barf session really only lasted so immediately after last week s podcast uh like an hour later i barfed more than i ve ever barfed in my entire life it s just like but you looked so good couldn t stop yeah something to see a photo and she s like honestly you ve never looked hotter in your life but then so i was only violently sick that night i woke up the next day still unwell and the problem with like a stomach bug is you can t eat and then you also can t consume the caffeine that i m addicted to then you get a freaking crazy migraine so i have a migraine and i can t move because it s your stomach so like every time you move but then magically at noon the next day i like was almost better out of nowhere so i thought i came to the conclusion it must have just been something i had eaten yeah but then i mean you also had a fever did i because when i asked you if you had a fever you said no i m literally freezing and being freezing in like a normal temperature environment means you have a fever the chills are an indication of a fever oh because i was like touching my head i m like i don t know i can t you wouldn t know because your whole body s burning up and if you re so cold you have a A A fever i asked shane and he didn t know either so here we are but then i woke up and i had a huge like the biggest crater on my forehead i had ever had in my life and i thought wow what a week for me to be alive but days later it never went away and it it was like a big pussed up thing like the circumference of it was huge and i was facetiming with my mom and she goes oh no that s a spider bite and then i went closer and you could see like two prongs which like you had a A A spider bite okay i m allegedly or it could be a mosquito who knows why are you like defending the spider well listen then cause shane didn t get what i had gotten like he he also had like diarrhea but it wasn t that s normal yeah like that s lizzie s all day i identify and so i was like oh we re fine but then my mom goes oh it could have been the spider and i looked it up and black widows if they bite you all of the same symptoms of a stomach bug can happen from a spider bite dude and chris had seen that juicy A A spider up in this A A and then five days later shane had gotten what i got like friday i had this money did you search his body for spider man and then friday he got it so now i m thinking either what i got was a stomach bug and i m so sorry right but i never got it and i literally felt your breath crossed my lips so do you think only because shane and i have sex maybe but no it happened for five days like that s a long period of increasing that s a gestation period i would have had to have it did you search his body for bites no but then i was thinking i m gon na pry those butt cheeks apart and look for bites what if there s a black widow living in our bed no there s for sure a black widow living in your bed you live on a A A black widow nest and now i m just spiraling in what s it called rattlesnake country what it could be and i keep thinking now are we just going to keep giving it back and forth to each other is it never going to end no it ll end and you guys will leave the spiders because you re going back to colorado yeah where there s no spiders yeah no spiders not a single spider in colorado no no not at all safe space but i m better i don t think there s obviously worse things in a stomach bug but like in terms of common colds a stomach bug is oh it s not cool the last time i had a stomach bug and was vomiting i called my mom at two o clock in the morning because i was like i m A A dying it s like i m a year old woman calling my mom crying me too and there s nothing you can do like and nobody can help you like shane s like how can i help i m like you can t because i can t even move i can t even sit here without being in physical pain so it was an awful hours but here we are to live another day not to be sick but i also love the attention of a stomach bag when i was little my god mom used to just set up newspapers around the bed and just let me like dramatically puke wherever i want it that s love let s see i made sure to make it to the toilet and then shane for some reason when he was throwing up he took the the garbage was kind of full so he took the bag out and threw up in the trash can love him so much i ll do anything for him but i was like oh now you got to clean this up in the bag and then i m like hauling the trash can outside hosing it and lysoline it out i m like good thing we re getting two details we re getting two details here sorry if you re eating your lunch with us oh no like i mean i m not eating my lunch with you and i m sick we both started our birthday weeks off hard oh yeah we did you know yeah we did i broke my neck getting old is not easy no it s very hard so you know respect your elders because they re going through some A A yeah and i m for sure i think i m going to be so yeah that s me what do you mean you think well i need to verify i need to like count back the years to make sure are you joking no kind of like sometimes doesn t it take you a second to remember how old you are and then if i really start thinking about age i get real A A up in the head because i m like well time flies yeah i m going to be so soon so soon so soon um no i never forget my age because i m a narcissist and i literally uh equate all points of other people s lives to my own personal age at that time you know though you re really in line with the rest of america because yes your score seemed high but it was only like a point higher than the average person that took the test we all know i A A lied because we did it on air just kidding i m just kidding okay do you want to talk about something serious or do you want to talk about your beef with kylie s met gala vlog did you see it did you see kylie s there s so much more going on with kylie besides this met gala vlog which is like her nothing at all well her and travis are like public on instagram again like lovey dovey and A A well yeah she just had to wait a beat no they were broken up were they yes they were broken up in regards to what into a romantic relationship they were done so right prior to uh what the tragedy that had happened with travis no like well before that they had separated they had a magazine come out like during that time where they were like flaunting their love together not really okay i mean i heard there was some speculation of people that were on that set that the two of them didn t even speak to each other while they were doing it so they re gon na sell their love and hate each other i don t think they were selling their love i think they were modeling honestly i don t think that was about their love affair i think they were modeling it was i could be wrong it was them with their child yeah because they re they re great co parents and they love stormy and they love being parents together but i don t think they were together at that time as a romantic entity and i don t think they were romantic when the baby formerly known as wolf was okay so okay we don t anyways they re back maybe yeah um they re working it out on a a night vacation rental so you look at the price it came i think instagram just knows me so well because they they fed that to me it was like an icon you know what they do with the houses on history it s like the mansion and then like a cut out of the two of them and it said it runs to grand tonight full service like the whole gamut should we go yeah well let s get right on it let s write it off i m sure the hundred thousand dollars they paid in their private jet costs to get there so i ll fly coach i m not opposed to that okay so what s the actual story did you see the A A met gala vlog did either of you see it uh uh yes i skimmed through it so not much happens i tried skimming a lot of them yeah i mean the difference is kylie jenners was produced for her channel it wasn t like a vogue video and a lot of these celebrities they re doing that it s a nine minute video and there s minutes of credits yes obb like what the A A what s obb so it s well that s why there s what does lbb stand for like oh shoot i don t know what it stands for what is it about chris can look it up for us um well they re just a production company this i think his name is daniel ratner but he s he somehow got in bed with all of these youtubers and i think it started with youtube originals when they were doing like the docu series with demi lovato and justin bieber he was the production company that did that and from there he got onto producing haley bieber s youtube channel i mean haley bieber does A A on her channel this kylie video like she gave as much in her no haley talks on her show and she has little A A bits and she s like cooking in her bathroom and making mac and cheese and being silly well same production company he does all these i m saying there s something to produce there s something to produce there they have camera angles they have a concept they have a show well what are you expecting kylie doesn t even give anything on the actual kardashians it s like no i know but it s just like this is your own channel girly what chris obb stands for original big bold founded in by michael d ratner oh not daniel ratner michael isn t daniel ratner like a bad person look up dan ratner he s a not he s not even a person i m so stupid i just ruined dan rotner s life but a lot of these yeah i mean a lot of them have there was very few of the met gala videos that like the celebrity was serving anything yeah except for the kravis one i didn t see that i sent you the tick tock of courtney and travis oh courtney s wearing like everyone s like what the A A is this like at the met gala courtney s like oh i didn t this isn t on theme like i just does it look on theme and it s just like in there is it that was a vogue one right in their vogue youtube get ready with me travis was like at first like i didn t get it i m like shouldn t i look a little A A up too and then i like realized you re like oh like no courtney looks A A up and i don t it s like a boom a light went on he literally said like okay what did you find the only thing that came up for dan ratner was a doctor dan ratner what s he do what kind of an experienced psychologist and podcaster specializing in the treatment of chronic pain and tms patients oh my god that s me get dan on the phone as we age we need this man it s a podcast guys dan help help uh sydney sweeney s which we didn t see her look when we were recording the episode i thought was fabulous but she actually did give lightly because she was so excited to go and she really did they you got to see the whole journey with her and she was facetiming everyone so i thought hers was the best of the ones that i consider so that s that um somebody was over here the other day and i kept walking outside like we were in and out of the house uh the guy that helps me uh make uh fixes to that changes to the house and we kept walking in and out of the house and i kept sneezing every time i would encounter the sun and he s like what what what is that and i was like you re like it s a psychological issue that i suffer from well i was like no it s a sun sneeze you don t sun sneeze like you never walk into the sun and sneeze and he s like never in my entire life but people in the comment sections have i know and that s why i thought because i thought i thought you were crazy too i i thought we d put this conversation to bed yes but it turns out like i thought we did just agreed upon that it s it s a rational thing to have happen i mean it s i wouldn t say the word is rational i just don t know like it s uh it happens to more than just you it s innate in my body when i go outside to look towards the sun and sneeze and looking at the sun it s not like a most people don t look directly at the sun it s not like a swallowing air to burp it s like it forces an authentic sneeze the sensation of sneezing when you see the sun is called photic sneeze reflex so you ve got a photic sneeze reflex it means light so it literally means that the reflex that makes the light causes a sneeze some scientists have given it another name so shane and i both have this so that s why i think it s weird when somebody doesn t have it and it s i don t have it it s the most satisfying thing ever like i love it so much i used to take a back massager and put it to my nose to make myself sneeze see so this article says ten to thirty percent of people have it so not a lot of people no you re special also google how close a sneeze is to an orgasm chris okay i bet it s similar to like the sensation of peeing when you have to pee real bad they say that s like a fraction of an organism oh my god i held my peace up this is so boring i held my pee so long the other day that i got stomach cramps to the point of which i couldn t move without screaming and i was like oh my god i finally did i m like rowing euphoria like this is depression this is real and then i just keep trying to remind myself like you re not depressed you re just sad there s a difference i was gon na ask why you re sad but we don t need to get into it not unless you want to you re like i d be sad too your life i figured it out well i know no i know it s just funny the way that it played out okay

the sneeze orgasm thing but this one doctor basically said that there s no similarity oh this is what this one doctor said then why do i come a little bit every time why does it make me so wet why do i walk outside to A A sneeze all right well speaking of sex um so i mean i personally would feel remiss if we didn t touch upon us the topic of the leak of the roe v wade decision in the supreme court and uh you know more than anything i like i kind of feel a little bit nervous talking about it because it s such a hot button issue and my whole philosophy and one of the reasons why i i love america so much because i really do i love this A A country right um is liberty it s our liberties my liberty does not extend to your body your liberty does not extend to my body and that s what i think is so important and valuable about our country and the initial you know value behind the bill of rights and the constitution to protect those liberties yeah and even though when the constitution was written you know not every single person in america enjoyed the same liberties we ve fought for centuries for those civil liberties to be extended to everybody right and i think not only is a woman s right to choose something that should be protected but also other people s right to not elect to have this procedure done should also be protected you know what i m saying like i just don t think it s anyone s business to be making decisions for anyone exactly their own life so the way that they choose to live their lives and i think it s deeply personal for everyone no matter what decision they re making but to just throw it down on that anyone and you know another thing i d like to say is if you re so passionate about protecting the life of an unborn child i think that there are other ways to protect that life besides taking over or diminishing another person s bodily autonomy and liberty and that comes with sexual education you know uh making contraceptive more readily available there are so many A A things that you can do to help protect the life of an unborn child before stripping a woman of her right to choose there are so many A A things you can do and i really i i you know i have friends who are pro life and i for not one second i m ever going to try to convince you otherwise that that is your right to feel that way and i m also never like in this in the same way i wish that that could come hand in hand with a woman who has to make the super A A hard choice to choose to have an abortion yeah because that s nobody A A skips into an abortion and it s it s hard because half of the population aren t women so like it s hard for yeah and they re they re men who have benefited from an abortion more women have had abortions than than ever publicized because even in the stigma of having one is so strong that a woman walks out of it with so much A A shame that she can t share it with other people and it s you know it just it breaks my heart it s not something that anybody does like comfortably or joyously it s a A A devastating affair for everyone involved it s a hard A A choice to make the bottom line is our country has tried prohibition abortion was illegal women still got abortions just more women died because of the back alley abortions that they were getting because they were not sick which and that s that should be the end all be all is it s not if somebody it is set on that is the best choice for the position they re at they re not going to not do it so it s only going to make things just more dangerous more difficult and more scary and here s where i think that party politics really plays like a nasty A A hand it s like you know the same is true about all prohibition and always has been this is an experiment we ve tried over and over we tried to prohibit alcohol people kept drinking yeah you know what i mean people found a way to drink drugs are illegal how many A A drug addicts are on the streets these days we and when we like uh to the same degree that it s like you know i m not big on guns in fact i m A A scared of guns i m so afraid of a gun that i can t even hold a gun in a shooting range without having a A A panic attack right i don t like them but here s the deal the second we make guns illegal the only people who are going to have guns are people who don t mind breaking the A A law and that s that s where it becomes like such a A A frustrating thing because in and just to bring it full circle back to my whole thing of like i love this country because i love liberty we need to stop dictating what is and what isn t for every person and just respect the core value of our country which is that my liberty doesn t move past my body and yours doesn t move past yours and i think that should be that is everyone should be able to make the best informed decision for themselves and i shouldn t like i i m not mad about how either of you choose to live your life in any regard so why should i choose if you are pregnant or not yes it s just not my business no it s just not my business and it s easy to say that in california where guaranteed i m not going to lose my right to choose yeah but it s yeah and it s very upsetting and then oh the last thing sorry i like wrote something because i m very nervous talking about this publicly but i just want to say like if you re not happy with the america you re living in you live in an america where you can be the change you want to see in this country i think it is so A A that people just say i m exiting the country make it better make it s like what jfk is to say ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country be the change you want to see in the world yeah and you can do it you know people it s like it s not unheard of to do it s been done so go A A get them like and i feel you know i just don t i mean i don t know enough about like about everything that s going on i can t like why the leak why the leak is very concerning it s a sus ass time for a leak like this and it s so frustrating and hard to get lit up about something that s not like an official thing yet but it s like and that s so did somebody leak it in hopes that the reaction would cause it s suspiciously close to midterm elections but leaking uh leaking a supreme court ruling is not going to change the supreme court ruling like that s why that the the court is established the way that it is that it s not that they re ruled by the country majority opinion but ruled by what they believe the constitution means for its people s rights um wait a second do we just jump into some iced tea should we talk about how ryan reynolds was on the masked singer in korea because what the A A that s the only way it s the only way to segue right ryan reynolds did the math singer in A A korea so that we could segue out of this topic and what does that even mean did you see the tick tock i sent you yeah i mean i was so bored dude s got pipes i watch for two and a half seconds that s all you need i it wasn t for me but i just thought why is he doing this and why so he did it for us to segue out of a hot dog but like what s going on uh is he there for a movie or what like what did he fly to south korea to beyond the mass singer you got no other context no i just loved it i just loved it like how do you know it wasn t the american did you hear that voice oh of course that s not the american one well you re to get his copy written Music you re going to get us copy written no there s no way there s a very big way for that that long of a tick tock yeah of the sun will come out tomorrow of course yeah in korean sung by ryan reynolds it s not in korean well it was in korea i just need some context like why was it that s why it s so epic there is no A A context bro that s why it s everything to me wow that s like the sim gods being like you know what you ve been having a hard time your government trying to get in your reproductive rights here enjoy some ryan reynolds doing some math singer oh man oh man a man but yeah that s literally all i had on that Laughter all right did you want to go into where do you want to go next well we could just take it back from the top you had dave chappelle is this old news oh yeah but it s iced tea that s all we do here but i was re watched so dave chappelle was participating in the netflix isn t funny it s a joke oh netflix is a joke the netflix is parallel to humor but in the opposite direction which would be non so right i don t know anyways he was in the netflix as a joke special and he s standing on stage and he starts his thing and some A A guy jumps up on stage and A A rushes him and apparently the guy had a fake gun with a blade attached to the tip of it and um the dude got his A A rocked as he should i mean there s no and i there i didn t see personally any backlash for his team or security acting in such a manner that really did mess up that guy here s what i m wondering because i know that security did help out but i ve also heard that chappelle rolls with like of his friends just like a mob of his homies and i saw some video of a big group of people surrounding this guy who were just like chappelle s dudes molly whopping him i mean after what had happened and to be performing in cro i don t even like going to concerts or festivals for the fear of oh it s all could happen and being the performer in a crowd of hundreds if not thousands it s just so scary yeah that and having something like this happen i honestly don t know how artists performers and comedians feel comfortable moving forward at all in a way that i mean unless there s the utmost security at the door yeah bodyguards surrounding the A A swat team in front of the stage like it s mind blowing and it s sad that we ve come to a place where it has to be this scary to go to a live event do you remember when live events like all they had to worry about was someone deciding to get naked and run across the stage which how incredible like can we go back to streaking like can we just take it back or like maybe i m nostalgic or homesick for another era but why can t we just be like naked running across stage at a live event why can t we do that could try it let s try it it was so much more enjoyable and quite frankly no one left a streaking moment with the A A bump that that dude had on his head or his arm contorted in such a way like are we really trying to play those games y all if you don t like a comedian just get naked and run across the stage and preferably not even on the stage no i mean that s at least kind of funny let s start like making like passive statements that are like you know a little bit more intriguing you know if you re and if you re naked you re less of a threat like if you re naked with visibly nothing in the hands i don t think the security guards are gon na tackle you or take you all the way down they ll probably just push you off the stage see that s what you think but then also like have you seen eastern promises no there s a A A knife fight in a bath in a locker room where everyone s naked as A A because i always thought that too it s like oh no you get naked you re crazy no one s touching you but it s like if a dude wants to get violent he don t give a A A like he ll strip down too but i m saying if you re the performer right i m performing i m more comfortable if a naked guy s storming the stage because i can visibly see there s nothing in his hands coming at me and the fly in this room is driving me bonkers i know it s like it s so rude that there would be a fly right now like of all time and he will not stop it there s a time and a place fly this is our streaker we got a fly streaker god nobody s safe even in an audience free podcast we re getting A A stage jived what is it called just rushed what else are we doing here oh khloe kardashian reacts to tristan thompson s reconciliation on the hulu show and see i was ahead of my time i knew that she must have been feeling something reliving watching him try to finesse his way back into her life and so now she s tweeting about watching these scenes where she s trying to make it work with him and i this is just gon na cause a fight between us but he literally tweeted when all like in real time not now that the show s going but you don t deserve the heartache and humiliation that i have caused you and the opposite end of humiliation in my mind is embarrassment and so i m not that s the same thing it s not the opposite end humiliation oh that s what i mean but you were saying chloe shouldn t be embarrassed i agree no i m saying sure is embarrassed but i want society to flip the switch on that A A and make tristan thompson mortified for being the A A that he is as he should be right correct yeah we re saying the same thing but you fought with me for no i know that she s embarrassed that i m saying she should not be okay Laughter so glad you felt the need to bring that up you were the one that you re lucky it s your birthday you put it it s your birthday what did you think putting it on the documentary girl you put the tristan quote on the documentary because you put this link and i m gon na get naked and A A rush your stage right now i m looking through the link and i m like there s nothing happening except for chloe acting in the way i would act had i let a A A boy back into my life although i understand why she did she has a child with the man i would have done the same thing yeah chrishell s house is out in these streets while in out with a new lover g flip never heard of her before this this is great publicity for g flip g flip is that they them oh did i say otherwise yeah but it s okay i m sorry i i didn t know that there are they them right because i watched the selling sunset reunion and it s just a complete from anything i was uh expecting from krishele s future right like a year old because she was all or nothing with jason you re either going to have a child with me or there s no free fun dating so they broke up because of that and now she s dating g flip who is a rock star traveling the world living best life and it s nothing but casual so maybe it s just her rebound maybe she s christelle has um just turned a new leaf in that or maybe michelle s pregnant with herself like you know no i m just kidding i got ta stop doing that i keep saying people are pregnant on this podcast like i know anything i don t i m sorry that s real i was literally maya i don t think you watched the reunion yet i did i watched it a little bit while i was making my chili yesterday i was maya when i found out did you see maya s reaction no because i would like i m listening to it like in chopping krishel s talking about how she s dating chi flip and maya s just like Laughter and then they re showing photos and she gets a fake i don t know it s just like the biggest plot twist of all time to me like who could have seen it coming i actually learned a lot on tick tock i didn t know krishna was dating mr shuster from glee and then he supposedly cheated on her with leah michelle like christelle has a A A hard dark seated dating history yeah i guess so i didn t know the glee thing either yeah and then but this is a star and a bat a guy who was on the bachelorette and she dated one of her dancing with the star i think she s just out here trying to navigate her way through life like like i m not shaming anyone for dating i think you should date as much as you want in my s i dated a lot just people weren t following my life right um and i just didn t expect this one yeah it s a shocking turn of events but also go go ahead say what you re gon na say they re out here making out at the abbey in west hollywood crochet s tattooing their leg yeah christelle tattooed their leg and that s what i mean it s just wow it s like didn t courtney do that to travis i don t know well that s an indication of a real serious A A situation see i don t know if it is though especially yeah like the pete davidsons of the world he got branded to prove a point but was it proving a point or does he just tattoo everything that happens in his life yeah it s not at this point it s like did you see that tick tock of kim telling him to take off his double hat no there s a tick tock going around of her at the ripley s believe it or not where everyone s like this is so cute like dave s wearing two A A hats and kim s like take your two A A hats off so that this doesn t embarrass mommy and i m just like she s talking to him like a child why are we all pretending like this relationship seems super chill and great because if anybody spoke to me in the tone that she s talking to him it s just like how about the fact did you read the article that came out with ray j this week no what talking about how the sec the original sex tape was a deal between oh like chris and vivid and vivid with rj or rj ray j and that it had been calculated from the very beginning and he said i played along to go along because it was what i had agreed to do but now that it s the forefront again of this and tarnishing my name incredible i m not gon na just sit back and watch as this happens and he actually released some of his dms with kim uh with one of these outlets and kim s not denying it she s just saying like i ll make sure to set the record straight and say that you weren t actively out again i don t have the exact quotes in front of me but kim s not denying it she s just like trying to make ray j not mad while still navigating her throw line hmm so there s that there is that i mean i think half the world already thought it was a fabricated thing you know yeah i mean i just don t care me either yeah i feel like everybody A A cares about this A A and i just like i just don t well if i was rayjay i think i would care if i was ray j i would care and like the i do think this is kind of funny though but there s like a late night interview where courtney and kim are there and someone brings up the tape i don t remember who the host was at the time but courtney s like if she was gon na do it for publicity she would have done it with someone who s famous which is such a sick burn but they both i mean i don t know if either of them were super famous no one was super famous at the time and the reason i feel okay talking about it on the podcast is because they make it the center line of this new season yeah i mean this is something yeah they have creative control they knew that the cameras were rolling when they were talking about this knowing the world was going to talk about this knowing they were putting it in the premiere episode to get the world talking about it so i just don t feel bad commentating on it no not even a little bit no okay you added this one i have no idea what s going on i mean we can skip it it s the least interesting one okay a few rapid fire before we get to advice though because we do have to do advice though today okay big news jojo and kylie are back together love wins people i never know which x is which it s her only x no there were there was a string of three different girls at some point this is the only x that s ever A A mattered in the fandom are you sure yeah and they re back like officially yeah they re back like posted on instagram A A married matching tattoos they re both pregnant like this is the most official relationship that s ever been oh my god none of what i just said is true all as well but they are back they are back they re at A A disneyland jojo s like if you set it free and love comes back it s a boomerang no i made that up too i m shook oh my gosh i m out of control take this platform away from me i can t stand it anymore i m holding it like the power is too much for one little ginger to hold and the world the world s a good place for jojo siwa i think she s about to be a judge on dancing with the stars i don t think that s paired yet right no she s like becoming really mainstream hollywood not dancing with the stars so you think you can dance yes dance dance is it so you think you can dance u s or is it like a foreign sick good for her um uh then i wanted to talk about really quickly the tick tock chella cram vestas okay oh man but i don t i don t know well enough to like appropriately plug it but basically there s this girl right she s that coachella this guy s like hey mom let me talk to you and she s like i don t want to talk he s like i ma make her talk to me robs her steals her A A purse steals or steals out of her purse her cell phone her credit cards her the keys to her rental car and like she literally is A A because of all the A A that he took from her she gets in a uber ride the uber driver s like what s up girl like what happened his name is raul i don t remember her name and um Music she s like yo this guy A A robbed me the two of them get together they get coffee they get margaritas they start piecing the A A together they figure the guy s name out they find his airbnb they call the A A cops they storm his place to get her A A back they don t find the A A the cops are like sorry we can t really help you but she and raul she figures out our raul shares with her that his daughter has A A cancer his dad has A A cancer they re both in this like they re both seeking treatment for right now which is wildly expensive he s from fresno and drove all the way down to coachella to make extra money to steal things no this is the uber driver the it doesn t matter forget about everything about that rancid man that stole from her now we re talking about raul and his family struggles okay anyways this young woman starts to go fund me to help pay for his daughter s cancer treatment because he drove from fresno to coachella to make extra money to afford it because it s expensive um as a mother of a french bulldog with cancer i can also say that A A is A A expensive and uh she raised over a hundred thousand dollars to help him with his father and his daughter s cancer treatment unfortunately his father has since passed away so some of that is going to pay for his funeral service but i thought that this would be you know a good time to plug that gofundme because yeah i believe the gofundme is still alive and the daughter is still needing treatment it s ongoing and you know it would be a huge blessing i think for a great man to contribute to that yeah and i ll donate today as well we ll leave the link in the description section below of the audio and the video for the youtube but yeah i just thought that was A A epic that was everything and i also wanted to know what what s that no you said tv reviews did you are you watching staircase no i m so behind because i haven t watched the documentary don t first this is don t it s much more engaging if you don t know what s coming well i mean i i know that the person gets pushed down a staircase yeah it s much more engaging if you don t know what s coming do not watch the documentary but is the show good is the show better than the documentary because i ve heard a lot of like the amount of my friends in real life that have told me that the netflix documentary is just jaw droppingly amazing yeah i don t know is the series gon na own or live up i put the show on to fall asleep to and wound up up until a m watching all three episodes could not fall asleep to it see i begged shane to watch it with me the other night and he was like ugh i know the story exactly but you don t know the story and i m telling you it s a lot more A A insane than you know okay i ll watch that first i m excited yeah it s definitely worth watching and then are you watching we crash of course i am here s the thing i finally of course i am well i well no it s been months like it s been oh you A A with anne hathaway gosh but that s why you re watching it love anne hathaway and so the trailer was bad like i m just gon na flat out say the trailer was bad and that s why it took me so long to get here but now here we are and oh am i enjoying the ride i love it but i also don t know the we crash story i know there s been a documentary but which i heard was a snooze fest i heard that too and if you already know the story it might not be as enticing but i just feel like it s i don t know if it s a dropout level but it has that same sort of intrigue because i didn t know the whole theranos story leading up to like i knew some headlines but i just think it s really fun i think jared leto s really good in it speaking of um no we re not going to talk about that okay Laughter we admitted too many faults already we there are some things that we re just never going to have to talk about because it s like duh we know we get it that wasn t jared leto but to be fair the publication we took it from had also thought it was jared leto which everybody A A thought it was jared leto wow which is so funny because i was then seeing jared leto in like this twinning outfit at the met gala and i was like that dude had two crazy looks how did he change into that so fast cool okay well never thought i could have been wrong though no never

because it s sandwiched between both of our birthdays we got a birthday inquiry for advice though so i thought it was fitting for the timing do you want to read them uh sure i only say it like that because i don t have my glasses on so i can t know i got this i just need to follow along with my finger and really focus pray for her and i ll pray for you and you ll pray for me and chris is praying too sorry when the caffeine hey i m not sure if it s too late to email this but i wanted to talk about my own situation slash get advice on it okay so my birthday was on monday may st and my husband completely dropped the ball on it he didn t plan anything nor did he have the kids do anything plan anything i went to work i got home and everyone was asleep he says i m overreaching but i think i m not what do you think also a week before my birthday i saw that his boss had texted him what i thought was suggestions on what to get me but now that my birthday passed and i didn t get anything i realized there might be something else there i don t know what do you what to do or feel any takes first of all yeah that blows ass like i ve had everyone forget my birthday but my husband didn t well and that was during coronavirus like yeah we were so scared to be fair like a lot of the i mean like i don t want to sound awful like i ve let it go but like i was on a few group tracks and i was like about to be like it s my birthday like literally texting it and someone was like my aunt just died of covid and i was like well we re gon na let this year go uh we re gon na let this year go uh but this year still my husband celebrated my birthday oh and if you guys were just dating and had no kids i would say leave the man Laughter i mean so here s the sus ass thing like you re saying a week before my birthday i saw that his boss had texted him so where did you see this text are you going through your husband s phone do you feel compelled to go do you feel compelled to go through his phone on a regular basis is there a bigger trust issue or was the ipad just open and you happened to be playing candy crush come down yeah like i want to know what s going on there because if you don t trust this dude and also what a A A weird ass thing to talk to your husband about buying your mistress or to talk to your boss about buying your mistress a birthday gift i just feel like confront this A A on all A A fronts yeah and i i think what you said overreaching but i think uh you meant overreact your husband thought you re you re overreacting and being sad i think if i came home uh to no birthday acknowledgement and the family was asleep after i had been working i d scream cry yeah i would be upset too i think if he thinks you re overreacting the best way to go about it is to approach him in a way that doesn t feel like you re attacking him rather showing him i get that s what you want to do that s what i would want to do obviously he s not responding right so maybe you need to react bigger no maybe you need to set this A A house on fire have you tried setting the house on fire yet because you could set the house on fire i would just explain to him though how much it hurts your feelings and if he is still not taking i mean because it doesn t even take something huge i m not a big birthday person either but i want to feel like somebody had thought about me like i want shane to get me a card if not anything and wake up and say like happy birthday i love you so much um and that doesn t take much effort or money to do something like that and so that s probably where he s missing the A A was six dollars on amazon and if he doesn t yes i mean it came in hours look at this and if he s not taking that to heart then you set the house on fire yeah yeah um but i think having a frank discussion with him explaining i saw this conversation it stressed me out you blew me off on my birthday that A A hurt what is up because my all my intuition is tingling and none of it is in a good way yeah and yeah even more so we don t have enough information on the text to his boss but i think that s something you definitely need to get to the bottom two of because you can t just be hanging on in a relationship that you re uh suspicious and the gap s growing between you guys because of it you need to address it you need to address it you want to read this next one yeah um hi there i need advice on my current situation my kids and i separated seven my kids dad let me see oh happy birthday to you cha cha cha happy birthday to you happy birthday dear island happy birthday to you gotcha you really did get me i literally didn t see it coming chris turned off the light and i was like what is going on this is the cutest cake ever oh my gosh i love it happy birthday thank you so much and the only reason i looked up is because i didn t know if i was reading the right advice or not well that s why i had you read the next one so you d be distracted reading let s see the cake i love it so much look at how cute this is thank you guys you re welcome i love this birthday celebration oh how sad that this literally came after that advice though oh this is what you deserve girl A A get you a man who does this A A you know what we need to send you a cake we re sending her a cake reply with your email or reply to that message with your address please yeah um let me see which other one i wanted to do hi i m and have been newly engaged oh i remember this i have been newly engaged to the man i met six years ago we have a house and a little fur family we are close to each other s families and are planning our wedding for this upcoming winter on the surface it looks like we have everything figured out but i feel like i m making the biggest mistake of my life i don t think i truly love this man like i have loved others in the past intimacy is zero out of ten after dozens of conversations on how to fix things or what the other person needs and i feel like he prioritizes trivial things over quality time i m not the type of girl who needs attention but it d be nice to at least two to three times a week i find myself thinking about my past relationships or situationships and constantly thinking i made the wrong choice i love that we have i love what we have built but i really uh can i really throw my happiness out for comfort tell me if i m an awful person thanks this might be the worst position to be in yeah i mean it s also like how close are you to your wedding do you need to step away and figure out whether or not this is truly a situation where you are unhappy with this man or do you have cold feet yes you know what i mean yeah and is the somewhat mundane life that you re living uh actually wonderful you re just afraid or reflecting on like the death of single life yeah flings that were romanticized in the past i think before anything you really need to sit and meditate on what you have in front of you and how devastated you would be if you lost your partner altogether because i can t i m in this position like i m really close to i m not in the position that i m not in love with shane but i m saying if i wasn t in love with shane like we have like animals together our families are close we re intertwined we live together so if i didn t think that he was my person i would be sick to my stomach throwing up at all times because i just like it would be awful to have built something for six years with somebody and know that i needed to make an escape yeah i also think love has seasons and like the longer you re with someone you realize the variation between each season so it s like you know there s a honeymoon phase to every everything like not just relationships everything and uh you know passion ebbs and flows but it also like it comes back it always comes back yeah and marriage is a lifelong choice it s like a it s a binding contract to say that we re going to stay together stick with each other through the times that maybe aren t as passionate in in life so i think you just have to ask yourself if he s your best friend if you re uh stimulated mentally with him and if you enjoy uh what you have together yeah i also think that sexual attraction uh is real you know what i mean like i think that that s a chemical thing that you can t control but i also believe that sometimes depending on your age and you know your physical health your sexual libido or whatever can also be complicated or diminished yeah so if he s not a hundred percent well that could also be a reason why he s not sexually you know coming at you yeah i would think remember back to why you got this far in the relationship with him and really make a pros and cons list because i m not saying to stay in a relationship that you re not fulfilled in because i don t think you ll be your best you or live a good life if truly the choices that you need to leave him but i would really make a pros and cons list in your head and try to make the best decision you can because and be honest with him and be kind to him be honest with him and be kind to him and be kind to yourself i wish you the best and um we re about to run out of space on our memory card but thank you so much for joining this birthday edition of the sip thank you guys so much this is everything and i can t wait to go eat my cake uh oh you don t get to eat the cake if you guys want to follow us on social media we re at the sip official we re also on there personally we love you so much thanks for watching and supporting our show we ll see you next week the goodbye i m still recovering okay all right i m gon na take this cake and go Music you
Music so Music i m taking a titty pick for my husband really putting those together excited to see you later you know uh while we re getting ready for this show good oh yeah what s your infatuation with tits today oh i just have acne on my chest not your own i m saying you commented on two different breasts bosoms no i haven t on my own and that ladies are at the restaurant and then you showed me another example right i have talked about three sets of tits one of which being my own um i m not sending that to joe later i m also texting with my dad right now and i don t want to get those lines crossed she had like five series of events about her appearance right before we started rolling she goes i m wearing the kind of thing that you would make fun of and i said meat that i make fun of and she goes no that i make fun of and then two seconds later like a completely different person wow i m so hot i am so like those two can be the same like no matter what you re wearing look at me though i m wearing leggings A A workout shoes and a mini dress that i m going to take off the second we re done rolling because you can t see my bottom half but it s wack well we re filming two in a day because lizzy flew out to colorado two film podcasts which you re rallying strong honestly i commend you i m dying i don t know how you can do two a days in that airport oh uh it s because i like really want to go home like it s it s weird it s like a weird thing like i always love coming here and every time i m here i m like god i want to stay longer but then like in the back of my head it s like i miss my A A dogs and i do miss joe i get that i mean well not i m not missing joe specifically like i like joe but i m not like you know he s not my significant other but the puppy thing like i even go to my parents house for an hour i m like i got ta get home to her hailey because it s just like this bond where she does so many cute things and it s like i don t want to miss any of it and i just want to be with her at all times it s just like whenever i m not home i come home and it s like there s more destruction done to the cabinet in the kitchen where the puppy s been gnawing on it because i know they leave him in the kitchen with the gate locked or he s been eating the window in the front of the house so the window is just slowly eroding and yesterday joe had the audacity to like walk by the window that s like been the same amount of eaten since i ve gotten home because i m the only one who has like the dog on the couch with me all the time and joe goes wow that s gotten so much bigger today and it s like today you mean while i was out of town interesting choice of words they can t be trusted alone with animals loki they can not significant others in general no i can trust them they re just i can trust them oh no i m just saying for both of us like even i left today and it goes both ways like i can be equally as forgetful but i we were running out to lunch and i said oh we ve been doing riley s training sessions at lunch so instead of lunch he gets his food with his training she yeah that chewing a bone over there is pretty loud oh you can hear that well i m here too so i was like oh shane can you feed riley for lunch and he s like oh yeah feed and let out and i got home and i was like did you feed and let out riley and he like rolled his eyes at me and he s i m like what i m not allowed to ask and he goes no because that signifies that you don t trust that i did do it and i go well did she A A and he s the same thing happened and i was like well i just want to know for my own sake so that i m not taking her out aimlessly and being like oh she s not pooping and i know she needs to poop because if she s pooped then i m not going to sit out there praying that she ll poop how she pooped she pooped good for her also i was just so distracted while you were telling that story because this shirt is doing A A everything for your eyes really yeah it s a shirt i ve never worn before it s in the same cut that i always get shirts there s two different brands there s two different like brands within the same brand like there s two different oh it s a good material well this is the one i don t like because it s a really deep v and so i never actually wear the shirt but i really really have to go shopping for the podcast you got to get this color and everything well thank you because i was actually going to bring up that i need like i am in dire need of shopping for this podcast specifically because i did even see the last time we recorded i was straight from the gym and then a bunch happened and so i didn t change yeah and somebody said you need to retire that shirt and i m like i know it s been with me for four years and i wear it every day even though i have three and last week you wore a shirt from clever era which was at least like eight years ago right yeah and even just now i went to the closet and i m like i got ta change so that i m not wearing the same thing but i have nothing you only have the same thing also if i hadn t changed i would have totally forgotten that my id is in my titty so thank god back to dia that place A A sucks dia is what you re calling it denver international airport right baby girl oh that s what you wrote on the thing is the world s worst airport not me in the car being like let s die well because i was a just like at all with the way that you can hit two airport airplanes in one day i m in awe yeah what did i say oh is that okay with you i m just testing the waters i don t know you like to be corrected so i m just whoa now we re getting passive aggressive is that what that s called while you re beefing do you want to continue beefing or do you want me to talk about my qualms with the ia let s hear about dia first for those of you in the comment section you re like she never lets him finish his story this is miserable yeah i am miserable do you want to talk about that hole in your heart no oh well i mean i i mean because we need something deep well this is so funny because now two weeks in a row you want to talk about what i want to talk about in my vlog we ll save something for the podcast okay yeah no no i m like yeah let s plug this one make something sacred um no i m happy to talk about this is a repeat again a repeat a repeat a repeat of what your vlog and what whatever you re gon na say oh make it original wait first oh i get what you re saying first tell me about what you hate about dia besides the obvious what what s your diabetes okay what i love about lax we ll start with that nobody loves anything about lax you mean burbank i would i mean yes a small airport burbank is preferable i would do anything to fly out of burbank if possible but if you re going to a bigger airport i think los angeles lax is wonderfully set up because you get dropped off at your specific terminal and there s a security for every terminal like every different airline whereas at dia everyone going everywhere is in the same line oh and then they get on the trolley full of sardines into a trolley which i m positive every time i ve gotten covet has been in that trolley and i was just gon na tell you if i ever was gon na get covet it was going to be my last experience being packed into that trolley like a A A animal because we recently traveled to wyoming and we re on our way back we re trying to get home and we ve landed and i m just trying to get out of that A A airport yeah and we get down to the trolley but there s a million people waiting for it but everyone s running in and i m like i m not missing this because the next one s not for another five minutes and i can t be away from my house for longer than this and everyone i swear to you just everyone s like no we can fit more we can get more psychotic how they push in too it s like what the A A we re all holding on to each other i was like if i was ever gon na get a disease it was going to be in this confined space where there s people where the limit should be oh yeah and it s unavoidable and it s a nightmare and i just thought even on the way out on the way back in i just thought i never want to travel again out of this airport because it s such a freaking nightmare i mean i lost my luggage there like you don t have to tell me twice the dia sucks okay now that i m done with that because yeah flying out of burbank flying out of the small airport in wyoming yeah well burbank s just so chill i just liter i walk there from where i park my car i walk back to my car i m so pissed i bought a scooter and i completely forgot about it you haven t ridden it yeah you should be going to the grocery store you should go everywhere in that scooter it s not motor scooter oh do you still have those motor scooters yes i need to replace the wheel i moved it to this house and actually today on my walk my dog walk i m walking three dogs now which riley s still getting used to the antics of the leash i don t know if it s an answer anyway it s the right word it s maybe it s not it s not a horribly wrong word this smart lady might i add i couldn t do it with three dogs but she s on her electric scooter while her dog s running so that she can like exhaust them exhaust them get it out faster so she can get back to work or the rest of her day but it was real annoying for me because i have three dogs that are all worried about the dog and the scooter and they re all so it disrupted my walk it put like a one and a half minute pause on my already minute walk and by the end of my walk i ve been getting a little cranky oh weird you cranky my dog i took my dogs for a walk the other morning usually we ve been walking them at nighttime because it s so A A hot i ve got dog shamed i know yeah well you yeah so you get it we go at night time after the sun has sat so that this asphalt s not hella hot no yes and yeah i know you re not i googled that i was like dog shaming you didn t no but one of my neighbors did oh you don t remember what i mean i do i do and you were mad at me because i wasn t on your side yes i was walking on a dirt road they were fine there s natural grass everywhere my dad s also abusing his golden retriever by walking him in the daytime i m hot A A i just think like keep it to yourself it wasn t degrees outside don t comment on how i m caring i felt like i was being mom shamed um but i did google the temperature that it s because asphalt is like hot as A A it like doubles the rule is if you can t keep your hand on it they can t keep their pawn and i google the specific temperature that s agreed upon by most vets and it s degrees over you should not be walking your dogs fun fact so i ve been and i mean don t quote me on it but from my extensive research on google that is what i found i personally don t like to walk hotter than that anyways because it s not a fun experience for anyone it wasn t higher than that when i got dog shamed just saying it was close but it wasn t higher than that and i really couldn t let it go obviously it s been how long has it been like two months a long time it s been two months we ve even talked about it on the podcast like every time we ve met something happened to you except for last week maybe but then you talked about how fat honey is and you got fat shamed okay i ll stop we ll see my life is very interesting right now okay okay i don t have much going on anyways my dog stopped can i tell you something yeah anyways is not the actual word anyway yeah somebody in our comment section corrected the two of us saying they would prefer that it s anyway so why are you disregarding that correction because i don t care and so maybe i don t care about some of yours and that s fine but i m also pointing that out like just you got ta embrace it you got ta embrace who you are honey okay what were you talking about before i so rudely interrupted you oh i was just gon na say we saw a guy on a scooter the other day on our walk okay but the dogs were just like stunned they just they were like like if jelly had been there she would have like chased that A A down and like what the A A are you you know what i mean she d be like daddy were you working more like whatever it was that s always jelly s vibe to protect um but the the two boys just stopped and they re like what is that i watched it go all the way down the street back to his house i was like guys we got ta go and that s what i mean it really put like a two to five minute stop in my walk well i ve also started letting them do whatever the A A they want on the walk like sniffing whatever which isn t great for like leash etiquette but i m like is leash etiquette for them or me and it feels like it s for me honestly yeah it does feel selfish to the human and so it s like this what do they A A live for this walk like let them have this walk man and i try to do a happy mixture where it s like okay we re gon na really smell everything right now and then we re gon na do minutes of just walking yeah because i also read that the smelling is what knocks them out like it makes them sleepy oh cause it makes their well both of them it makes their brains think they re thinking about the smell that they re smelling but if it s just a walk it s gon na take me twice as long to exhaust these A A so you re just like smell everything yeah or twice as far but i m just like yeah get your sniffs in but then the other thing is like the baby doesn t have this flu shot yet so i m like don t sniff the pb blue yeah i m giving them flu shots because i m taking the baby to training i didn t know is that like the board or the the one that no that s that one this is a flu shot okay the vet told me i had every shot i could have for my dog so i hope that she s right i mean it probably is it s specifically like we didn t do it last year and i m starting to think when jelly was very sick at the beginning of the year that was the flu oh because joe kept saying like it s like she s really really sick like she just has some like a like a sickness instead of it being about her cancer or pancreatitis or an ulcer or anything and he s like right because the it s i don t want to get into it it s gross it turns into vomit talk i think we we re going to talk about the deep hole in your um being oh i mean that came before the trauma i was born with a hole in my heart okay so elaborate oh my god we were going to talk about everything i said at lunch yeah i think it s good did it deep okay what do you like what do you want me to extrapolate so basically i was talking about as i do in my vlog this week you can t take this from me i ve pre planned it okay as long as you sell me a story right now then we re fine basically i was just talking about how there s like um you know last week s vlog is all about gratitude and i noticed that a lot of the comments in my comment section are about people s gratitude for their you know sobriety however long it may be and i you we were just talking about like what sobriety is for me because it s not just not drinking and using it s also working on filling the hole in my heart and i call it a hole in my heart because it s like i was born with a deficit or like a deficiency and it s the and that s what i think of like and it s not depression it s i think some people could could diagnose it as depression i think some people could diagnose it as anxiety and adhd would you say what s the overlining feeling though is that that you ll never be satisfied prior to it s thought prior to treating it s i am undeserving of love and life wow and i think that that is indicative of my alcoholism but it s not just alcohol that s my problem because it s also like i told you at lunch like i just have a big problem everything i do i want to do it big right and i will do it big because it s like once i step one foot out of my mental sobriety and i pick up something that i quote unquote use be it a credit card be it alcohol be it marijuana be it pills whatever the A A that one pickup is the last choice i can make consciously because you were saying as you got older you realize that you can fill or mask some of the hole with substances i have a really stupid analogy okay i m ready have you ever noticed on instagram reels or tik tok when they have those videos of like a jalapeno that s got a bite taken out of it and then they fill like the jalapeno with top of ramen noodles and then they file down the top ramen noodles and then they put glue in the top of ramen noodles oh first they put glue then they file down the noodles and then they paint it to make it look like the jalapeno and never had a bite taken out of it but you know it s filled with ramen noodles so it s not actually whole i wish i could relate but i just described it in great detail can you not can you make eggnog and he just i blacked out at the fact that i had never seen the visual A A i was like i m so upset that i ve never seen this visual but i m kind of with you yeah are you anyways for those of you who did listen at home that s kind of what it is like i can i with alcohol with weed with drugs with money with whatever the A A with negative behavior negative attention i can patch the hole but it still exists so once uh like the only good thing about removing those substances is now i have a proper wound to treat instead of one that s gon na get infected you re forced to face what the wound is initially and you can actually heal it and what were i mean you don t have to elaborate if you don t want but what were some of your findings like what were some of your revelations when you were getting sober that you needed to work upon i think the biggest revelation the biggest revelation this is also funny at lunch i kept saying we were talking about how we argue with people and lizzy said i ve come to a conclusion that if i can t uh if i pause think about it and then can t explain what my problem is in two words then it it s not worth it and i need to let it go and so i said what was my question you said like what s like what can you express the two words and i said important things and you said but what is that and i said he s like but what with two words can you do that i was like well i just did it with two words important things and i said well there s not one fight in my life that i could take a pause from and say two words that would like paint the picture of while i m still mad except like i m frustrated but then that still doesn t do it but then i asked her a like very specific question and she kept repeating my question in her answer as if it was an interview like i m like what specifically hurt you the most and she s like the thing that specifically hurt me the most i m a well trained girl my mom s an english teacher i m ready to answer essay questions i didn t know that i mean kind of what does kind of an english teacher mean i mean i like honestly mom no offense i don t really know my mom s a special lady anyways one of the things i actually learned was that um the uh you know how like it s so easy for me to hate things and people and sometimes it seems absurd how much i hate that person or thing or obsess about it yeah that so that is because i don t i like my foundation is i don t deserve to be loved so i get really and i guess the most appropriate word is jealous and then punitive to people who act as if they re worthy of love right and to me the simple act of the confidence to exist and express oneself freely is indicative of someone believing they re worthy of love and i m just like A A that and A A you because you don t and that s A A and so what has helped you overcome that phase this is the one that i have to work on the most regularly is because it s so that s the word it s so ingrained because it s something i was it was a it was a born with feeling so to get rid of that it takes like constant um belief in uh the fact that i am lovable right and the fact that love isn t something that you know people are or are not worthy of it just is yeah like people are just loved people are just love so embracing that and understanding that and accepting that helps a lot but i really need the constant reminder which is like why i go to places as regularly as i can where their motto is we will love you until you love yourself oh that is one of the mottos i mean that s i don t think it s a slogan written on a A A card hanging in a church but it s a point that s hit frequently it s something that s said a lot okay and you don t understand it or you roll your eyes at it at first and then like if you keep coming back eventually the the truth of that statement settles into that hole in my heart and it s like maybe i don t hate little xan maybe i just hate myself so let s relate this to julia fox that s different she s not deserving whoa you can t be a realized person i m kidding i know and that s why we love you that was a joke i don t hate julia fox oh i know you just i find rage i hate what she s doing i don t even know that i hate what she s doing like i hate little zan but like i don t i don t even know which one that is it s diego it s one of tiana mojo s exes oh he s the one that s got the tattoos all over his face again i realize that s a non unique trait but um yeah not a big fan of lausanne wow but i guess he s deserving of love too because we all are because no one deserves it we just hour and a half you know seems like you re treated i m cured someone said that i said that the other day this guy was like i haven t seen you around it s like oh i figured it out he s like like that s the most toxic thing i could say in one of these rooms by the way like i was totally joking i was like no i m good i m good i m cured forever cured i just took steps now i m good wow and i don t know if we ve already talked about this but do you not have urges just to because like me even after a long day even if it wasn t stressful like sometimes i just crave a glass of wine even like the smell of it the aroma it s like a coffee to me i miss the ritual and inclusion with groups but that s why i do shots of energy drinks right to be part of the rituals sorry i m laughing i know no that s like yeah yeah but it s like i i honestly like i really miss the ritual and the and the community but then i see my community when they re not doing shots of red bull but shots of hard alcohol and i m like i don t miss that no i don t miss that at all yeah um i don t miss the anxiety and depression that s guaranteed to come after sometimes even during i don t miss that at all yeah i definitely miss molly all the time i wish i was a normal person i ve never done that gosh i really wish i was a normal person and could do molly every day because normal people do drugs every day and sometimes like i miss like do you remember when you re like in high school and you first start smoking weed and you just do it like once every year maybe like i miss the thrill of that one time you get high but it s like i can t just get high one time and it s annoying because everyone s like marijuana is not addictive it s like girl i m addicted i know so many people addicted to marijuana but it s like i m addicted to A A everything i m addicted to gluten even though it A A my body up riley right it s not a cheap toy she s eating the tripod baby riley finn now she s stopped cause she knows she s in trouble she knows oh my sweet little gorgeous princess your little foot head baby okay so do you want to talk about while you re heavily grounded i think you should touch upon your recognization you re wrecking oh well let s leave that ground are you just trying to avoid the beef i have with you for the A A A A whichever story you want to start i just want to really quickly while i m sitting here super vulnerable and grounded with you let you know that i have a resentment against you i should have never told you this you really shouldn t have it was an insane thing for you to do and it s like the way you looked at me when you said it was like you wanted a fight you know what i mean but it was weird because you did it off camera so it felt really personal like you didn t bring it here to like start some A A it was like you did it in our real life mm hmm well no i mean it was truthful we get dr phil on the line i swear to god i m like looking at what was i looking at oh i needed to tell you what the uber costing but i was looking at it i can t i m still haven t looked at the ober i was looking at crumble cookies and this week they seem to be like cake themed or like whatever it doesn t matter i would like to try them this week he goes oh i had them but i left them at my mom s house because i didn t want you to have any of them well no in real time it was my sister s birthday yesterday and so we went over to celebrate so shane got the big party box and it is uh frequent it when i m thinking about the like the truth when i m thinking about the extended about the truth it really does break my heart for you from me like bad me uh because you do once a week like say like have you seen the crumble flavors did you try them are they worth it which one s worth it should i try it like that s something you frequently ask me well it s because in la it s either like i pay in time spent to go get them or i pay extra for a delivery and it s like is it worth that or are these going to sit and rot on my counter and last week s totally worth it everyone was out of damn home run i feel like you just we didn t respond to my time last week this weeks were i wouldn t none of them were great to me we have a reverse taste in them because it s crazy love that animal cracker every time that lizzie likes one shane and i hate it yeah we re except for shane and i on the sugar cookie yeah if there s anything remotely sugar cookie about one i text shane and i m like listen you should probably try this one so that s like the extent of my relationship with shane to some degree have you tried this crumble cookie will you read my script Laughter can i steal this A A from you thank you we can t have them around the house because we like to get them once a week to try the flavors and then like send them to my family or get rid of them but we can t bring them back home because then we re just gon na end up eating them because they re all it makes me sick it makes me sick too and that s the thing is every time i eat with lizzy she eats to a point where she tells me how sick she is for three hours afterwards and so i just thought even because my mom goes you should take each flavor for lizzy and i was like she s gon na eat all of them and then she s gon na be sick and then she s not gon na be able to perform on the podcast and i told lizzy that verbatim and i just watched her heart break i was devastated but it was rude i should have got that just that it was thought of and it doesn t matter cause i m already sick to my stomach right now and i couldn t even tell you why well we went and got fried pickles for lunch yeah but i i literally from the beginning of my day to now i have made a very conscious effort to not A A with any gluten because i m sick of it and it did say the fried pickles were gluten free and vegan which is so special right like so is all this sauce gluten free because we left there i showed you my belly she did in public it s like wild in public wild no i m not i bet there s videos we could probably search your name on tick tock and find videos and you re screaming obscenities in your house like how much i would love that if you could find that of me i know you would and that brings us to a good segue well i just wanted to say when you you just told me you were perplexed about not being able to find your uber charge and so today she was like trying to pay for half the lunch and i was like oh it s fine and she s like oh no i will and i said just minus it from your uber and i ll oh so it s just one transaction she goes and i was like okay just pay for lunch i figured out how to venmo you for the lunch i thought you were trying i know i just thought it was funny like you know the editing yeah don t ask me how to do math it s literally this okay now into your segue i m sorry what i did was not worth taking over the segway no i i do think it s funny but it s one of those moments that s like better in person you know yeah most of our things are which is why we re making a movie our podcast is so great we re better in person everything s better in person all right hit up well hold on let me see anything else okay this is fine we can come back for the other things because it is just such an appropriate segue right so i was um and in in this last vlog i was at a bachelorette party in vegas and we go to costco at first and none of us really know each other and i have a hole in my heart and sometimes it s filled by being an A A and one of the assholey things i was like it s like you know because i say this to you all the time and it s like honestly i am joking but i m also not joking like i m a little joking but it s like i m not joking about what if i don t like i ll i ll say sometimes to someone like quietly like if i do not get recognized i m gon na A A leave what do you guys want anything from starbucks no thank you i m okay thank you um so i ll say that and i ll be joking and then if it does end up happening i feel really awkward and bad because i i feel really awkward and nervous and weird because i m we i m a broken person i don t know what you want from cheers and it can t be filled with recognition um or can it no it can t but i was like like i was joking with joe the whole time like i better get recognized in front of these A A like oh for nothing you know what i mean i m just being psychotic you know if you re here you know i m out of my A A mind and so i d been saying that the whole time and like just being absurd and then in costco it s like what happens to you in public it was wild someone screamed my name and i just turned and looked thinking it was one of the girls because i was alone we had all dispersed and gone about the costco to get the A A that we wanted so i was by myself and i hear someone shout lizzy and so i look thinking it s one of the girls and someone goes i was right that s lizzy from the sip and i went i ve been recognized and when we walked in the cop into the costco like as a group of A A i was like i just hope i don t get recognized here like was joking and then it happened and i was alone and i was like do i tell them oh it cut out today s podcast is sponsored by calm and you know how it goes your day is filled

week s vlog anyways oh okay joe watches joe s like the biggest supporter of my vlog never seen the podcast but well he s seen an episode that was enough for him i did ruin it i ruined our chances mitchell so anyways i like my first thought was do i tell them like do i tell the girls i ve been recognized in my mind i can envision you being like can you do that one more time when all my friends come you know i ve done that right mr bubbs got recognized at a museum one time and this guy goes your dog looks a lot like mr bubsico he is mr bubs and he went oh my god that s awesome and then i went this is gon na sound crazy um would you be willing to do that again but let me film it it was like what i was like well see i do this thing where i call it vlogging and i was just wondering if you could just say exactly the beats that you just said again as if it were your first time but do it while i m filming and he let me and it s in one of my vlogs but yes i do do that joe said it doesn t count if you have to tell people it happened and then i told them but they thought i was doing a bit and so it was all just super demoralizing but i just wound up checking joe and i was like well i did tell them and they think i m joking and i m not joking and so it just looks extra bad there s no recovering from this like i m just such a A A A A and i can t stop it s like once i start going down the hill of being an A A it s like a gain oh yeah you know you know you were all here we all know i don t mean any of it which is why i can laugh and then sometimes i catch someone who like doesn t know i m joking and i m like oh this makes me want to yeah if i didn t know you i wouldn t know half the time that s why i can t go through like a line ordering food situation with chipotle sweet greens i would never go to puzzle anyways okay it s trash it s disgusting makes me sick i can t do the meat from like any of those places especially the chicken because they re all thighs and the thighs makes me really think about the chicken and then like it s just a different taste about it A A sick i don t trust chicken quite frankly it makes me like like i don t like it but i did eat all the chicken on the salad today because i was ready to get hungry when i got to the airport it was a delicious salad i just dropped my mouth okay um so in the last episode i don t know how we got to wiki pages i don t remember chris pratt chris pratt if you missed it oh you thought i was saying someone said nasty A A on your wiki page yes because you targeted it at me no i just i speak about like the proverbial you um okay as in one so we thought do we even have that i m sure you did i thought it could be fun to google live i m using my phone as so we can use my phone but i just want to be very clear i don t have high hopes for having a wiki page and it is already devastating to the point where like my ears are ringing and i feel bad about myself what did he say to your tit pic yes i took this for you he said the sexiest wow he said loved your grateful model you re a grateful montage oh that is cute he goes i said i live for you anyways all right do i have a wiki what are you looking at the glee project alums call out traumatic treatment and boot camp like conditions we were children wow yeah sad where are they now ryland adams what s gon na come up oh you re just gon na google yeah okay is this wikipedia i don t know should i just go to wikipedia google round it out items wikipedia you have one i knew it i knew it i m not even shocked is it really a long is it worth

relapse whoa oh my god just kidding i don t mean that i don t mean that at all i m joking it s dark it s dark here we re doing dark things dark girl things do you want to know about it A A i m not clickable that s the end of this segment moving on just read me the highlights known profession ryan adams born may th known professionally as ryland adams is an american youtuber in he became an on air host and producer for clever an online pop culture media company boring boring boring is it yeah oh this is boring well i think it shows that you re a self starter adam s entered into a relationship with fellow youtuber and also clickable shane dawson in as of february his videos oh dark that s dark what as of february his videos average million views what is dark about that that now it s nowhere close to that oh is that dark you re perfect huge numbers um okay born oh it says i was born in denver colorado hop fact i was born in youtube you don t even know him they have my

mentioned which in mine you know what i ll take it i will make it about me if i can okay what did they say about me in yours adam s announced and released his first episode of the podcast the sip alongside his co host lizzie gordon that s me okay did you want to talk about the woodstock show before we get into advice do you want to see the one wiki i am on i am on a wiki page oh a feet no but i m on that too i m on a wiki page called awful movie wiki no yes i am and is was it a movie you wrote it s a movie i wrote produced and starred in that joe directed and it just talks about how bad the movie is yeah it s kind of funny it s nice being on a page you know remember i was talking a few episodes back about how toxic it is when people thrive even on negative attention no when did you say that what was the point i m like they re blinded by the attention that even if it s negative it s fine what i m not on awful movie wiki the movie is and so i m basically just a byproduct of the movie the writer and the star isn t even a part no wow god that s upsetting moving on the film stars lizzie gordon who s also the writer is that it why it sucks Laughter the trivia question is lizzie gordon my name is spelled wrong lazy ie gordon who why why does it suck you can t just skip over the hottest part okay i mean there s a lot of points there s points to why this there s reasons why um what s the movie called so everyone can watch it i don t want them to watch it no can i tell you why i don t want people to watch it sorry because i was financially abused in the making of this film the production company that made it didn t pay me appropriately and they never paid joe what he was owed and agreed to and on top of that they make money every time you watch it legally so if you are gon na watch this dumpster fire piece of A A awful movie steal it or you re paying my abuser i m not laughing at the paying your abuser i m laughing that you re telling people to steal something steal it but also like just don t even watch it it s such a flaming piece of A A it s hard to watch like the producer who made it prize on the passion and dreams of young people in los angeles trying to make their way in this world and he will take hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors who are also actors who think that they re going to be in a movie that s going to launch their career but then he steals that money for himself to pay for drugs and alcohol and prostitution that makes a really low budget shitty movie makes a really low budget shitty movie and then pays back the investors once they sell which they don t sell for much but they do sell for a little bit and he pays them back with the money from the next project so it s like a ponzi scheme where he s constantly scamming people and continues to work but he worked himself out of la i think he s in chicago now whoa yeah anyways steal the A A movie don t pay for it it will never not surprise me the links that cons can go also this is like genres this is an exhausting con like there are better ways to steal money this guy s teeth are rotting out of his head and his pants are constantly covered doesn t matter like he s working himself to the bone not making good movies and honestly like working pretty hard if he is like on a lot of drugs working really hard for being a person who s trying to be a thief but the trivia part lizzie gordon spelled wrong who plays the protagonist ashley and is the film s writer as the god daughter of academy award winning actress helen hunt i mean you re climbing your way there i think it s so funny i think it s so funny anyways anyways um okay what did you have about woodstock it s woodstock my brother was talking about this last night so he watched the documentary yeah i have not yet dabbled should we wait until we ve both seen it or do you want it in line i mean we can but by the time you do like it ll then five years yeah and i won t remember it if they don t talk about it the week i want yeah i mean i also texted you multiple times and was like watch the victoria s secret documentary i tried and we re like go A A yourself that s why we watch those things i tried i was right where you re sitting and five minutes in and then i was like guess it wasn t i honestly did the same which is why i never brought it up again but the woodstock documentary um stayed awake during woodstock now well it s a great it s a really well edited piece honestly it kind of reminded me a little bit of how like good shane is and and evoking emotions from a person watching one of his series this thing was really good at keeping you on like in it like i was editing while i was watching it and i kept finding myself getting lost in it and i had headphones on you know what i mean like so i kept getting lost in it and um it was just so interesting to listen to the perspective of the people who threw it because it was a monster A A show and also i remember woodstock constantly being like the punch line of jokes i don t know much about it at all so the original woodstock was like a free love peace whatever movement music festival a lot coachella but like of their time nitty gritty dirty people were camping out forever so many people showed up it was like worse than tanacon like i m just saying it in relatable terms for you right no thank you so it s and it s like raining and there s like mudslides and it s A A gross but like you know jimmy hendrix is wheeling on the guitar and it s like a whole A A yeah it s a whole A A moment of a collective group of people of the time doing something that nobody thought you could ever A A do and it was gnarly so in a few people want to recreate it and the first thing that they do wrong is they capitalize the food and beverage part of it so already it s like a mainstream sellout thing when they re they have all these bands coming in like corn and olympics biscuit which is like you know let s rage against the machine type of A A they re using the marketing of what was this amazing one of a kind event and some of the people behind that like that behind this movement were of the original woodstock right and so it s like the same emotions to it but it s like no matter what like in fire festival which i still pronounce this fryer festival because i m a A A idiot it s a huge investment and you need to pay back your investors yeah so they re like oh the way that we ll do that is by charging people for food and water so initially like instantly coca cola became the people behind it wow which is a major sellout move for like a vibe like that the second thing that was A A wild is the people that could afford these tickets and who were down to come to this show were like dudes in college in it s a whole A A different elk like they re a different kind of guy like kid rock is their god and it s like i get that because kid rock is my god too the difference is i m not safe in that crowd in which was shown in this documentary where all these women who are like showing their tits and A A are getting horribly groped while they re thrown through the the you know like how you can crowd surf and it s supposed to be like a fun A A empowering thing these women felt so empowered on the first day of the festival that they were walking around naked fearlessly which i think is great that s A A awesome at a co ed event to have that kind of comfort that to have that kind of free like vibe whatever and then to have that go so darkly and twistedly south like cheryl crow was performing and everyone just kept screaming at her show your tits and it s like i ve been known to scream show your tits but it s like it s a facetious thing i don t need it i don t mean it and i m saying it because of how horrific it was back whatever so that s horrible then it goes from bad to worse nobody could afford food or water because it was so expensive so they re all getting really A A irritated the whole weekend and they re just on drugs and drink and have no water to drink except for the free public water which by day two had become infested with feces yuck so by day three A A were getting trench mouth did they have footage from the time oh wow it s okay did we have cell phones then it was covered by mtv oh wow mtv had correspondence there like what s his name from live trl oh carson daly carson daly was covering it and it s A A wild these people were like the next day my throat hurt i couldn t swallow i had huge sores all over my mouth that s trench mouth it s A A sick so the other thing is like you know corn unicorns heavy like they go they go hard like james had corn in the car the other day and i had to like stop him i was like it s too much i was like it is nine o clock in the morning what s going on and what the A A is this because it s like i ve heard mainstream corn but i ve never heard like deep corn and i didn t know i don t think i have dude actually when we re done with this i m gon na have to play you the song because the fact that it was out of the car i was like this has to be something like super underground because it s so A A gnarly it s so A A gnarly anyways corn comes on and the crowd goes A A ape A A and it s like violent and crazy and like people are like beating the A A out of each other in the mosh pits and like screaming like gnarly security guards were like it was weird like at one point everybody would be here and then in the blink of an eye they d move six feet as a communal group of like people like that s how hard the crowd was going and um you know it just escalates off that and turns into this horrible A A up thing there was a rave room where like dj fat slim don t look at me for facts fat slim so where does this live it lives on netflix but it gets so A A gnarly to the point where on the last night red hot chili peppers are playing a song which is um god they they did it in wayne s world too i can t remember but cassandra does a cover of this jimi hendrix song about and there s the word fire in it stan staying next to mfa it s nothing like what i m doing right now and it s i don t think it s come on maybe light my fire either um i ll think of it in the second we stopped recording and it s so unimportant to the rest of the story okay the point the point being there was fire it was jimmy these people were all given lit candles as a unifying sort of tribute to gun violence and that was not cleared by the fire marshal but then all these people when this jimi hendrix song comes on starts lighting fires in trash cans that turn into huge huge out of control fires and the firemen were like we re not going in there these people have been batshit crazy for three days they re starving they re on drugs they re thirsty they ve got trench mouth i m not going in there to fight that fire with maniacs which i get and so what happened it burned up propane tanks exploded how many people died honestly i m not sure any died whoa but that s a great question and are you finished with it is it a series is it a movie is it a documentary it s a documentary series so how many episodes i don t know it was on all day though this is like i was doing other things because do you ever watch tv undistracted yeah when it s A A i care about emily in paris hell yeah not kidding how sad is that i hate watch it with every fiber of my baby that s what uncoupled was for me with neil patrick harris it s this is so A A funny a year old man with a pre existing heart condition was the only man that passed away maybe netflix new three part documentary series train wreck woodstock remembers the chaos that ensued at the attempted revival of the woodstock music festival instead of the the festival s original promise of peace and love the rendition resulted in riots arson and death nearly people attended whoa which was just about miles uh from the original site limp biscuit was there dude honestly this one of the most like sort of like um emotionally engaging things of this documentary series for me was the nostalgia for these bands because i love that A A like there s nothing that i love more than a A A angry A A screaming like oh i love it so much i love it so much it s toxic so that was fun because i i if i had been a man at the time i would have had a great time at woodstock i would have had a really A A good time woodstock but then when i brought it up to joe and james who were of age to be there at that time they were like even then it seemed like a weird stupid sellout thing like that nobody really wanted to go to so the vibe of the documentary series seemed off to them i can t speak to it because i was nine but it s the way he leads through the background all right let s get into some advice though are you sure it s time yeah okay you should go for it i ve read so much today what have you been reading i read our wiki delayed i m terrified that it might be i don t know how to check my updates though your gate has changed oh all right hi girlies i m a year old that still lives with her parents i ve been in my first local relationship for about nine months and he s honestly been the best and most respectful person the problem is their relationship with my parents they re very religious and now and have now given me several talks about not having sex and to be cautious about the type of things i wear like shorts i find it a bit extreme on their part especially because they ve recently prohibited me from going to his house as we d be alone and it could be a moment of quote weakness they claim to be supportive of our relationship but have talked A A since we started dating all because he s not religious luckily my boyfriend has been very patient with my parents but it hurts to feel like they won t have a positive relationship if me and him are going for the long term i ve always had to choose between my happiness versus making my parents happy and this has all been very frustrating hope this made sense any advice really helps love you guys i wish that her parents happiness was uh a product of hers yes and i m not a parent so i don t know how hard that would be if my all of my core beliefs felt misrepresented in my child s choice but at the end of the day i do feel it s necessary to find a way to take yourself out of your child s happiness but that doesn t help her that s advice for her parents yeah do you have their number do you want to send us their number i m happy to give them a call i m on a weird like power trip right now and i would love to just be like listen guys like i love that you have this love for your religion and your daughter and you want the best for her but sometimes what s best for her is is you actually wanting what s best for her yeah i mean religion sexuality a lot of those things even if you have expectations of your kid being a football player a baseball player and they have interest in arts or drama or swimming it i did always um well now i really applaud my parents for encouraging me in whatever direction i wanted like i did gymnastics for a long time to the point where i was about to do traveling like going be on the team that travels and my dad was always like yeah go for it this is great he d go to practice he dropped me off for practice never questioned like how A A gay that was stop it s not that gay no another straight gymnast i m just saying it for myself you know but uh i mean i think that will be very challenging as a parent as we come into if my daughter brings home a dick wiggler it s going to be hard see we all have our things it s going to be hard i don t even care if he s more rich and famous and successful than i will ever even dream to be you don t care if he s offering to buy you a house if it s little honey i would be like all right please don t touch her so as the child well as this woman that s writing in not child child of her parents what advice do you have for her though the bummer is my advice is to be what they are struggling to be it s to exemplify how it s the golden rule you treat others how you want to be treated regardless of how they treat you you and it s hard like i m literally telling you this as a person who s not in your position so it s really A A easy for me to say this but from if i were i would hope that if i were in your position i would have patience and understanding and love for them because it sounds like you do love them because you re willing to sacrifice your own happiness for theirs and that s a huge thing for someone to do so i have to assume you love them so continuing to love them have understanding for their religious perspective and patience while you treat yourself with the same love and respect for what brings you happiness mom and dad i love you and i love my boyfriend they don t have to coexist and their their religious persecution does not have to be your business and i understand that it s nearly impossible to divorce the two while living in the house and hearing what they re saying but it s just like what i was trying to tell you at lunch like if there s not something i can do to rectify the situation with two words it means i m trying to control something that is out of my control forever right i can not control people places or things and sometimes like you were saying we were talking about it in regards to fighting with anyone and you were saying well some things just need to be let go to let go of some things and move on and i was like i don t know if that s true because like what if i m not done being angry about the thing that i m holding on to and you were like not valid and i was like well i think it depends on the circumstance i also think that s a deeply masculine character why why because i ve heard a lot of men say that and i ve noticed because i m a fighter so i fight with a lot of people and i ve noticed that more often than not when i m fighting with a man he cares about the specific details of the argument as opposed to the overarching umbrella theme issue which is most commonly boiled down to i m hurt you re hurt we re hurting each other and that and you can simplify it like that but it s like i do think like bringing up an old wound over time constantly and always going back to that isn t going to help you so i agree like creating a solution for the overarching problem is the best way to go but if you re not there yet it s hard to close that chapter if you re still being hurt in the same way i totally get it i m not sure if this is a perfect analogy but it s like if i shoot you with the gun there s a couple of problems right specifically there s a hole in you but in order to fix that hole in you we really got to focus on me just like stopping shooting you great because we can uh you know we can deal with this hole in you and i can shoot you again and you re gon na have a new hole do you see what i m saying so the specifics of the holes are less important and the more important thing is stop the pattern of me shooting you okay do you see what i m saying yes and that s all that s my that s my and i guess it to me it depends on the gravity of the situation like if you were cheated on that seems like oh that s that s something that s connected with two words there are we re done okay back to you i know you re it would be the worst dude i m so sorry A A that A A though honestly i know that it sucks ass living with your parents you know what i think if you are financially capable i think it might be best for you to start your own journey even if it s very even if it s only a mile from your parents having your own space to create your own life because is not a child and i think ideally you come together with your parents because obviously it sounds like you love them and the idea is that everyone gathers and has a wonderful time because there s nothing better than having your parents get along well with your significant other but i think if you kind of detached a little bit from the daily stresses of feeling the weight of their religion on your life that might be a good solution for now there s also i don t know if this pertains to you because you didn t specifically say your this is your problem but later in life i learned about this world or later in my young life i learned about the word enmeshment where you can become as a child enmeshed with your parent which means that your feelings are seemingly predicated upon your parents feelings and because of that you become sort of codependently enmeshed in your parental relationship and it has sort of an emotionally stunting effect on a person it keeps you like a child mindfully for too long and a supporting a subordinate for too long so it s really important that you um find the mindfulness to deconnect your cord from them so that you can be your own person and evolve into your own adulthood and you can have all that and still love them yeah and i think constantly over time if you show them that you re in a loving relationship they re going to come to terms with oh maybe he s not the same religion that we had hoped for but he s giving my daughter everything emotionally and like he is a good man i think over time they will come to terms with what actually is and if they never do i and if he s the one and you re with him forever i strongly encourage you to um come to find a way to protect your joy and your space mentally without needing to control your parents because you can not do that you can not change your parents minds you can not do anything that the and they may change on on of their own will and volition nothing you do is going to change that so if i were you i would focus your time and energy mentally on accepting them as they are and embracing and celebrating your individuality and your relationship with this guy who s good to you amen okay we got an update from a previous submission update hey there not sure if anyone does updates for am i the A A so i m the gal that wrote in about two or three months ago regarding my wicked sisters and them selling my mother s house after school i m so glad you reached out so i took your advice thank you and i asked my sisters for a meeting they refused and sent a sheriff to my house one week later to kick me out they gave me days notice and then changed the locks on the doors after i moved out so i will not be buying the house for sure now i decided lizzy is right they are wicked sisters and i have said A A it i found a new place to rent i said a heart wrenching goodbye to my dogs and moved out a couple of days ago since i felt like i was on a roll with getting toxic people out of my life i decided to end my seven year relationship he was toxic as A A too i made the decision to A A them all i chose me maybe i can mourn properly and heal my mind in heart thank you so much you have no idea how much your advice helped and then sorry uno is barking i m crying she says p s i m a bit lonely uh maybe a hamster named sippy oh i just realized sippy s because of our sip show yeah that s beautiful dude i m so sorry A A all of that A A all of that so hard and i m proud of you yeah i mean i can t imagine the strength it took for you to be able to stand up for yourself and thank you for writing back and giving us the update i do think within your new life you re going to find blessings that you had never expected because in ways of having and being able to keep that house you would have fond memories and um be in a space you re familiar with i do think going to a new space creating a new environment for yourself and starting over is going to bring you things that you never expected yeah i m not i got ta say like i got chills all over my body and my eyes filled with tears and i m A A sorry i m hella proud of you because i know that s really hard i ve been blessed in the past where the people that i don t want in my life when they get a sense of me building a self esteem and a boundary it s like they respond like a vampire to garlic and they fizzle off on their own so i ve never had to have the courage to be like A A off but it s uh especially when it s your sister s and your relationship of a long time yo send us pictures of the hamster honestly so cute i love that they re great pets i m wishing you the best though and i hope uh your new life is filled with everything you ve imagined even if it hurts right now i think building something new and that is completely you and discovering who you without all of these things are will be incredible yeah it s like uh you know how like grocery stores have to do an inventory and throw away rotten A A you took an inventory you threw away the rotten A A your shelves are clear right now for some good ass stuff and i m excited for your next chapter that comes after this period of grieving because i know that that s really A A hard and i uh can tell you that there are glimpses like cuz i m sad as A A i m always like don t do it like stay like hold on to everything like a tornado s coming like you can control the tornado but it s like to be completely honest like there are glimmers of like me having a feeling of like oh today s beautiful oh i love my life granted immediately after i have that thought i get back into my like morning thoughts but it s just to even have that hope of that and then to find a way to find the balance of grief and new at the same time i think will come and it might be a slow build it might be really hard for a while and have patience i think it s going to be ultimately worth it and i think looking back in a couple of years you re not going to imagine what your life would have been like had you been in the same space how did you always were had you continued to waste your time with rotten food also i m gon na pitch that you get a ginger hamster and it is about me oh my god what i didn t announce my babies oh since we last spoke i ve had two more babies and all of my girls are in this world now all your everyone that was pregnant has popped them out how many are there now there s uh gosh i don t i don t know if i m allowed to say all their names oh there s uh millie lily cody and ellie okay four mm hmm wow oh no like no and hayden i m one boy hayden it s kind of like you sending me like seven pictures a day of your dog i think everyone s happy for everyone to have a baby but the people that like don t know any of these people i don t know that they i have absolutely super emotional these human babies are like the french bulldogs of humans like they are so goddamn cute and perfect what everyone thinks their babies are perfect no these aren t my babies they re adorable though like they re honestly so A A cute okay the one boy hayden is my friend cynthia s kid and he s barely even a larva pup but that dude smiles and listens like are you A A kidding me and mills was born with a head full of hair her real name s milani but i m calling her mills i m playing with millie but i think mills is good like mills and lilz you know what i m saying all right last one before we go hello ryland and lizzy and chris i m and i ve been with my boyfriend for years we live together and i love him so much but a problem that i ve had a lot is that i always catch him looking at other girls while we re out together i told him how much it kills me and he has had and he has made it less obvious when it when he looks but i still catch him doing it he claims he never looks i just want to know if i have a right to feel upset should i not care do i confront him again when he s doing it i m a cancer so am i just being too sensitive i hope you guys can help me out gosh i don t know if he s really doing that that s really upsetting Music yeah i think i would feel yeah it s hard not to feel offended by that especially if you re experiencing it in real time i was trying to relate it to porn but it s like a real life scenario that you re witnessing in real time of a person that s tangible yeah rather than like somebody behind a screen i wonder how much is it s hard to know like i guess in your gut you know what is him checking out another person rather than just like casually looking at people that are going by yeah i um i don t know like i was talking about this with my friend sarah because i m particularly like nope you know what i mean in regards to what i was trying to tell sarah that if i had been i i would not be a pers i would not be comfortable at all being touched by one of the male dancers at thunder down under oh i would be very upset about it i would feel like it was cheating and not cool and that s at a dance show yeah um and she said you know other people have different relationships and um you know she there are some people who have the security within their relationship to be polyamorous there are people who have the com like the kind of relationship where they can say to each other like i have a crush on this person at work and i want to A A them i you know i have friends who have rules about their open relationship where they re allowed to step out and sleep with whoever they want as long as it doesn t come home like things like that and it s just that is not me a lot of gay guys i know will even like go to restaurants or bars and talk about all the hot guys they saw there together and be like oh that restaurant always attracts hot guys and i m like if i ever heard shane talking like that it would really make my stomach turn yeah and that s not like what i m looking to do with him like i don t want to go out to a restaurant and look at the i can t like that s just not for me and it sounds like it s not for you either i think the root of it is maybe asking yourself and him how much of it is real and what he s and what is the depth of the check because i feel as though that would make me insecure in my relationship and maybe about myself a little bit too because you immediately go to the thought process of oh well if he thinks that s attractive and i don t look like that does he not think i m attractive and is he thinking about cheating on me which is obviously a similar thought process to what you re having and and that s why i mean like what is the depth of the checkout is he just does he appreciate human figure or is it he s actually shopping i think you have to have it sounds like you ve already confronted him because you said you have but i think you need to have an in depth conversation about it with him and tell him how it s affecting you or tell him what your deep rooted fears about him checking out other women are is it that you feel like he s going to cheat on you or that you re not attractive or that he has a different type than you and why does he feel the need to have to do it i mean because if he s doing it in front of her and also is he doing it all the time yeah and i also hate it i hate it i also don t like that he s like i ll try and hide it from you how i just don t A A do that my guy the A A i hate it it feels like it i hate if he can t if you can t reason with him through conversation to me it feels like a deal breaker i don t even feel like it s worth reasoning is that A A i don t feel like it s worth reasoning if it s bothering you it s bothering you and it s not okay and i don t want him to hide it from you i want him to never have done it and he s done it and it kind of feels like he s gon na keep doing it is what he s saying but hide it and all of that just makes me think like sayonara sucker he s she they ve been together for years yeah sayonara sucker well you know it s not that easy to say goodbye to our year relationship but maybe it is time to take inventory of the positives and negatives in your room okay then you guys have been together since you re i mean crazier and yeah i get that sayonara sucker you don t deserve that you don t deserve to have to ask him to hide his checkouts i agree and i would also do a check in with yourself of like what excites you about the relationship what does he do that does fulfill you and is this the very only thing that upsets you are you there because you re comfortable and you re afraid of change or are you there because you love him and life is worth being with him if you re there because it s easier to stay than go get gone i agree and if it really is isolated to this i would have a deep heart to heart with him talking about how it affects you and asking him to stop his behavior because i don t think it s right quite honestly yeah and you know at the end of the day if you don t like what you hear from him get a A A ginger hamster and name it lizzy oh okay well i hope we helped and thank you guys all for watching and enjoying and supporting our podcast uh if you want to follow us on social media we re at the sip official lizzy also has a vlog channel

with tits today oh i just have acne on my chest not your own i m saying you commented on two different breasts bosoms no i haven t on my own and that ladies are at the restaurant and then you showed me another example right i have talked about three sets of tits one of which being my own um i m not sending that to joe later i m also texting with my dad right now and i don t want to get those lines crossed she had like five series of events about her appearance right before we started rolling she goes i m wearing the kind of thing that you would make fun of and i said meat that i make fun of and she goes no that i make fun of and then two seconds later like a completely different person wow i m so hot i am so like those two can be the same like no matter what you re wearing look at me though i m wearing leggings A A workout shoes and a mini dress that i m going to take off the second we re done rolling because you can t see my bottom half but it s wack well we re filming two in a day because lizzy flew out to colorado two film podcasts which you re rallying strong honestly i commend you i m dying i don t know how you can do two a days in that airport oh uh it s because i like really want to go home like it s it s weird it s like a weird thing like i always love coming here and every time i m here i m like god i want to stay longer but then like in the back of my head it s like i miss my A A dogs and i do miss joe i get that i mean well not i m not missing joe specifically like i like joe but i m not like you know he s not my significant other but the puppy thing like i even go to my parents house for an hour i m like i got ta get home to her hailey because it s just like this bond where she does so many cute things and it s like i don t want to miss any of it and i just want to be with her at all times it s just like whenever i m not home i come home and it s like there s more destruction done to the cabinet in the kitchen where the puppy s been gnawing on it because i know they leave him in the kitchen with the gate locked or he s been eating the window in the front of the house so the window is just slowly eroding and yesterday joe had the audacity to like walk by the window that s like been the same amount of eaten since i ve gotten home because i m the only one who has like the dog on the couch with me all the time and joe goes wow that s gotten so much bigger today and it s like today you mean while i was out of town interesting choice of words they can t be trusted alone with animals loki they can not significant others in general no i can trust them they re just i can trust them oh no i m just saying for both of us like even i left today and it goes both ways like i can be equally as forgetful but i we were running out to lunch and i said oh we ve been doing riley s training sessions at lunch so instead of lunch he gets his food with his training she yeah that chewing a bone over there is pretty loud oh you can hear that well i m here too so i was like oh shane can you feed riley for lunch and he s like oh yeah feed and let out and i got home and i was like did you feed and let out riley and he like rolled his eyes at me and he s i m like what i m not allowed to ask and he goes no because that signifies that you don t trust that i did do it and i go well did she A A and he s the same thing happened and i was like well i just want to know for my own sake so that i m not taking her out aimlessly and being like oh she s not pooping and i know she needs to poop because if she s pooped then i m not going to sit out there praying that she ll poop how she pooped she pooped good for her also i was just so distracted while you were telling that story because this shirt is doing A A everything for your eyes really yeah it s a shirt i ve never worn before it s in the same cut that i always get shirts there s two different brands there s two different like brands within the same brand like there s two different oh it s a good material well this is the one i don t like because it s a really deep v and so i never actually wear the shirt but i really really have to go shopping for the podcast you got to get this color and everything well thank you because i was actually going to bring up that i need like i am in dire need of shopping for this podcast specifically because i did even see the last time we recorded i was straight from the gym and then a bunch happened and so i didn t change yeah and somebody said you need to retire that shirt and i m like i know it s been with me for four years and i wear it every day even though i have three and last week you wore a shirt from clever era which was at least like eight years ago right yeah and even just now i went to the closet and i m like i got ta change so that i m not wearing the same thing but i have nothing you only have the same thing also if i hadn t changed i would have totally forgotten that my id is in my titty so thank god back to dia that place A A sucks dia is what you re calling it denver international airport right baby girl oh that s what you wrote on the thing is the world s worst airport not me in the car being like let s die well because i was a just like at all with the way that you can hit two airport airplanes in one day i m in awe yeah what did i say oh is that okay with you i m just testing the waters i don t know you like to be corrected so i m just whoa now we re getting passive aggressive is that what that s called while you re beefing do you want to continue beefing or do you want me to talk about my qualms with the ia let s hear about dia first for those of you in the comment section you re like she never lets him finish his story this is miserable yeah i am miserable do you want to talk about that hole in your heart no oh well i mean i i mean because we need something deep well this is so funny because now two weeks in a row you want to talk about what i want to talk about in my vlog we ll save something for the podcast okay yeah no no i m like yeah let s plug this one make something sacred um no i m happy to talk about this is a repeat again a repeat a repeat a repeat of what your vlog and what whatever you re gon na say oh make it original wait first oh i get what you re saying first tell me about what you hate about dia besides the obvious what what s your diabetes okay what i love about lax we ll start with that nobody loves anything about lax you mean burbank i would i mean yes a small airport burbank is preferable i would do anything to fly out of burbank if possible but if you re going to a bigger airport i think los angeles lax is wonderfully set up because you get dropped off at your specific terminal and there s a security for every terminal like every different airline whereas at dia everyone going everywhere is in the same line oh and then they get on the trolley full of sardines into a trolley which i m positive every time i ve gotten covet has been in that trolley and i was just gon na tell you if i ever was gon na get covet it was going to be my last experience being packed into that trolley like a A A animal because we recently traveled to wyoming and we re on our way back we re trying to get home and we ve landed and i m just trying to get out of that A A airport yeah and we get down to the trolley but there s a million people waiting for it but everyone s running in and i m like i m not missing this because the next one s not for another five minutes and i can t be away from my house for longer than this and everyone i swear to you just everyone s like no we can fit more we can get more psychotic how they push in too it s like what the A A we re all holding on to each other i was like if i was ever gon na get a disease it was going to be in this confined space where there s people where the limit should be oh yeah and it s unavoidable and it s a nightmare and i just thought even on the way out on the way back in i just thought i never want to travel again out of this airport because it s such a freaking nightmare i mean i lost my luggage there like you don t have to tell me twice the dia sucks okay now that i m done with that because yeah flying out of burbank flying out of the small airport in wyoming yeah well burbank s just so chill i just liter i walk there from where i park my car i walk back to my car i m so pissed i bought a scooter and i completely forgot about it you haven t ridden it yeah you should be going to the grocery store you should go everywhere in that scooter it s not motor scooter oh do you still have those motor scooters yes i need to replace the wheel i moved it to this house and actually today on my walk my dog walk i m walking three dogs now which riley s still getting used to the antics of the leash i don t know if it s an answer anyway it s the right word it s maybe it s not it s not a horribly wrong word this smart lady might i add i couldn t do it with three dogs but she s on her electric scooter while her dog s running so that she can like exhaust them exhaust them get it out faster so she can get back to work or the rest of her day but it was real annoying for me because i have three dogs that are all worried about the dog and the scooter and they re all so it disrupted my walk it put like a one and a half minute pause on my already minute walk and by the end of my walk i ve been getting a little cranky oh weird you cranky my dog i took my dogs for a walk the other morning usually we ve been walking them at nighttime because it s so A A hot i ve got dog shamed i know yeah well you yeah so you get it we go at night time after the sun has sat so that this asphalt s not hella hot no yes and yeah i know you re not i googled that i was like dog shaming you didn t no but one of my neighbors did oh you don t remember what i mean i do i do and you were mad at me because i wasn t on your side yes i was walking on a dirt road they were fine there s natural grass everywhere my dad s also abusing his golden retriever by walking him in the daytime i m hot A A i just think like keep it to yourself it wasn t degrees outside don t comment on how i m caring i felt like i was being mom shamed um but i did google the temperature that it s because asphalt is like hot as A A it like doubles the rule is if you can t keep your hand on it they can t keep their pawn and i google the specific temperature that s agreed upon by most vets and it s degrees over you should not be walking your dogs fun fact so i ve been and i mean don t quote me on it but from my extensive research on google that is what i found i personally don t like to walk hotter than that anyways because it s not a fun experience for anyone it wasn t higher than that when i got dog shamed just saying it was close but it wasn t higher than that and i really couldn t let it go obviously it s been how long has it been like two months a long time it s been two months we ve even talked about it on the podcast like every time we ve met something happened to you except for last week maybe but then you talked about how fat honey is and you got fat shamed okay i ll stop we ll see my life is very interesting right now okay okay i don t have much going on anyways my dog stopped can i tell you something yeah anyways is not the actual word anyway yeah somebody in our comment section corrected the two of us saying they would prefer that it s anyway so why are you disregarding that correction because i don t care and so maybe i don t care about some of yours and that s fine but i m also pointing that out like just you got ta embrace it you got ta embrace who you are honey okay what were you talking about before i so rudely interrupted you oh i was just gon na say we saw a guy on a scooter the other day on our walk okay but the dogs were just like stunned they just they were like like if jelly had been there she would have like chased that A A down and like what the A A are you you know what i mean she d be like daddy were you working more like whatever it was that s always jelly s vibe to protect um but the the two boys just stopped and they re like what is that i watched it go all the way down the street back to his house i was like guys we got ta go and that s what i mean it really put like a two to five minute stop in my walk well i ve also started letting them do whatever the A A they want on the walk like sniffing whatever which isn t great for like leash etiquette but i m like is leash etiquette for them or me and it feels like it s for me honestly yeah it does feel selfish to the human and so it s like this what do they A A live for this walk like let them have this walk man and i try to do a happy mixture where it s like okay we re gon na really smell everything right now and then we re gon na do minutes of just walking yeah because i also read that the smelling is what knocks them out like it makes them sleepy oh cause it makes their well both of them it makes their brains think they re thinking about the smell that they re smelling but if it s just a walk it s gon na take me twice as long to exhaust these A A so you re just like smell everything yeah or twice as far but i m just like yeah get your sniffs in but then the other thing is like the baby doesn t have this flu shot yet so i m like don t sniff the pb blue yeah i m giving them flu shots because i m taking the baby to training i didn t know is that like the board or the the one that no that s that one this is a flu shot okay the vet told me i had every shot i could have for my dog so i hope that she s right i mean it probably is it s specifically like we didn t do it last year and i m starting to think when jelly was very sick at the beginning of the year that was the flu oh because joe kept saying like it s like she s really really sick like she just has some like a like a sickness instead of it being about her cancer or pancreatitis or an ulcer or anything and he s like right because the it s i don t want to get into it it s gross it turns into vomit talk i think we we re going to talk about the deep hole in your um being oh i mean that came before the trauma i was born with a hole in my heart okay so elaborate oh my god we were going to talk about everything i said at lunch yeah i think it s good did it deep okay what do you like what do you want me to extrapolate so basically i was talking about as i do in my vlog this week you can t take this from me i ve pre planned it okay as long as you sell me a story right now then we re fine basically i was just talking about how there s like um you know last week s vlog is all about gratitude and i noticed that a lot of the comments in my comment section are about people s gratitude for their you know sobriety however long it may be and i you we were just talking about like what sobriety is for me because it s not just not drinking and using it s also working on filling the hole in my heart and i call it a hole in my heart because it s like i was born with a deficit or like a deficiency and it s the and that s what i think of like and it s not depression it s i think some people could could diagnose it as depression i think some people could diagnose it as anxiety and adhd would you say what s the overlining feeling though is that that you ll never be satisfied prior to it s thought prior to treating it s i am undeserving of love and life wow and i think that that is indicative of my alcoholism but it s not just alcohol that s my problem because it s also like i told you at lunch like i just have a big problem everything i do i want to do it big right and i will do it big because it s like once i step one foot out of my mental sobriety and i pick up something that i quote unquote use be it a credit card be it alcohol be it marijuana be it pills whatever the A A that one pickup is the last choice i can make consciously because you were saying as you got older you realize that you can fill or mask some of the hole with substances i have a really stupid analogy okay i m ready have you ever noticed on instagram reels or tik tok when they have those videos of like a jalapeno that s got a bite taken out of it and then they fill like the jalapeno with top of ramen noodles and then they file down the top ramen noodles and then they put glue in the top of ramen noodles oh first they put glue then they file down the noodles and then they paint it to make it look like the jalapeno and never had a bite taken out of it but you know it s filled with ramen noodles so it s not actually whole i wish i could relate but i just described it in great detail can you not can you make eggnog and he just i blacked out at the fact that i had never seen the visual A A i was like i m so upset that i ve never seen this visual but i m kind of with you yeah are you anyways for those of you who did listen at home that s kind of what it is like i can i with alcohol with weed with drugs with money with whatever the A A with negative behavior negative attention i can patch the hole but it still exists so once uh like the only good thing about removing those substances is now i have a proper wound to treat instead of one that s gon na get infected you re forced to face what the wound is initially and you can actually heal it and what were i mean you don t have to elaborate if you don t want but what were some of your findings like what were some of your revelations when you were getting sober that you needed to work upon i think the biggest revelation the biggest revelation this is also funny at lunch i kept saying we were talking about how we argue with people and lizzy said i ve come to a conclusion that if i can t uh if i pause think about it and then can t explain what my problem is in two words then it it s not worth it and i need to let it go and so i said what was my question you said like what s like what can you express the two words and i said important things and you said but what is that and i said he s like but what with two words can you do that i was like well i just did it with two words important things and i said well there s not one fight in my life that i could take a pause from and say two words that would like paint the picture of while i m still mad except like i m frustrated but then that still doesn t do it but then i asked her a like very specific question and she kept repeating my question in her answer as if it was an interview like i m like what specifically hurt you the most and she s like the thing that specifically hurt me the most i m a well trained girl my mom s an english teacher i m ready to answer essay questions i didn t know that i mean kind of what does kind of an english teacher mean i mean i like honestly mom no offense i don t really know my mom s a special lady anyways one of the things i actually learned was that um the uh you know how like it s so easy for me to hate things and people and sometimes it seems absurd how much i hate that person or thing or obsess about it yeah that so that is because i don t i like my foundation is i don t deserve to be loved so i get really and i guess the most appropriate word is jealous and then punitive to people who act as if they re worthy of love right and to me the simple act of the confidence to exist and express oneself freely is indicative of someone believing they re worthy of love and i m just like A A that and A A you because you don t and that s A A and so what has helped you overcome that phase this is the one that i have to work on the most regularly is because it s so that s the word it s so ingrained because it s something i was it was a it was a born with feeling so to get rid of that it takes like constant um belief in uh the fact that i am lovable right and the fact that love isn t something that you know people are or are not worthy of it just is yeah like people are just loved people are just love so embracing that and understanding that and accepting that helps a lot but i really need the constant reminder which is like why i go to places as regularly as i can where their motto is we will love you until you love yourself oh that is one of the mottos i mean that s i don t think it s a slogan written on a A A card hanging in a church but it s a point that s hit frequently it s something that s said a lot okay and you don t understand it or you roll your eyes at it at first and then like if you keep coming back eventually the the truth of that statement settles into that hole in my heart and it s like maybe i don t hate little xan maybe i just hate myself so let s relate this to julia fox that s different she s not deserving whoa you can t be a realized person i m kidding i know and that s why we love you that was a joke i don t hate julia fox oh i know you just i find rage i hate what she s doing i don t even know that i hate what she s doing like i hate little zan but like i don t i don t even know which one that is it s diego it s one of tiana mojo s exes oh he s the one that s got the tattoos all over his face again i realize that s a non unique trait but um yeah not a big fan of lausanne wow but i guess he s deserving of love too because we all are because no one deserves it we just hour and a half you know seems like you re treated i m cured someone said that i said that the other day this guy was like i haven t seen you around it s like oh i figured it out he s like like that s the most toxic thing i could say in one of these rooms by the way like i was totally joking i was like no i m good i m good i m cured forever cured i just took steps now i m good wow and i don t know if we ve already talked about this but do you not have urges just to because like me even after a long day even if it wasn t stressful like sometimes i just crave a glass of wine even like the smell of it the aroma it s like a coffee to me i miss the ritual and inclusion with groups but that s why i do shots of energy drinks right to be part of the rituals sorry i m laughing i know no that s like yeah yeah but it s like i i honestly like i really miss the ritual and the and the community but then i see my community when they re not doing shots of red bull but shots of hard alcohol and i m like i don t miss that no i don t miss that at all yeah um i don t miss the anxiety and depression that s guaranteed to come after sometimes even during i don t miss that at all yeah i definitely miss molly all the time i wish i was a normal person i ve never done that gosh i really wish i was a normal person and could do molly every day because normal people do drugs every day and sometimes like i miss like do you remember when you re like in high school and you first start smoking weed and you just do it like once every year maybe like i miss the thrill of that one time you get high but it s like i can t just get high one time and it s annoying because everyone s like marijuana is not addictive it s like girl i m addicted i know so many people addicted to marijuana but it s like i m addicted to A A everything i m addicted to gluten even though it A A my body up riley right it s not a cheap toy she s eating the tripod baby riley finn now she s stopped cause she knows she s in trouble she knows oh my sweet little gorgeous princess your little foot head baby okay so do you want to talk about while you re heavily grounded i think you should touch upon your recognization you re wrecking oh well let s leave that ground are you just trying to avoid the beef i have with you for the A A A A whichever story you want to start i just want to really quickly while i m sitting here super vulnerable and grounded with you let you know that i have a resentment against you i should have never told you this you really shouldn t have it was an insane thing for you to do and it s like the way you looked at me when you said it was like you wanted a fight you know what i mean but it was weird because you did it off camera so it felt really personal like you didn t bring it here to like start some A A it was like you did it in our real life mm hmm well no i mean it was truthful we get dr phil on the line i swear to god i m like looking at what was i looking at oh i needed to tell you what the uber costing but i was looking at it i can t i m still haven t looked at the ober i was looking at crumble cookies and this week they seem to be like cake themed or like whatever it doesn t matter i would like to try them this week he goes oh i had them but i left them at my mom s house because i didn t want you to have any of them well no in real time it was my sister s birthday yesterday and so we went over to celebrate so shane got the big party box and it is uh frequent it when i m thinking about the like the truth when i m thinking about the extended about the truth it really does break my heart for you from me like bad me uh because you do once a week like say like have you seen the crumble flavors did you try them are they worth it which one s worth it should i try it like that s something you frequently ask me well it s because in la it s either like i pay in time spent to go get them or i pay extra for a delivery and it s like is it worth that or are these going to sit and rot on my counter and last week s totally worth it everyone was out of damn home run i feel like you just we didn t respond to my time last week this weeks were i wouldn t none of them were great to me we have a reverse taste in them because it s crazy love that animal cracker every time that lizzie likes one shane and i hate it yeah we re except for shane and i on the sugar cookie yeah if there s anything remotely sugar cookie about one i text shane and i m like listen you should probably try this one so that s like the extent of my relationship with shane to some degree have you tried this crumble cookie will you read my script Laughter can i steal this A A from you thank you we can t have them around the house because we like to get them once a week to try the flavors and then like send them to my family or get rid of them but we can t bring them back home because then we re just gon na end up eating them because they re all it makes me sick it makes me sick too and that s the thing is every time i eat with lizzy she eats to a point where she tells me how sick she is for three hours afterwards and so i just thought even because my mom goes you should take each flavor for lizzy and i was like she s gon na eat all of them and then she s gon na be sick and then she s not gon na be able to perform on the podcast and i told lizzy that verbatim and i just watched her heart break i was devastated but it was rude i should have got that just that it was thought of and it doesn t matter cause i m already sick to my stomach right now and i couldn t even tell you why well we went and got fried pickles for lunch yeah but i i literally from the beginning of my day to now i have made a very conscious effort to not A A with any gluten because i m sick of it and it did say the fried pickles were gluten free and vegan which is so special right like so is all this sauce gluten free because we left there i showed you my belly she did in public it s like wild in public wild no i m not i bet there s videos we could probably search your name on tick tock and find videos and you re screaming obscenities in your house like how much i would love that if you could find that of me i know you would and that brings us to a good segue well i just wanted to say when you you just told me you were perplexed about not being able to find your uber charge and so today she was like trying to pay for half the lunch and i was like oh it s fine and she s like oh no i will and i said just minus it from your uber and i ll oh so it s just one transaction she goes and i was like okay just pay for lunch i figured out how to venmo you for the lunch i thought you were trying i know i just thought it was funny like you know the editing yeah don t ask me how to do math it s literally this okay now into your segue i m sorry what i did was not worth taking over the segway no i i do think it s funny but it s one of those moments that s like better in person you know yeah most of our things are which is why we re making a movie our podcast is so great we re better in person everything s better in person all right hit up well hold on let me see anything else okay this is fine we can come back for the other things because it is just such an appropriate segue right so i was um and in in this last vlog i was at a bachelorette party in vegas and we go to costco at first and none of us really know each other and i have a hole in my heart and sometimes it s filled by being an A A and one of the assholey things i was like it s like you know because i say this to you all the time and it s like honestly i am joking but i m also not joking like i m a little joking but it s like i m not joking about what if i don t like i ll i ll say sometimes to someone like quietly like if i do not get recognized i m gon na A A leave what do you guys want anything from starbucks no thank you i m okay thank you um so i ll say that and i ll be joking and then if it does end up happening i feel really awkward and bad because i i feel really awkward and nervous and weird because i m we i m a broken person i don t know what you want from cheers and it can t be filled with recognition um or can it no it can t but i was like like i was joking with joe the whole time like i better get recognized in front of these A A like oh for nothing you know what i mean i m just being psychotic you know if you re here you know i m out of my A A mind and so i d been saying that the whole time and like just being absurd and then in costco it s like what happens to you in public it was wild someone screamed my name and i just turned and looked thinking it was one of the girls because i was alone we had all dispersed and gone about the costco to get the A A that we wanted so i was by myself and i hear someone shout lizzy and so i look thinking it s one of the girls and someone goes i was right that s lizzy from the sip and i went i ve been recognized and when we walked in the cop into the costco like as a group of A A i was like i just hope i don t get recognized here like was joking and then it happened and i was alone and i was like do i tell them oh it cut out today s podcast is sponsored by calm and you know how it goes your day is filled

week s vlog anyways oh okay joe watches joe s like the biggest supporter of my vlog never seen the podcast but well he s seen an episode that was enough for him i did ruin it i ruined our chances mitchell so anyways i like my first thought was do i tell them like do i tell the girls i ve been recognized in my mind i can envision you being like can you do that one more time when all my friends come you know i ve done that right mr bubbs got recognized at a museum one time and this guy goes your dog looks a lot like mr bubsico he is mr bubs and he went oh my god that s awesome and then i went this is gon na sound crazy um would you be willing to do that again but let me film it it was like what i was like well see i do this thing where i call it vlogging and i was just wondering if you could just say exactly the beats that you just said again as if it were your first time but do it while i m filming and he let me and it s in one of my vlogs but yes i do do that joe said it doesn t count if you have to tell people it happened and then i told them but they thought i was doing a bit and so it was all just super demoralizing but i just wound up checking joe and i was like well i did tell them and they think i m joking and i m not joking and so it just looks extra bad there s no recovering from this like i m just such a A A A A and i can t stop it s like once i start going down the hill of being an A A it s like a gain oh yeah you know you know you were all here we all know i don t mean any of it which is why i can laugh and then sometimes i catch someone who like doesn t know i m joking and i m like oh this makes me want to yeah if i didn t know you i wouldn t know half the time that s why i can t go through like a line ordering food situation with chipotle sweet greens i would never go to puzzle anyways okay it s trash it s disgusting makes me sick i can t do the meat from like any of those places especially the chicken because they re all thighs and the thighs makes me really think about the chicken and then like it s just a different taste about it A A sick i don t trust chicken quite frankly it makes me like like i don t like it but i did eat all the chicken on the salad today because i was ready to get hungry when i got to the airport it was a delicious salad i just dropped my mouth okay um so in the last episode i don t know how we got to wiki pages i don t remember chris pratt chris pratt if you missed it oh you thought i was saying someone said nasty A A on your wiki page yes because you targeted it at me no i just i speak about like the proverbial you um okay as in one so we thought do we even have that i m sure you did i thought it could be fun to google live i m using my phone as so we can use my phone but i just want to be very clear i don t have high hopes for having a wiki page and it is already devastating to the point where like my ears are ringing and i feel bad about myself what did he say to your tit pic yes i took this for you he said the sexiest wow he said loved your grateful model you re a grateful montage oh that is cute he goes i said i live for you anyways all right do i have a wiki what are you

air host and producer for clever an online pop culture media company boring boring boring is it yeah oh this is boring well i think it shows that you re a self starter adam s entered into a relationship with fellow youtuber and also clickable shane dawson in as of february his videos oh dark that s dark what as of february his videos average million views what is dark about that that now it s nowhere close to that oh is that dark you re perfect huge numbers um okay born oh it says i was born in denver colorado hop fact i was born in youtube you don t even know him they have my

alongside his co host lizzie gordon that s me okay did you want to talk about the woodstock show before we get into advice do you want to see the one wiki i am on i am on a wiki page oh a feet no but i m on that too i m on a wiki page called awful movie wiki no yes i am and is was it a movie you wrote it s a movie i wrote produced and starred in that joe directed and it just talks about how bad the movie is yeah it s kind of funny it s nice being on a page you know remember i was talking a few episodes back about how toxic it is when people thrive even on negative attention no when did you say that what was the point i m like they re blinded by the attention that even if it s negative it s fine what i m not on awful movie wiki the movie is and so i m basically just a byproduct of the movie the writer and the star isn t even a part no wow god that s upsetting moving on the film stars lizzie gordon who s also the writer is that it why it sucks Laughter the trivia question is lizzie gordon my name is spelled wrong lazy ie gordon who why why does it suck you can t just skip over the hottest part okay i mean there s a lot of points there s points to why this there s reasons why um what s the movie called so everyone can watch it i don t want them to watch it no can i tell you why i don t want people to watch it sorry because i was financially abused in the making of this film the production company that made it didn t pay me appropriately and they never paid joe what he was owed and agreed to and on top of that they make money every time you watch it legally so if you are gon na watch this dumpster fire piece of A A awful movie steal it or you re paying my abuser i m not laughing at the paying your abuser i m laughing that you re telling people to steal something steal it but also like just don t even watch it it s such a flaming piece of A A it s hard to watch like the producer who made it prize on the passion and dreams of young people in los angeles trying to make their way in this world and he will take hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors who are also actors who think that they re going to be in a movie that s going to launch their career but then he steals that money for himself to pay for drugs and alcohol and prostitution that makes a really low budget shitty movie makes a really low budget shitty movie and then pays back the investors once they sell which they don t sell for much but they do sell for a little bit and he pays them back with the money from the next project so it s like a ponzi scheme where he s constantly scamming people and continues to work but he worked himself out of la i think he s in chicago now whoa yeah anyways steal the A A movie don t pay for it it will never not surprise me the links that cons can go also this is like genres this is an exhausting con like there are better ways to steal money this guy s teeth are rotting out of his head and his pants are constantly covered doesn t matter like he s working himself to the bone not making good movies and honestly like working pretty hard if he is like on a lot of drugs working really hard for being a person who s trying to be a thief but the trivia part lizzie gordon spelled wrong who plays the protagonist ashley and is the film s writer as the god daughter of academy award winning actress helen hunt i mean you re climbing your way there i think it s so funny i think it s so funny anyways anyways um okay what did you have about woodstock it s woodstock my brother was talking about this last night so he watched the documentary yeah i have not yet dabbled should we wait until we ve both seen it or do you want it in line i mean we can but by the time you do like it ll then five years yeah and i won t remember it if they don t talk about it the week i want yeah i mean i also texted you multiple times and was like watch the victoria s secret documentary i tried and we re like go A A yourself that s why we watch those things i tried i was right where you re sitting and five minutes in and then i was like guess it wasn t i honestly did the same which is why i never brought it up again but the woodstock documentary um stayed awake during woodstock now well it s a great it s a really well edited piece honestly it kind of reminded me a little bit of how like good shane is and and evoking emotions from a person watching one of his series this thing was really good at keeping you on like in it like i was editing while i was watching it and i kept finding myself getting lost in it and i had headphones on you know what i mean like so i kept getting lost in it and um it was just so interesting to listen to the perspective of the people who threw it because it was a monster A A show and also i remember woodstock constantly being like the punch line of jokes i don t know much about it at all so the original woodstock was like a free love peace whatever movement music festival a lot coachella but like of their time nitty gritty dirty people were camping out forever so many people showed up it was like worse than tanacon like i m just saying it in relatable terms for you right no thank you so it s and it s like raining and there s like mudslides and it s A A gross but like you know jimmy hendrix is wheeling on the guitar and it s like a whole A A yeah it s a whole A A moment of a collective group of people of the time doing something that nobody thought you could ever A A do and it was gnarly so in a few people want to recreate it and the first thing that they do wrong is they capitalize the food and beverage part of it so already it s like a mainstream sellout thing when they re they have all these bands coming in like corn and olympics biscuit which is like you know let s rage against the machine type of A A they re using the marketing of what was this amazing one of a kind event and some of the people behind that like that behind this movement were of the original woodstock right and so it s like the same emotions to it but it s like no matter what like in fire festival which i still pronounce this fryer festival because i m a A A idiot it s a huge investment and you need to pay back your investors yeah so they re like oh the way that we ll do that is by charging people for food and water so initially like instantly coca cola became the people behind it wow which is a major sellout move for like a vibe like that the second thing that was A A wild is the people that could afford these tickets and who were down to come to this show were like dudes in college in it s a whole A A different elk like they re a different kind of guy like kid rock is their god and it s like i get that because kid rock is my god too the difference is i m not safe in that crowd in which was shown in this documentary where all these women who are like showing their tits and A A are getting horribly groped while they re thrown through the the you know like how you can crowd surf and it s supposed to be like a fun A A empowering thing these women felt so empowered on the first day of the festival that they were walking around naked fearlessly which i think is great that s A A awesome at a co ed event to have that kind of comfort that to have that kind of free like vibe whatever and then to have that go so darkly and twistedly south like cheryl crow was performing and everyone just kept screaming at her show your tits and it s like i ve been known to scream show your tits but it s like it s a facetious thing i don t need it i don t mean it and i m saying it because of how horrific it was back whatever so that s horrible then it goes from bad to worse nobody could afford food or water because it was so expensive so they re all getting really A A irritated the whole weekend and they re just on drugs and drink and have no water to drink except for the free public water which by day two had become infested with feces yuck so by day three A A were getting trench mouth did they have footage from the time oh wow it s okay did we have cell phones then it was covered by mtv oh wow mtv had correspondence there like what s his name from live trl oh carson daly carson daly was covering it and it s A A wild these people were like the next day my throat hurt i couldn t swallow i had huge sores all over my mouth that s trench mouth it s A A sick so the other thing is like you know corn unicorns heavy like they go they go hard like james had corn in the car the other day and i had to like stop him i was like it s too much i was like it is nine o clock in the morning what s going on and what the A A is this because it s like i ve heard mainstream corn but i ve never heard like deep corn and i didn t know i don t think i have dude actually when we re done with this i m gon na have to play you the song because the fact that it was out of the car i was like this has to be something like super underground because it s so A A gnarly it s so A A gnarly anyways corn comes on and the crowd goes A A ape A A and it s like violent and crazy and like people are like beating the A A out of each other in the mosh pits and like screaming like gnarly security guards were like it was weird like at one point everybody would be here and then in the blink of an eye they d move six feet as a communal group of like people like that s how hard the crowd was going and um you know it just escalates off that and turns into this horrible A A up thing there was a rave room where like dj fat slim don t look at me for facts fat slim so where does this live it lives on netflix but it gets so A A gnarly to the point where on the last night red hot chili peppers are playing a song which is um god they they did it in wayne s world too i can t remember but cassandra does a cover of this jimi hendrix song about and there s the word fire in it stan staying next to mfa it s nothing like what i m doing right now and it s i don t think it s come on maybe light my fire either um i ll think of it in the second we stopped recording and it s so unimportant to the rest of the story okay the point the point being there was fire it was jimmy these people were all given lit candles as a unifying sort of tribute to gun violence and that was not cleared by the fire marshal but then all these people when this jimi hendrix song comes on starts lighting fires in trash cans that turn into huge huge out of control fires and the firemen were like we re not going in there these people have been batshit crazy for three days they re starving they re on drugs they re thirsty they ve got trench mouth i m not going in there to fight that fire with maniacs which i get and so what happened it burned up propane tanks exploded how many people died honestly i m not sure any died whoa but that s a great question and are you finished with it is it a series is it a movie is it a documentary it s a documentary series so how many episodes i don t know it was on all day though this is like i was doing other things because do you ever watch tv undistracted yeah when it s A A i care about emily in paris hell yeah not kidding how sad is that i hate watch it with every fiber of my baby that s what uncoupled was for me with neil patrick harris it s this is so A A funny a year old man with a pre existing heart condition was the only man that passed away maybe netflix new three part documentary series train wreck woodstock remembers the chaos that ensued at the attempted revival of the woodstock music festival instead of the the festival s original promise of peace and love the rendition resulted in riots arson and death nearly people attended whoa which was just about miles uh from the original site limp biscuit was there dude honestly this one of the most like sort of like um emotionally engaging things of this documentary series for me was the nostalgia for these bands because i love that A A like there s nothing that i love more than a A A angry A A screaming like oh i love it so much i love it so much it s toxic so that was fun because i i if i had been a man at the time i would have had a great time at woodstock i would have had a really A A good time woodstock but then when i brought it up to joe and james who were of age to be there at that time they were like even then it seemed like a weird stupid sellout thing like that nobody really wanted to go to so the vibe of the documentary series seemed off to them i can t speak to it because i was nine but it s the way he leads through the background all right let s get into some advice though are you sure it s time yeah okay you should go for it i ve read so much today what have you been reading i read our wiki delayed i m terrified that it might be i don t know how to check my updates though your gate has changed oh all right hi girlies i m a year old that still lives with her parents i ve been in my first local relationship for about nine months and he s honestly been the best and most respectful person the problem is their relationship with my parents they re very religious and now and have now given me several talks about not having sex and to be cautious about the type of things i wear like shorts i find it a bit extreme on their part especially because they ve recently prohibited me from going to his house as we d be alone and it could be a moment of quote weakness they claim to be supportive of our relationship but have talked A A since we started dating all because he s not religious luckily my boyfriend has been very patient with my parents but it hurts to feel like they won t have a positive relationship if me and him are going for the long term i ve always had to choose between my happiness versus making my parents happy and this has all been very frustrating hope this made sense any advice really helps love you guys i wish that her parents happiness was uh a product of hers yes and i m not a parent so i don t know how hard that would be if my all of my core beliefs felt misrepresented in my child s choice but at the end of the day i do feel it s necessary to find a way to take yourself out of your child s happiness but that doesn t help her that s advice for her parents yeah do you have their number do you want to send us their number i m happy to give them a call i m on a weird like power trip right now and i would love to just be like listen guys like i love that you have this love for your religion and your daughter and you want the best for her but sometimes what s best for her is is you actually wanting what s best for her yeah i mean religion sexuality a lot of those things even if you have expectations of your kid being a football player a baseball player and they have interest in arts or drama or swimming it i did always um well now i really applaud my parents for encouraging me in whatever direction i wanted like i did gymnastics for a long time to the point where i was about to do traveling like going be on the team that travels and my dad was always like yeah go for it this is great he d go to practice he dropped me off for practice never questioned like how A A gay that was stop it s not that gay no another straight gymnast i m just saying it for myself you know but uh i mean i think that will be very challenging as a parent as we come into if my daughter brings home a dick wiggler it s going to be hard see we all have our things it s going to be hard i don t even care if he s more rich and famous and successful than i will ever even dream to be you don t care if he s offering to buy you a house if it s little honey i would be like all right please don t touch her so as the child well as this woman that s writing in not child child of her parents what advice do you have for her though the bummer is my advice is to be what they are struggling to be it s to exemplify how it s the golden rule you treat others how you want to be treated regardless of how they treat you you and it s hard like i m literally telling you this as a person who s not in your position so it s really A A easy for me to say this but from if i were i would hope that if i were in your position i would have patience and understanding and love for them because it sounds like you do love them because you re willing to sacrifice your own happiness for theirs and that s a huge thing for someone to do so i have to assume you love them so continuing to love them have understanding for their religious perspective and patience while you treat yourself with the same love and respect for what brings you happiness mom and dad i love you and i love my boyfriend they don t have to coexist and their their religious persecution does not have to be your business and i understand that it s nearly impossible to divorce the two while living in the house and hearing what they re saying but it s just like what i was trying to tell you at lunch like if there s not something i can do to rectify the situation with two words it means i m trying to control something that is out of my control forever right i can not control people places or things and sometimes like you were saying we were talking about it in regards to fighting with anyone and you were saying well some things just need to be let go to let go of some things and move on and i was like i don t know if that s true because like what if i m not done being angry about the thing that i m holding on to and you were like not valid and i was like well i think it depends on the circumstance i also think that s a deeply masculine character why why because i ve heard a lot of men say that and i ve noticed because i m a fighter so i fight with a lot of people and i ve noticed that more often than not when i m fighting with a man he cares about the specific details of the argument as opposed to the overarching umbrella theme issue which is most commonly boiled down to i m hurt you re hurt we re hurting each other and that and you can simplify it like that but it s like i do think like bringing up an old wound over time constantly and always going back to that isn t going to help you so i agree like creating a solution for the overarching problem is the best way to go but if you re not there yet it s hard to close that chapter if you re still being hurt in the same way i totally get it i m not sure if this is a perfect analogy but it s like if i shoot you with the gun there s a couple of problems right specifically there s a hole in you but in order to fix that hole in you we really got to focus on me just like stopping shooting you great because we can uh you know we can deal with this hole in you and i can shoot you again and you re gon na have a new hole do you see what i m saying so the specifics of the holes are less important and the more important thing is stop the pattern of me shooting you okay do you see what i m saying yes and that s all that s my that s my and i guess it to me it depends on the gravity of the situation like if you were cheated on that seems like oh that s that s something that s connected with two words there are we re done okay back to you i know you re it would be the worst dude i m so sorry A A that A A though honestly i know that it sucks ass living with your parents you know what i think if you are financially capable i think it might be best for you to start your own journey even if it s very even if it s only a mile from your parents having your own space to create your own life because is not a child and i think ideally you come together with your parents because obviously it sounds like you love them and the idea is that everyone gathers and has a wonderful time because there s nothing better than having your parents get along well with your significant other but i think if you kind of detached a little bit from the daily stresses of feeling the weight of their religion on your life that might be a good solution for now there s also i don t know if this pertains to you because you didn t specifically say your this is your problem but later in life i learned about this world or later in my young life i learned about the word enmeshment where you can become as a child enmeshed with your parent which means that your feelings are seemingly predicated upon your parents feelings and because of that you become sort of codependently enmeshed in your parental relationship and it has sort of an emotionally stunting effect on a person it keeps you like a child mindfully for too long and a supporting a subordinate for too long so it s really important that you um find the mindfulness to deconnect your cord from them so that you can be your own person and evolve into your own adulthood and you can have all that and still love them yeah and i think constantly over time if you show them that you re in a loving relationship they re going to come to terms with oh maybe he s not the same religion that we had hoped for but he s giving my daughter everything emotionally and like he is a good man i think over time they will come to terms with what actually is and if they never do i and if he s the one and you re with him forever i strongly encourage you to um come to find a way to protect your joy and your space mentally without needing to control your parents because you can not do that you can not change your parents minds you can not do anything that the and they may change on on of their own will and volition nothing you do is going to change that so if i were you i would focus your time and energy mentally on accepting them as they are and embracing and celebrating your individuality and your relationship with this guy who s good to you amen okay we got an update from a previous submission update hey there not sure if anyone does updates for am i the A A so i m the gal that wrote in about two or three months ago regarding my wicked sisters and them selling my mother s house after school i m so glad you reached out so i took your advice thank you and i asked my sisters for a meeting they refused and sent a sheriff to my house one week later to kick me out they gave me days notice and then changed the locks on the doors after i moved out so i will not be buying the house for sure now i decided lizzy is right they are wicked sisters and i have said A A it i found a new place to rent i said a heart wrenching goodbye to my dogs and moved out a couple of days ago since i felt like i was on a roll with getting toxic people out of my life i decided to end my seven year relationship he was toxic as A A too i made the decision to A A them all i chose me maybe i can mourn properly and heal my mind in heart thank you so much you have no idea how much your advice helped and then sorry uno is barking i m crying she says p s i m a bit lonely uh maybe a hamster named sippy oh i just realized sippy s because of our sip show yeah that s beautiful dude i m so sorry A A all of that A A all of that so hard and i m proud of you yeah i mean i can t imagine the strength it took for you to be able to stand up for yourself and thank you for writing back and giving us the update i do think within your new life you re going to find blessings that you had never expected because in ways of having and being able to keep that house you would have fond memories and um be in a space you re familiar with i do think going to a new space creating a new environment for yourself and starting over is going to bring you things that you never expected yeah i m not i got ta say like i got chills all over my body and my eyes filled with tears and i m A A sorry i m hella proud of you because i know that s really hard i ve been blessed in the past where the people that i don t want in my life when they get a sense of me building a self esteem and a boundary it s like they respond like a vampire to garlic and they fizzle off on their own so i ve never had to have the courage to be like A A off but it s uh especially when it s your sister s and your relationship of a long time yo send us pictures of the hamster honestly so cute i love that they re great pets i m wishing you the best though and i hope uh your new life is filled with everything you ve imagined even if it hurts right now i think building something new and that is completely you and discovering who you without all of these things are will be incredible yeah it s like uh you know how like grocery stores have to do an inventory and throw away rotten A A you took an inventory you threw away the rotten A A your shelves are clear right now for some good ass stuff and i m excited for your next chapter that comes after this period of grieving because i know that that s really A A hard and i uh can tell you that there are glimpses like cuz i m sad as A A i m always like don t do it like stay like hold on to everything like a tornado s coming like you can control the tornado but it s like to be completely honest like there are glimmers of like me having a feeling of like oh today s beautiful oh i love my life granted immediately after i have that thought i get back into my like morning thoughts but it s just to even have that hope of that and then to find a way to find the balance of grief and new at the same time i think will come and it might be a slow build it might be really hard for a while and have patience i think it s going to be ultimately worth it and i think looking back in a couple of years you re not going to imagine what your life would have been like had you been in the same space how did you always were had you continued to waste your time with rotten food also i m gon na pitch that you get a ginger hamster and it is about me oh my god what i didn t announce my babies oh since we last spoke i ve had two more babies and all of my girls are in this world now all your everyone that was pregnant has popped them out how many are there now there s uh gosh i don t i don t know if i m allowed to say all their names oh there s uh millie lily cody and ellie okay four mm hmm wow oh no like no and hayden i m one boy hayden it s kind of like you sending me like seven pictures a day of your dog i think everyone s happy for everyone to have a baby but the people that like don t know any of these people i don t know that they i have absolutely super emotional these human babies are like the french bulldogs of humans like they are so goddamn cute and perfect what everyone thinks their babies are perfect no these aren t my babies they re adorable though like they re honestly so A A cute okay the one boy hayden is my friend cynthia s kid and he s barely even a larva pup but that dude smiles and listens like are you A A kidding me and mills was born with a head full of hair her real name s milani but i m calling her mills i m playing with millie but i think mills is good like mills and lilz you know what i m saying all right last one before we go hello ryland and lizzy and chris i m and i ve been with my boyfriend for years we live together and i love him so much but a problem that i ve had a lot is that i always catch him looking at other girls while we re out together i told him how much it kills me and he has had and he has made it less obvious when it when he looks but i still catch him doing it he claims he never looks i just want to know if i have a right to feel upset should i not care do i confront him again when he s doing it i m a cancer so am i just being too sensitive i hope you guys can help me out gosh i don t know if he s really doing that that s really upsetting Music yeah i think i would feel yeah it s hard not to feel offended by that especially if you re experiencing it in real time i was trying to relate it to porn but it s like a real life scenario that you re witnessing in real time of a person that s tangible yeah rather than like somebody behind a screen i wonder how much is it s hard to know like i guess in your gut you know what is him checking out another person rather than just like casually looking at people that are going by yeah i um i don t know like i was talking about this with my friend sarah because i m particularly like nope you know what i mean in regards to what i was trying to tell sarah that if i had been i i would not be a pers i would not be comfortable at all being touched by one of the male dancers at thunder down under oh i would be very upset about it i would feel like it was cheating and not cool and that s at a dance show yeah um and she said you know other people have different relationships and um you know she there are some people who have the security within their relationship to be polyamorous there are people who have the com like the kind of relationship where they can say to each other like i have a crush on this person at work and i want to A A them i you know i have friends who have rules about their open relationship where they re allowed to step out and sleep with whoever they want as long as it doesn t come home like things like that and it s just that is not me a lot of gay guys i know will even like go to restaurants or bars and talk about all the hot guys they saw there together and be like oh that restaurant always attracts hot guys and i m like if i ever heard shane talking like that it would really make my stomach turn yeah and that s not like what i m looking to do with him like i don t want to go out to a restaurant and look at the i can t like that s just not for me and it sounds like it s not for you either i think the root of it is maybe asking yourself and him how much of it is real and what he s and what is the depth of the check because i feel as though that would make me insecure in my relationship and maybe about myself a little bit too because you immediately go to the thought process of oh well if he thinks that s attractive and i don t look like that does he not think i m attractive and is he thinking about cheating on me which is obviously a similar thought process to what you re having and and that s why i mean like what is the depth of the checkout is he just does he appreciate human figure or is it he s actually shopping i think you have to have it sounds like you ve already confronted him because you said you have but i think you need to have an in depth conversation about it with him and tell him how it s affecting you or tell him what your deep rooted fears about him checking out other women are is it that you feel like he s going to cheat on you or that you re not attractive or that he has a different type than you and why does he feel the need to have to do it i mean because if he s doing it in front of her and also is he doing it all the time yeah and i also hate it i hate it i also don t like that he s like i ll try and hide it from you how i just don t A A do that my guy the A A i hate it it feels like it i hate if he can t if you can t reason with him through conversation to me it feels like a deal breaker i don t even feel like it s worth reasoning is that A A i don t feel like it s worth reasoning if it s bothering you it s bothering you and it s not okay and i don t want him to hide it from you i want him to never have done it and he s done it and it kind of feels like he s gon na keep doing it is what he s saying but hide it and all of that just makes me think like sayonara sucker he s she they ve been together for years yeah sayonara sucker well you know it s not that easy to say goodbye to our year relationship but maybe it is time to take inventory of the positives and negatives in your room okay then you guys have been together since you re i mean crazier and yeah i get that sayonara sucker you don t deserve that you don t deserve to have to ask him to hide his checkouts i agree and i would also do a check in with yourself of like what excites you about the relationship what does he do that does fulfill you and is this the very only thing that upsets you are you there because you re comfortable and you re afraid of change or are you there because you love him and life is worth being with him if you re there because it s easier to stay than go get gone i agree and if it really is isolated to this i would have a deep heart to heart with him talking about how it affects you and asking him to stop his behavior because i don t think it s right quite honestly yeah and you know at the end of the day if you don t like what you hear from him get a A A ginger hamster and name it lizzy oh okay well i hope we helped and thank you guys all for watching and enjoying and supporting our podcast uh if you want to follow us on social media we re at the sip official lizzy also has a vlog channel

talk about um how far how far how hard it is you re not a part of your own Community yes dude it was hard today it was hard so we went to lunch and I got these fried pickles which were that s all Lizzy thinks and talks about there are three reasons I come to Colorado and the first of which is you the second of which is the Sip the third of which is those A A crispy fried pickles I think it s in reverse order but that s fine it s definitely pickles I just didn t want you to feel bad I already know that that s what you re coming to Colorado for I used to come to Colorado before I even knew the pickles existed they re pretty good I didn t know that you had such uh uh uh heat resistant tongue yeah all I do is eat scalding come right out of the fryer yeah I wait five minutes because I know I have a sensitive tongue and I still burnt my tongue which ruined the rest of my lunch and Lizzy had started eating them immediately eating them like they were like going to be taken from me if I didn t and she s fine yeah every time I burnt my fingers honestly it was hard to hold them oh so your fingers aren t as strong as your tongue no wow I think I have the opposite problem yeah but it s because I m constantly eating scalding hot A A because it s like I need it the food there s delicious I m still like watering at the mouth just thinking about it when I m reading that menu I was just like and we didn t even know there was breakfast at that joint I don t even think we know the name of that joint no it s like B I think it s black Huss house whatever it is it s great so good on Main Street in Parker it s delicious it s delicious and we re recording on a Sunday which is new for us new for us we re discovering new things like there s a farmer s market in Parker and we missed it because we re a little too late and then we discovered this place has brunch and oh my gosh is the menu incredible I like yawning because I m so full hmm But no that A A hit yeah Lizzy s wondering she got so full she got sick of course which is like every time I eat with her Lizzie gets sick and then she blames it on my driving and I said you were sick before I started driving and she goes well it seems like it could be both and then she goes I wonder if the pickles would taste as good coming up as they work no I said I bet they would I don t even I m not even curious about it I know for a fact those pickles would taste just as good coming back and while we were sitting there every time she contemplates could I travel with these and I go if you do just air fry them when you get home and while you re on the plane be courteous enough to put them in a Ziploc bag so the stench is isolated no and she said absolutely not it s already stinky enough on this and I just thought how like that s the etiquette I m talking about you got to be nice to those smelling around you nobody wants to smell pickles in a airplane yeah that s totally fair but I feel like in an airplane those fried pickles would be a welcome smell in comparison to the other A A that s going on depends on who you are dude someone on the airplane today was watching something on their phone with no headphones I was like what the audacity like well yeah I was like what is this the DMV wow yeah I tried going to the DMV the other day and they were appointment only so I had to leave damn sorry while we re on airports do you want to go into what has become a recurring segment of airport horror stories yeah I mean it s not necessarily a horror story okay but it is like a come look on dude story okay so at the airport this morning it s always them not her no it is honestly it is and it s shocking how often it s them they are the common denominator um so like the more and more I realize that it s like TSA doesn t know dick about A A like they re nothing and no one wow honestly I mean it is a tedious hard job I can t imagine having to encounter that well look at the like the caliber of the person who s doing it it s like I don t know okay I don t know if that s a blanket statement I mean I like I mean at least at Burbank and Denver Airport I can tell you the TSA is subpar okay I go there a lot that the service is fine I don t think you can make blanket statements about the type of people that are TSA no I m not talking about the type of person that is TSA I m talking specifically about those on shift at these two specific locations okay well no the Denver Airport keeps it moving like at A A Burbank I m just like why are you in your own way and then why are you a A A to me because you re in your own way I hate the power tripping sometimes yeah sometimes you encounter somebody who s really just on a power trip so This Woman s wearing a mat oh also like I know I m not supposed to have anything in my pockets but it s also five o clock in the morning literally so I think in my mind yes I ve taken all of the A A out of my A A Pockets before I go through that x ray machine you know what I m saying so if something Bings in there it was a goddamn accident right I know I did not knowing and willfully go through the A A machine with A A in my pockets A A I m not trying to slow up my day or yours or any of these fine peoples so I go through and like first of all when I get in she s wearing a mask and she s mumbling and Whisper talking in one of the loudest places in the world you know what I m saying she s like and I I literally turned and I go what and she goes I said don t move we re gon na have to do it again and I m just like okay A A let s do it again then you know what I mean and like I do it again and again she goes Whispering I m just like not moving I m like what like speak up I m like five feet away from you you re mumbling in a loud place with a mask on like I can t hear you and every time she s just mumbling it s like I know you can talk loud because you re talking loud to chastise me after I can t hear you speak up what and so like so we do that three times she s super A A annoyed with me and I m like I wouldn t this wouldn t be A A up if you didn t keep mumbling the second I get set in my spot I m moving to A A hear you then I get out she goes you have something in your pockets and I go I don t know and I look in my pockets and go yeah I guess I do have these headphones in my pocket she s like well I m gon na have to Frisk you now and I m like all right dude how about it I don t A A care she s like I m gon na have to put these through the conveyor belt and it s like all right put my headphones through the conveyor belt because I m hiding blades in those tiny little pods yeah put them through the A A conveyor belt A A so she puts him back through and she s like can I do it out here or do you want to do it in private and I m just like I don t care just A A Pat me down dude like let s get this moving and then she starts patting me down and she had to hold him this wouldn t happen if you hadn t had those in your pockets it s like okay dude again I wasn t trying to A A up anybody s day here it was a mistake that these headphones were in my pocket why are you being a weird nasty A A to me while you re touching my cookie yeah she touched your cookie they have to wow yeah like and can you they like so like cookie they just brush like this over your whole yeah that s some excitement for five a m I mean I don t know I was in Raging because it s like I m coming off a pap smear like I don t really want to be touched right now by another stranger it was awful wow and then you get on the plane so I ve been booking flights through United yeah um because they have the perfect time frames that are actually the cheapest options for me to do these day trips and I uh they you have to pay extra for a better quote better seats yeah and then they have some that are unlisted which the assumption is it s because they re someone sitting there so they have only available for the price take like as I go with just whatever the price of the ticket is because I don t A A care like I m yeah it s a two hour flight I m dead anyways and I get a middle seat because it s the only open option that s not to dollars more expensive yeah which multiply it s not that much money but still it s an unnecessary expense in my opinion which thank you but honestly you know what I mean like if I was going somewhere else and it was for another reason I would probably get the A A comfortable seat but it doesn t matter you can it doesn t matter because get this okay they re telling me usually I can get a window seat like that and it s not a problem yeah but this time they said only middle seats and I was like that s A A weird so I m like whatever I book a middle seat I get on the plane there are multiple rows with nobody in them so I got a whole row to myself I just got up and moved wow yeah and some idiots paid extra for those seats I mean because United s running a scam always the case no United literally says they re unlisted they re like they re learned selected so that you have to either get the middle seat or pay more for a nice receipt and they re scamming you it s a threat up front yeah yeah it s it s you re not going to get a great seat unless you pay for the seat Well the seats aren t even different they re just isolating them and saying you can t have them but you can buy the nice seats no they they made it look like none of the other ones were available and then they only had upgrade options for seats that are usually just a bearer price which I usually book and I know because I do this like three times a month yeah you know what I mean and I was just like wow you Shady A A I got a whole seat to my whole aisle whole row suck on that United wow teach you to rub my cookie hmm did we ever get to uh the ginger ignoring me yeah no tiny baby boy after lunch we re walking by I say Ryland distract the dad I m gon na grab that little ginger boy and he s gon na be my son and at this point I m on board like I m gon na raise him with you so it s fine like we re plotting This Together watch your kids hide your kids especially your Ginger Kids because we are gon na snatch the A A this was like a ginger God like a tiny little fire engine yeah and like his dad had dressed him very cute he had high top Nikes on he was a cutie and Lizzy s like as soon as the dad turns around Lizzie s like plans in action she s like hi I go hi he goes daddy told me not to say hi to Crazy Ginger lady is because they re gon na snatch me and I said whoa he is eloquent for a two year old he didn t talk to us but he didn t look her way and I said wow it must hurt your feelings to be rejected from a group you thought you were a part of and then I saw a Jeep and I said yeah like when we had a Jeep all other Jeep owners would wave at me when I would pass so then I thought it would be the same when we got a Tesla and I was like okay so I m like driving my new Tesla and I see the next the first Tesla I passed and I m like oh my gosh we re like family like we re part of this we re like part of uh like you said yeah your community of like electric vehicles and I wave and the other person s just like this isn t the community I thought it was he really thought oh oh swerve damn sorry about that buddy it s okay I ll wave at you from just Tesla thanks yeah not all redheads love you not all Tesla owners love me well you know and that s A A up because like there s strength and ginger numbers so I don t know hmm if you re a ginger and you see a ginger say hey oh do you want to talk about how jealous you are of me this weekend excuse me those were the verbatim the words you used oh cause you get to hang out with your mom and go to the movies well not only that but because I went on a fall hike oh yeah well I wasn t jealous of you what no I was jealous of your brother and Stacy because they got to hang out with me yeah on a hike oh sad it s about me yeah it s always about you bro no but what I did think was cute was when I had gotten in the car Stacy had told me something that had completely turned her day around that was directly in relation to something you had shared on the podcast and I thought wow she really is changing lives oh wait now I m a little upset why because was it the podcast what podcast it was something it wasn t my Vlog oh my gosh CeCe wasn t talking about my Vlog she probably watches the Vlog too but this was because podcasts you repeated the same exact story because I don t not much happened to my life wow anyway it was the just for today which Lizzy has been using to turn around her mindset and mood and she said do you remember what she said her just for today was because then Stacy goes you know what I should implement the just for today in my life as well yes so I m looking for the message and also reading every other text messages hold on I got ta scroll through my pictures to get there we ll be there someday soon guys you know you can just hit albums to get to the bottom you re crazy this is one way to do it okay come on we re so close come on Lizzy stop we re in my Vegas trips okay we re at the base so Stacy my beautiful friend said I have a stray for you I ve been doing the Just For Today thing a bit this morning I felt not great and I told myself just for today I m going to choose to believe in myself which is beautiful and then the universe gave me a test I got a flat tire an hour away from home by myself and I almost started crying but I remembered my task for the day and I changed the tire myself what was the task for the day again uh just for today I m going to believe in myself yes and so she thought my brother was on an important work call he didn t know exactly that it was an emergency that she was calling and she was an hour away as she said getting her hair done and she didn t know she had a flat tire so she drove away from where she was at and so she was isolated with a flat tire and she was like well I don t know what to do and then when she remembered that what she had set her intention from from this thing that you had implemented she thought you know what I can change the tire yeah and she successfully got her spare tire her tire off and the spare tire on and I thought wow that s big because that s A A crazy I would have cried you didn t get that from me you got that from yourself girl because I would have been on the side of the road A A just playing dead waiting for help you know what I m saying scream crying A A myself that s what I would have been doing I just would have given up like well that s the same that s the equivalent of me for A A myself I know but that s like a big feat to no it s like your car deal yeah I just thought wow when you re determined the things you can do I think when in doubt I m gon na try to Stacy out that s the next thing that s the next slogan when in doubt Stacy out look at this coming full circle wow and now now the the student has become the master what could you do if you believed in yourself wow that give me chills see myself start crying it s the sound of the throne that made me laugh harder gosh I was really going somewhere with this I was segwaying into something and now I forgot because of the throat crackles oh I remember so it s nearly or our two year anniversary it s like okay who could ever really say like I saw some edits from people that were very kind and saying like two year anniversary yeah and I thought hmm what does that mean what does that mean is it when we premiered well who would know well why don t we know I don t know I know we re not in episodes yet no but also episodes means nothing because apparently a year is weeks if you do every week There s weeks in a year right so if we did and we always take like two weeks off at Christmas but we re we take all week off at Christmas we usually take four weeks off total all year okay look at us go yeah um and so that got me thinking like well I ve been kind of burnt out when it comes to a lot of things same and especially the podcast like and it s not just because of our podcast but because like I m also doing Shane s podcast right now and six episodes tended like roughly a week a month is a lot it s more than two a week and so I ve been feeling like this like oh my gosh what how am I going to and it s less of like the actual recording it s more of like the edit exercise of the whole process of like the editing the thumbnailing the uploading the audio the the video the titles the descriptions the ads it is a lot of work and so like I was like starting to get to this point where I like felt like I was being ungrateful about the podcast kind of banging my head on the wall and then like a few things happened to lead us to a place where we didn t upload an episode a couple weeks ago and you know it really warmed my heart and kind of turned all of it around for me what is seeing all of the people that talked about like how it s built into their routine yeah and them saying like how we re a part of their day or at what point in their day were a part of and how we re implemented in their routine I thought wow you know this really is like something so uniquely special that we ve built that you guys have supported that is such a community community and as we re coming up on episodes which is a big deal it s a lot of it s a big deal big deal it s a big deal Pickle is that the kind of deal I say it is no yeah but you just said deal right when you said a big deal Pickle but you usually say big deal see I I don t even know how or when I m saying something wrong and mill whatever it s okay anyways I wanted to wrap it around too and I know it s premature to celebrate episodes but I am so grateful for what you guys have allowed us to be able to do for a job and it kind of reset my mind in thinking it was never that I like didn t like the podcast it s that like you everyone gets burnt out at the point where it s just like I feel like I m gon na never ever and you know me I m always like no no we re doing it no matter what we re doing it we re doing it we re doing it and like last week I was like yeah we just can t do this we just can t do it this week we just can t just can t do it but it was a little break I needed and it honestly gave me like a a reasoning in which and again it has nothing to do with the podcast it has everything to do with me and feeling overwhelmed and trying to take on so much but anyways yeah this is the funnest job I ve ever had in my entire life it is very fun the two of us honestly get to sit down together and be BFFs and talk A A about each other yeah it s like something I want to do even after everything you know what I mean always in and forever yeah it s a fun thing we get to do here where s can you believe it no I can t stupid hot yeah it s insane very crazy here I love it me too well that was sweet that was sweet wasn t it dude are we kissing on the lips or should we do that on the th episode that s our episode th episode I can slip it into no should we do it on the th episode because that s two years oh we ll talk about it okay I hate to keep talking about myself but should I keep talking about myself what we re gon na say well I have okay two things I can pick from Snapchat stars and Snapchat scandals or my honeymoon update what s the Snapchat star I just say like well Shane s been Snapchatting a lot so I call my Snapchat s t a r it s like a Snapchat star they call Snapchat the actual platform calls their users snap Stars like that s what they call it when you re like a verified Creator and so like Snapchat s really like coming around they re like Reinventing the game for creators and a lot of creators are going over to Snapchat because Snapchat is trying to make it worthwhile they re like trying to innovate ways to make creating exciting for creators like they re making what is Instagram stories potentially monetizable which I m shocked Instagram hasn t done that already it kind of feels like Instagram is just like a bed A A it s because it s honestly it s probably because it got bought by Facebook meta yeah like Facebook like no offense but like a reptilian like Mark Zuckerberg doesn t understand the human condition or what compels a person to enjoy scrolling yeah and it like infiltrating my feed with A A I don t know all the time does not make me want I don t want to look at a A A stranger all the time no I want to look at the people I follow yeah so you know figure it out Mark you little lizard anyways we re on Snapchat all the time well Shane even more so than me but I m like kind of daily unedited vlogging on Snapchat and it s been very fun but I had a little bit of a snap Scandal might you say why so you know well I had a bad relationship with Snapchat you know it s how my nudes got leaked oh I didn t know that you didn t no I was working at clever at the time like were you just you just so right when Shane and I had started to date I didn t realize I was snap stupid I didn t realize every snap you took and sent yeah although it expires after somebody opens it it saves in your like scent snaps so there s like a portal inside of Snapchat that all the stories or snaps you ve sented exist in a library for you and Shane was on his book tour I was going out of town and I was sending nudes to Shane I feel like when you start dating somebody it s like something people do you know um I guess maybe nowadays it s a little bit different because more people have had mishaps with it um but yeah I didn t have like this was like before two step verification was a thing like no it was a thing but it wasn t super prominent all over the place and somebody had hacked my snap chat I was taking off on a plane I get a call from Shane right before the plane takes off and he s like you knew it s circulating and I was like well I m about to lose service for three hours so oh good luck to me and yeah somebody hacked my Snapchat and then posted the snaps that I had sent to Shane publicly was it raw dick or was it like dick and panties no dick dick damn my face wasn t in it I ve never seen them it was from here down well thank you very much I wouldn t look I think it s A A up when people look at A A that s been unintentionally so leaked outside of that though my Snapchat was something I used in my early s so now to send dick pics having open SnapChat again and we re like in we re like posting on Snapchat Shane actually has access to my Snapchat account like he can post for me it s like this feature that they have because they have like celebrities doing this so like if you have a celebrity client walking a red carpet and I m your assistant I can be taking Snapchats and uploading them in real time from my phone nice and so like Shane has that for me so like if he has funny picture he wants to post of me he can but then I think he has like access to my Snapchat and I got somebody that I was following that had messaged me and it was like a guy s name and I had opened it and I think that then he had saw I had opened it and the guy had said hey cutie to me so Shane was like are you messaging guys on Snapchat like are you pulling an atom oh my God and my heart sorry no I would no I m like I m on social media I m not like first of all if I m gon na cheat on somebody I m gon na break up with them first like that is hands down how I feel about like like my relationship is good but aside from that if it was bad my moral compass tells me that you should break it off instead of I know it s not always like like I guess cheating can get messy and situations happen without whatever but I do think like if you re going to do something you should have the respect for your person to break up with them first because obviously you don t respect your relationship so you don t want to be in it yeah and I guess some people s situations deter them from doing that anyways this is all outside of that it was just still like just some stranger message well and I don t know if it was somebody I had messaged when I was because they were my friend like the general know that I don t know them but they were my friend on Snapchat because so I don t know if I was like promiscuous on snap in my early s you don t know well I m I m sure I was I was like how do you not remember because I was on all that long ago I m and I was promiscuous am I I think you re I m and I was Ultra promiscuous like to or so it s a very long time ago years and I was acting out on all platforms you know like I wasn t it wasn t and out in the streets yeah that s what I mean like I was like using platforms to meet up in real life so it wasn t exclusive to anything no but then I just got so scared I did open it and I saw it and then I was like and then after chainsaw I was like oh my God God oh my God so wait wait you saw it first and did not tell Shane and why would I tell Shane that so they messaged me hey cutie so I m not replying to it so then Shane opened it on his own and saw it and it came to you but I didn t replied or anything right but then I was like but it said scene on it man and then I just unfriended him because I have no business with somebody that s trying to flirt I mean I also don t well I guess he was like my friend to be able to get into my DMs but that s no different in my opinion than somebody like coming unannounced into my DMs flirting with me right it s not like I m engaging in the behavior or do I want to people come into your DMs and flirt with you um I don t know no one s flirting with me are you sure you re going to like your second requests I feel like a majority of the people that interact with me anywhere as women I have extreme DM anxiety so I don t you don t even look I don t like to engage I honestly don t really look at my restricteds all that often unless I ve like posted something where I do want to see what people have said or if you ve asked a question yeah prompter yeah so anyways that s my Snapchat Scandal damn that made me uncomfortable it makes me uncomfortable too yeah also it s just so slow like that is something I don t understand like we were talking about in last week s episode just like messaging people on social media when you re a social media personality or you re like Adam Levine s a celebrity it s just like that is messy beyond belief yeah I would it s like it s weird weird it s like Snapchatting doing something illegal like why would why are you doing that what do you mean just literally posting and on a public forum that you re doing something wrong oh right yeah yeah giving a stranger who owes you nothing I m ammunition against you when you have everything to lose silly goose A A today s podcast is sponsored by Mint mobile and after years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big Wireless providers if we ve learned anything it s that there s always a catch so when I first heard that mint mobile offers premium Wireless starting at just bucks a month I thought what s the catch but after talking to them and actually using their service it s all made sense because there isn t one MIP mobile secret sauce is that they re the first company to sell wireless service online only so they cut up the cost of retail stores and pass those sweet savings directly to you they actually sent me a Wireless plan to test and try out before talking to all of you I put it into one of my previous iPhones and so now I m rocking two phones but I have to say my mint mobile is incredible the service I get outweighs my current provider so much so that I m thinking of switching over even though I m in a long ancient family plan it seems to still financially make the most sense so for anyone who hates their phone bill mint mobile offers premium Wireless for just bucks a month they give you the best rate whether you re buying for one or for a family and it meant families start at two lines all plans come with unlimited talk and text plus high speed data delivered on the nation s largest G Network you can use your own phone with any mint Mobile plan and keep your same phone number along with your

recall and I can t see far enough to understand what our little well I don t have anything here specifically from you oh you wanted you brought in the one chip challenge oh that could be like an iced topic iced tea topic so do you know what the one chip challenge is so the one chip challenges people are like special ordering like the world s hottest potato or uh tortilla chip like the hottest pepper chip you could find in the entire world special ordering it yeah you they only will sell you one at a time because it s so hot where do you get it from on the internet and so did they get one for us A A no well then why are we talking about it because I want to talk about how A A stupid it is people are calling and getting carted off in an ambulance after the fact that s how A A hot it is this guy ate a whole one and the challenge is I guess to wait to see how long you can go before you like drink milk or like have yogurt or something to like chill out but this guy like posted one he s like I think I m on a faint and he has to like sit down he s sitting on the floor reading because he s like I feel like my face is exploding like also think about how that s just gon na feel coming out because the the ambulance can t do anything for you see I understand the I guess you would call it desperation because I have you were around when I participated in something similar which is the calorie Challenge and then I think you filmed me doing the cinnamon challenge yeah and that s like you do those things for what you know I mean I just I did the cinnamon challenge because I was like these people are A A A A and then I did I was like I m gon na die yeah and then I found that people do do die doing the cinnamon challenge wow yeah I didn t know that I am interested in this tortilla chip though don t you A A dare me I mean if you did do that for some on some Snapchat A A like that s A A stupid I know it just sounds intriguing I haven t seen any of them so I don t know you feel like challenge accepted kind of don t do it it s stupid so that s what I m thinking I m like teetering the line of is it desperate because you re like doing it for attention or is it people doing it because they want to actually experience the experience I don t think anybody wants to experience the experience I think it s on some like my dick is bigger than your addiction but without having seen it I kind of do want to taste the flavor I don t think it has a flavor it just burns like it s like eating like jalapenos raw no worse wow ghost peppers okay ugh I wish I hadn t told you about it no I m not really on Snapchat eating a one chip oh doing one chip challenge okay yeah maybe no okay how much did they cost no I like I m gon na put a parental lock on your A A Instagram searches now oh we got ta stop oh see you later okay I thought I would give a little bit of a honey update because it s the only place I have talked about like what Honey s going through and I still see a lot of people being like why is she still have a cone what s she still doing in a cone and I had told on another episode of the podcast that it uh what she did have a mast cell tumor is that what they re called and so she had to get it removed they didn t remove it all the first time so she got to heal for two weeks and be coneless but then she did have to go back in and get another surgery to remove the rest of it and now after that has been removed she was in a cone for another two weeks and then it scabbed this time so now like the scabb A A so when I take the cone off sheet it s it s just the scab and then it bleeds and then I freak out the wounds reopen so then I have put the cone back in so now it s been like three weeks of her in a cone and I m hoping I m gon na get a take it off soon but the good news is I do believe that they had got in the circumference of the mast cell and the cancer itself and it was isolated to the one spot the the cancer specialist did say that there was like the tiniest bit on the cartilage of her ear that they would not be able to get unless they removed it completely but she never moved the ear completely but she said it such a small percent of actual cells and so isolated that she said there s less than a five percent chance of it spreading or becoming worse and to just bring her in every like two months to see if like anything has grown so she said it was great positive news so I just have to believe that that s what it is yeah because she said honestly it s probably even less than a five percent chance that anything would come from that and their recommendation was hard of leaving it as it is okay so I mean I guess a positive update and I feel comfortable about it they kind of really walked us through the process and she s doing good she has like high energy none of that has ever affected kind of how she s been day to day and because it was a low grade trade which means that it s not progressed Beyond a sort of superficial lump on the on the body correct yeah yeah and so they said the only way that the only reason you need to be concerned in the future is if you see another one either in the same spot or a different spot completely and now that we know her body can produce that we just need to be hyper aware of checking all of the spots that could potentially have lumps or bumps and for all of you out there too like PSA be checking your dogs because before I had a dog that had that I wasn t like super like I feel my dog s all the time because they re always laying next to me I m petting them I m seeing them but like even the one in Honey s ear was so hidden that it took like a very specific angle and very direct sunlight for me to be like what is that well she s got so much hair like with my dogs it s easier to find because I find a lump and bump on my dog s the second it s a it appears because I m like constantly like in my mouth I m just sucking on these dogs all day um but I also like give them baths twice a week so and they have like short hair and then I have some exciting expanding our family news this guy you know we ve been manifesting you you don t call it manifesting no shopping for no manifesting what okay I m manifesting alpacas into our life you don t have to manifest something you can go out like I do because I ve researched up and down I have friends in the neighborhood who have alpacas yes and she has been helping me search uh for Alpacas as well who s the friend in the neighborhood well we ve become friends because she has alpacas oh so you re using her it s transactional she was walking past no she was walking past with her dogs and she said hi to me and then I she was the one that had mentioned she had alpacas and then we ve kind of created a relationship from there and so she s kind of forwarded me all the Facebook groups of like re homing alpacas in Colorado with alpacas they re livestock and they re herd animals so they re you need to get at least three and so are you rehoming three alpacas uh more like seven shut the A A up Ryland I thought one was too many you re not ready yeah seven Lizzy hold on hold on no I have questions have these seven been together the seven alpacas A A that s a lot of alpaca that s a pack I m still manifesting to an extent what s going on is the effect I like a family is selling their house and they re moving States and where they re going there isn t room for them so I kind of maneuvered my way into the situation and said like hey if this works out I want to get in here stat and so we ve been in like constant communication with them they ve checked out our barn they ve and like we ve been over there multiple times and so it is contingent upon their houses you don t name one of them Lizzy I will be so A A offended and I m not even joking and I mean Ryland why would you that s your name because what name is you name one Lizzy well that time you give Chris my couch none of them A A name one Lizzy none of them are children Justice for Lizzy I don t even know if we can lipstick teeth I don t even know if we can rename them and this is still like high hopes I mean there s seven of them I don t know you don t even know their names it s seven alpaca but the thing is like At first so it s two families um but they ve been together for their whole life so she was like if you absolutely had to you could do like the set of three or the set of four but they ve been together forever and they re she s like honestly going from four to seven with this type of animal isn t much different like the vet she s like in the five years five or so years that she s had them the Vets only come once and that s when one of them got pregnant they re trying to get her pregnant for their own they wanted a pet of another one they don t like breed them or anything yeah it was for themselves um and she was like and it was thirty dollars for an ultrasound and other than that they re like cats in the sense that they poop all of them make a poop pile and they all poop on the same pile what are you gon na do with that pile it actually their their poop doesn t smell okay they eat their own poop and then poop it again so you don t even have to feed them no what are you gon na do the poop pile dude the poop pile for a month or two and then you have a truck that does that come pick it up and then they eat natural grass and hay and you have to have water for them so they re how much hay does seven alpacas eat low she s feeds them a third of a hay Barrel every day for all three and she said like with our our fenced in barn area has really uh pretty grown in pasture right now before it like dies for the winter she was like if they do come here before winter this is what they ll eat until winter like you should give them some hay just as an option but that s what they will feed on and so we ve done a lot of research it s not like can you tell the difference between them what do you mean like can you tell that like are they distinct yeah they re all a little different variation of color do you have a favorite one uh yeah Ziva Ziva she s brown with like beautiful white spots and she s like permanently smiling she s so she was the one that we like gravitated towards can you hug me so they re not like social social animals but they have like these ones have become uh more so people so like they don t need people to exist they re livestock what do they sound like um I mean they don t really make noises unless they feel threatened not really if you piss them off they ll spit at you but that you have to be like really pissing them off okay them to want to spin but what do they sound like nothing really unless they re unless she said when they feel threatened they ll like make a noise and then she said that s why seven is good because especially if something were to ever like come towards them she said their defense mechanism is all seven kind of like run and heard fast together and it will like deter off and they ll make like weird noises and she s like if you hear them making weird noises they re kind of warning you as well that something s around so you should go out and check should we like call her and get her to make the noise on the podcast for us I need to know what that noise is and they re so cute we ve been doing like we fenced in our barn like seven months ago in anticipation for this and she came over and she told us how we would utilize our barn to do this I ve been to her house multiple times to learn how she does the day to day with them so it s not like this like woo like all of a sudden we re trying to do this and I and outside of this girl no you guys been talking about this for years I ve been like with the other neighbor that has alpacas I ve been trying to learn from a lot as well and they re giving us all their contacts in terms of like the the Vets the people that have trailers if they ever had to move so you would walk through an army of alpaca to get to the guest house no it s fenced in around the barn but wouldn t they live inside the barn during winter it s the Barn s very sectioned off inside because it was built for Animals the downstairs so there s stalls right and so like the front half they wouldn t have access to unless I left their the doors open that d be pretty fun though it would be pretty fun and she said they re very curious she they have like a utility shed that s like this very massive shed that s like a work room and a storage room and he s like if I m working in there I ll leave my doors open and they ll wander in and hang out with me while I m working wait that s so cute she said they re like very curious and also very sketched out at the same time like I love the idea of alpacas just free room like free range alpacas coming in and like to you guys editing like what is going on in here well that s what Shane said we have like that farm door back there he s like we could open the farm door and have their little treats I love that great idea so we re very excited if this doesn t work out we re still obviously on the search to re home some alpacas but what I like about this is they re all a family they ve all been together are pretty much their entire life and what s their lifespan years oh I m so jealous these ones um vary from well the baby s just one years old most of them baby yes so you could name the baby Lizzy and then the oldest one is like you could name the baby Lizzy we ll see what s the babies we haven t decided if we ll rename the album what s the baby s name uh I don t I could it s on my phone I have a picture of them but it s on my phone can you show me him no you can t get it it s fine they re so cute will you show me when we re done recording so much yeah I m really hoping it happens because the thing is if they sold they were giving the option to whoever bought the house to also have first dibs on the alpaca you know yeah um but the people that are thinking about their house right now actually already have donkeys so they didn t want the alpacas yeah I was like perfect I also think it s all the hair flip over alpacas is so weird and funny um I think it s crazy that your neighbors don t I mean look at we re crazy people we already have a fake alpaca made of alpaca fur you don t need to convince me you re a crazy person whenever the Uber pulls up and like it s that house with the dinosaur and the alpaca and now scarecrow now and that s the eye seven alpaca soon a cat none of which will be named Lizzy we don t so demanding is it demanding well I hope it happens for us we haven t like I ve been documenting the process like in real time on a vlog hoping that it comes to fruition like I ll be so bummed out now if it doesn t work and I have all this footage where I m like so excited about the alpacas yeah because my heart s dead set on them I get it so they re awesome wow they re awesome oh wow that totally

show he flies out here once a month for that and then he s already also very booked outside of traveling yeah so to come here and film episode so it s it s like most the time a couple of days that he would have to be available and so when we go to California I think it will be much more streamlined in that the three of us will be together again because I don t like to piggyback our recording episodes on the same because I don t want to film like two Shane episodes and then do two of our episodes because I want to give the best to everyone yeah and I don t want to be drained after filming I don t want to film five podcast episodes in the span of like three or four days that s too much yeah we want to be fresh and fun and then the second is are we celebrating Halloween and are we celebrating on the podcast yes and yes okay what are have you thought about what we re gon na be I thought about it at lunch today but you wouldn t let me tell you well what is it going to be I don t want to say it until we do it well sometimes some of your ideas for Halloween are like a hard no for me even when you re sold on them do you want me to try and Whisper it in your ear yeah okay take your headphone off have it oh good huh but your foot hold on I think I know you think swaps yeah from the norm yeah I m into actually I like that because the transformation for you is epic hysterical how are you gon na pull that off I m a magical witch okay I m thinking about the head situation I just spit on myself yeah I think that s good we need to start planning now though oh Jesus we have to start planning right now like no he s saying I m a magical witch decking myself in the mouth with the microphone sorry For Party Rocking I guess we ll talk about owls and possums later no I want to say something whoa I m low key belligerent right now okay what s going on no talk about talk about opossums I don t have nothing to say about them you don t have nothing to say about them so there was an opossum in my backyard that looks like A A Ryland Adams dude that is the most offensive thing I ve ever heard in myself it looks just or I think it was a video and at the very end of the video I felt like it was almost a test to make sure that I watched your uh text videos all the way through to see if I would comment on YouTube like it looks like Ryland Adams at the very end of like a minute video because this is what you do Lizzy will like the other day she sent me a video of her and bubs at the mall A A loves them all so Lizzy I look cute right like she sends me a picture of her and bubs walking through the mall but it never ends like as long as A A because he s just beaming it might be the best time from one door of them all to the door on the opposite end like a three minute clip of Nothing But Lizzy walking her dog in the mall and I was like is there any like couldn t you just give me the second version no okay so you think this possum looks like me yeah what do possums do I don t think they do much they re climbers they re trash properly probably and then the other thing that kind of scared me is last time you were here we were oh I told you we were walking the dogs and there was an owl in a tree watching us and I said watch your A A back because they re owls yo Oscars bro I didn t see it and then I looked up and I don t know how you saw it because it was very camouflaged into the tree but it was on a low Branch because I m a woman and I have to be hyper aware of my surroundings because I could be snatched and brutalized at any moment in time I mean you re not wrong no I m not so no one wants to naturalize me though sounds like you want it no I don t okay wish if only one um I m manifest no no I m kidding take it back whenever we talk about A A on this podcast it happens that was me cleaning it off that was me striking the record of them but then since we saw that ow I ve heard numerous stories of people being attacked by Alex I told you this owls like to attack people it s because they go for the juggler and the eyes yeah why do they want I don t know faces it s A A it s A A I don t know I just see it everywhere I don t understand it but their talents and they re so strong they can like scalp a A A get out of here yeah they ll grab a bitch s weave real quick I just don t find it necessary like go get what you actually want go get some mice you weird A A yes very snake it was very Regal and pretty though was it yeah I don t know I looked up and I was like oh it s like scary oh it s so beautiful threatening yeah hmm okay makes me scared to think about I wanted to make an announcement on the podcast oh you re welcome too thank you so I think that we do we spend a lot of time on this podcast A A on our husbands and I wanted to tell everybody that I got home yes or not yeah yesterday Jesus time is really crazy lately I got home yesterday and guess what my husband had done what steamed the carpets you re kidding me I m not I was like who is she what did you do wrong you better have blowed him blown him I think that s the equivalent of like what that s worth if I came home I bought a steamer the other day because when Riley was a puppy she had made stains on the carpet that I haven t been able to get out so I ordered one on Amazon if I got home and saw that Shane had unboxed that and done it himself yeah I would get on my A A knees and give him two blow jobs in a row whoa thank God Joe doesn t listen to this podcast I hope Shane does and he does that right I ll pay you in that way wow okay yeah he s very nice no we love our husbands and Joe bought the steamer himself after I asked him million three A A yeah wow yeah and then just now when I landed at Denver Airport I called him and he s like oh I just steamed under the ottoman too seems like he s addicted he s a little steam fiend whoa something over here okay come on Joe come on out Joe when we do the movie out here he ll steam your carpets okay I love him he s so cute lately it s crazy wow yeah crazy all right let s get into the whoa let s get into some advice though do you want to read I m blocked out right out I ll read no I ll do it okay how many Diet Cokes did I have at lunch probably he just that he s like he knew he s like he heard me here before we left because I was like I m gon na need seven Diet Cokes I might have had seven Diet Coke he was top tier at his job he really was he was on top of it even like when you were just close to the end of your diet coke it was like yeah he didn t even take the previous class he just swapped him out stealthy one funny yeah didn t stay too long one complaint oh but that wasn t his fault you asked The Other Woman for Aid one no that s not my complaint oh I asked for a trio sampler oh Lizzy asked for the impossible ah you did no this is Lizzy at the restaurant so everything does look good she goes okay I just don t know between and then she listed items and I was like he can not tell you it was three items and then he goes oh I don t I don t know no I told I was three items I said what s the deal with these breakfast tacos the poutine and the hash and he goes they re all very good everything here is very good I was like I know A A but like which one or can you get me a trio sampler he said I could ask and I was like please do and he acted like that was all a joke it was not a joke he didn t deliver on that he did not deliver on that although I do think that s outside of him I don t give a A A I ve worked with many chefs at many restaurants and none of them really want to do anything that you ask them all right that s fair okay let s get into it okay all right civilized I m being civilized yeah I had to take a deep breath because I m a little bit off the rails sometimes I just like lose control of myself and I just want I want to get crazy I hear you the last time we were trying to be serious I like had nightmares for a week that I couldn t get there because I was too caffeinated it wow whoa see this is what I m talking about okay hi Lizzy and Ryland in my first year of uni I m in my first year of uni and I ve been seriously strugging struggling with self discipline about a year ago I was in a deep and dark place that s now made me a master of procrastination and overall laziness despite being less depressed now prior to this I was very disciplined and had proper routines that got me top grades and stable mental health people always preach being kind to yourself which is what I did but I ve gotten too deep into self kindness that I now give myself too many tickets allowing myself to rot in bed all day uh all day long complaining that I need to rest and honestly I kind of do but not the amount of resting ever reaches uh no amount of resting ever recharges my batteries I feel as though Rylan seriously has his A A together that s not true and I d love to hear how he does it I feel like I am pretty productive though like in my day you re a productive maniac skipping no I think this is a really great question a very good submission because I do think we re in an era where we re what s being preached upon ourselves is to give ourselves kindness and Grace to not feel the pressure to get everything done and to be a superhero but like where does that line end yeah I think that there also needs to be a re articulation of what pressure is because I think sometimes we allow everything to be pressure and it s not pressure at all what do you mean I think that we ve become a little bit sensitive like coming out of the pandemic everyone s like be easy on yourself be kind to yourself it s like guys the reality of the situation was we got two years off right I mean and not I spent a majority of my time staying up till four o clock in the morning watching prepper reality TV shows and sleeping yeah you know what I mean and I know this isn t a blanket statement because like obviously if you have a mental disease or if you struggle clinically with depression like I m not talking to that specifically but what I am saying is I am frequently preaching like uh maintaining happiness is hard work because you have to implement routines like do I want to wake my ass up and go work out no but I know that if I don t at around P M more depressive thoughts than normal creep in so like yeah if I don t follow a strict routine I find myself more depressive the more depressive you are the more you re inclined to lay on your couch and watch TV and try to get like dopamine from things that don t actually give you dopamine even when I find myself scrolling on social media for longer than I should it s like this is like without me even realizing it it s bringing me down and down and down when I could be out being productive finding something creative and productivity does not for sorry I m struggling here but the idea is it s for me it s like a chicken and an egg conversation like what came first and it s like yes I do think it s toxic to believe that productivity is the uh is a quantifiable source of your worth yes but I don t and I don t think that that s true that s not what I m saying productive in your creativity though and like right what I m saying is I think being a person believing that you are worth the time investment of ensuring you feel well is what you need to train your brain to believe it s not oh I have to do this thing it s oh I get to do this thing for myself I get to brush my teeth because it s something that makes me feel better about myself I get to make my bed when I wake up in the morning because when I come home from work it makes me feel better to see my room put together and that s what I mean prioritizing the things that will make you live a happier more productive life in whatever you choose that to be and reframing it from the pressure of the world putting work upon your shoulders to the privilege of treating yourself well yeah the way you deserve to be treated because I think a lot of times like the procrastination monster is telling you A A you you don t deserve mental peace and that s why I m going to push you to the brink of your deadline because that causes anxiety for you and then forces you into this toxic sleepless night where you try to finish everything really quickly and just get it done half assed and then you re not proud of your work you re tired and you re tired and you re shame spiraling so you do it again and again because you can t get out of this hole and this is going to be sound really fun I think she s on the opposite end of that right now like she s she s saying that she is not enacting anything that s making her do healthy habit things exactly that s what I m saying like you get sucked into like make doing one unhealthy thing it s like what you said sucks you into a spiral of doing many unhealthy things right and my my whole thing that s kind of annoying is just do it and I would say building a habit takes time it s proven that and you takes time but you just have to do it and I would start with maybe one or two or three things that you implement in your everyday life say if I did these three things every day that is a step forward in a healthy direction for me to do whatever it is I want to do in a better state of mind yeah and so I would choose like I m not gon na get on the couch or on Instagram until after pm I m not going I m going to like brush my teeth and make sure I go on a minute walk every day and do those three things for a week and once those become a routine Habit in your life add a couple more and then I think I m a big believer in like planting a seed today for it to grow tomorrow so even if you don t feel the immediate results just keep it down put it in front of you have a goal start slow you don t need to like conquer the whole world today it s just for today but Implement one two three things yeah and start going because I do think like there is like a generation that is saying like being lazy is okay that is a thing yeah but then there s on the flip side of that we were in a pandemic where everyone was forced into a more relaxed more isolated lazy environment and even though it s relaxed and isolated it was mentally stressful because every day is a new pummeling of we re A A we re A A that s what I m saying if she doesn t fully have to blame herself for getting to this point no but I think you are responsible for getting out of it yeah and you can save yourself yeah and I know I really I know it sounds annoying but you just have to take that first step and write it down pick a few things write it down put it somewhere that you can t ignore it every day and stick to it my things are I do I work my body so that I sleep and I sleep better at night when I work my body out pretty harshly for an hour not harshly but like I do a good workout for an hour I work my mind out for at least an hour which means I think like uh it s a version of meditation I share what I m feeling I read uh spiritually connected materials and I interact with spiritually connected people yeah I will um and then I brush my teeth and I make my bed I brush my teeth twice a day and I make my bed big priorities for me are sleep I feel like I am so much more myself I feel better if I sleep so I really do prioritize eight hours of sleep um some sort of meditation or something from my mind if it s not meditation it s yoga something for my body and I do like to try to get something work related done and then that allows me in my time off to feel that I m rewarded in being able to sit on the couch for three hours and not feel guilty about it and a big thing for work for me is I literally just have to do it yeah you know what I mean I can start I m ADHD insane I am out of A A control and it takes everything within me to stay focused on something but all I have now is this Mantra in my head of just do it yeah nope just do it Lizzy like I ll find myself straying and picking up my phone and be like nope putting it down just have to do it from to P M I just have to do it yeah and then with my Vlogs it s like I just have to do it till it s done but right it is what it is all right I loved that question yeah me too um I think it starts at the top hey Lizzy and Ryland I hope this message finds you well I know Lizzy has touched on this topic in other podcast episodes and her Vlog but I wanted to ask how do you convince convince yourself you are worthy of a good life ever since I can remember I ve hated everything about myself no matter what I achieve do or change that worthless feeling is always with me I E in May I graduated law school oh congratulations dude that s a huge A A feat and yet I still couldn t hate myself more it is starting to feel like a losing fight and I m lost on how to change my brain thank you guys for reading I love you both so much and thank you for weekly serotonin with love well first of all what a great accomplishment yeah and if you re not feeling satisfied or accomplished in that I would encourage you to explore hobbies that bring you strict Joy yeah I mean but beyond that it s really really hard to rewire your brain to convince yourself that you re worthy of Love specifically from yourself and I have this problem like I was born hating myself I hated this life I hated myself and I hated anybody who deserved who felt they deserved to be loved right because I was like if I m not worthy of love nobody A A is and you need to earn it Like Love is All conditional and that s not true but it takes for me it took a community of people who said things to me like we will love you until you love yourself and I was like okay you A A weirdo and then it s like oh my God yeah I love myself you know and if this is uh if this has to do with your upbringing if you ve realized it or not maybe like you didn t get that encouragement from your parents like Lizzy saying she found that somewhere I think in your chosen family you also need to find people that support and accept you yeah oh we got ta stop so what I m starting to realize like on this like Progressive like spiritual journey is like I did not learn the tools to love myself growing up so I have to learn them now as an adult and in order to do that it s like when something has to shed its skin to grow new skin I have to completely drop everything that I believe to be true about existing on this Earth as a human being and learn an entire new set of I had to build a whole new skin in order to love myself now and the way that you do that is you don t you don t you have to admit that you know nothing and then you have to embrace taking certain steps in the right direction and just trusting that they re going to lead to a change and spiritual steps lead to spiritual changes so it just takes it s like what we were talking about in the initial in the first advice question you just have to start with one thing today I m going to stop the negative self talk when I wake up in the morning I m going to say five really A A true nice things about myself and they can be asinine or they can be deep as A A but the first of which is you know I am a good person I deserve to be loved you say that to yourself every morning when you wake up I used to keep a picture of my myself as a year old on my door with a Post It note that says she deserves to be loved look at yourself as the child as a child and it s really hard to not love a child all right and and start to love yourself as if you are that child re like re raise yourself with the understanding that you are here for a reason and every single person on this Earth deserves to be loved yeah and that is a fact every single one even the A A worst of us deserves to be loved and you can fight me on that all you want but I honestly think it s true and it s much easier to go through this life loving people rather than hating I think most people that are being real A A are people that need love the most yeah you know yeah and so yeah approaching those kinds of people with compassion and love is good I can t specifically speak to this overall feeling but what you said Rings a note with me in like even relationships in general like if you really want to start anew with somebody that means a lot to you but you Phil has done you dirty it is almost you have to reach this point with anything if it s a friendship if it s yourself where you re saying like Okay everything that has happened I m going to put aside and build Anew and I think if you re not able to reach that or the tools that you need to start over yourself I think a therapist is obviously is honestly a very good option to guide you in the right direction I could not have done it without the support of the community that I ve joined yeah that I identify with and it s you know I didn t buy it for the longest time like all right you guys are A A stupid you re weird I don t know what this means when you tell me to fake it till I make it that sounds toxic to me because these are my set ideals but I m so A A desperate I m so desperate I will do exactly what you re telling me to do because I m out of I m out of my own ideas and you re yeah and anything like that is no longer an option and then eventually I m sitting in a room and I have an old toxic thought like A A you you don t deserve happiness and then another voice is like shut the A A up yes I do and I was like ah who was that who said that but the point being is if you start with one baby step at a time and can you can drop these self loathing thoughts you can and I it s it s like magic and I know like but you got ta work on it mine s less um poignant but I do think building the relationships around you that are also encouraging yeah that is also very important because if you re doing this work and then you have people around you that constantly are making you feel small it s just not ever going to work out and that s the other thing that s like people will say this to you and you don t believe it but it s like the second you start loving yourself and treating yourself as a like with self respect the people that hurt you and diminish you and keep you small in a dark corner can t be around you anymore no they leave they exit the second you re like actually I m gon na I m gon na have a little self esteem today yeah once you demand of what you want of yourself yeah you re gon na attract that into your life and demanding doesn t even mean you say like listen A A this is how I demand to be treated it s like you just start acting with self esteem doing esteemable acts the next time somebody really A A you over you re just not gon na A A with it it s just like no it s not I don t do this yeah this isn t what I tolerate and then they get tired of being around you because they re not able to feed off of you anymore so yeah you do it because you deserve it and even if you don t believe that I do eventually will too and we we both are here saying that we love you and we will love you until you love yourself so don t A A forget that you re you re literally worth it every single one of you every single one of us is worthy of love and it s unconditional and it s not transactional you just deserve to be loved period there is no A A pre log or epilogue yeah or fine print well I think we have to go oh your flight is leaving I ve got it so uh next week we have uh Our advice segment our submissions are both Mi the A A so it s like am I the A A version of advice though okay um so it s going to be very fun uh we ll see you next week and if you want to follow us on social media we re at the Sip official we re also on there personally Lizzy has a vlog Channel where she posts every single

on the podcast out in these streets show your boobs Chris boys you are really gon na do it yeah I hate that I mean a lot of people give me Flack for not calling you my fiance they get really really mad about it but for some reason I just hate the term fiance and I ve been in a lot of environments where if somebody is a fiance and I don t refer to them as such they get mad at me I get mad at you so I will not take the reverse of that when I don t call your husband your husband when you call Joe my boyfriend I get mad is someone showing their boobs or not I could give you a little well you don

good to be here oh well I met that real oh it s just weird because like I m sitting on like a not real chair in like a weird part of the living room that nobody ever sits so that s where I am on your podcast that s why the Vibes off that s why yes oh I feel negative that is so I posted a q a on Instagram I was like what do you want to know and a lot of the questions were straight up like why are you mean to Ryland in the Vlogs and I thought I d give you an opportunity to air your grievances I don t think I m mean to you in the Vlogs I don t think so either but it s perceived as such you know that I think because me and you have a a relationship where we like to poke and be mean to each other and then but we love each other I can t also if people are watching I can t see him because the tripod s blocking him oh like yeah that was not a dig at YouTube I m sorry I can see you perfectly fix it we can adjust the angle so you can see me if you want if you haven t had enough of me yes I can do it yeah just move it over there Chris you just sit pretty you just relax Chris relax Chris um I don t think I m mean do you think I m mean no not at all I think you re particularly kind on the Vlog as a fan and a friend I ve noticed Lizzy just told me she felt obligated to watch the Vlogs as though it was a job it s literally in the contract he made me sign Lizzy s not me neither I think some of your humor can be perceived as mean if people don t have like good friends in their life sorry all of y all are some friendly I feel attacked when you have a really good friend you can like say things that are funny and I don t and when you have a bad friend you have to be dry and dull if you said something that was mean and we got in a real fight I would cut it out of the video here s what I will say though when the camera turns on I do like get lost in it and I kind of take on a bit or Persona or whatever and I try not to do that anymore but like with Chris for example like my bit with Chris is like I m trying to A A him really hard but in real life that s we re not doing that okay good to know unfortunately yet and then yeah like me and you like I m kind of mean to you you re kind of mean to me but real life I guess we do do that yeah I mean depending on the day every couple has their little tiffs and their little riffs but we swim right through them uh Lizzy how are you I m good that s it okay thanks for being here thanks for having me no I m good um did you I don t know you ve been the one dragging us about how we re animal hoarders all day joking that you ve called the what of the state or the city I guess yeah nothing I have no questions for you I actually just met your new kitty upstairs Louie Louie Louie and also I think it s so sweet that he came into your lives yeah or life s she did make the connection too that he is the same coloring of Mario and would be the same age okay which devastates me I love that yeah I had a moment last night where I almost cried so I was well first of all I cried because I watch again which is such an emotional movie but anyway with Zac Efron wait I used to watch Charlie Saint Cloud with a blender full of red wine just so I could feel something that wasn t about myself back to you wow I haven t seen that one you want to cry now we re in a serious fight you keep doing this you re watching like amazing movies once I go to bed you know no Oscar with movies such as Again with Matthew Perry no they are though oh my god freaky Friday A A goes Joe and I just rewatched that wow yeah one of the best made comedies I ve ever seen I was like yeah which one is this Freaky Friday with Jamie it s all good anyways back to my sad cat drama um no so I was playing on the couch I was crying over again and I had Louie and then I looked at Louie and I had a moment where I was like are you Mario or like are you from Mario did Mario bring you to me and he looks up at me and then I realize I look down and he s cuddled with me and I m wearing my Super Mario show oh A A it was nuts and I had like oh my God I was just like whoa and but then it was that moment where I m like oh my God okay is he a person oh my God like like it was like a weird scary moment yeah you know what I mean like well like because it s like anything that s Supernatural or not like practical it can be a little bit overwhelming but I think that that s sweet such as Freaky Friday such as Freaky Friday imagine waking up and Jamie Lee Curtis s body also side note see I m just gon na go on a little tiny rant so I watched Freaky Friday I go to YouTube and I search Freaky Friday because I want to see some b rolls and behind the scenes and a bunch of stuff started popping up all these gen Z which I love gen Z no no offense you do yeah he has to say that we all have to no we don t all love them I don t care make a tick tock about me I hate I don t I care not here not now you can t we need all the Gen Z we can get you say you love them well now I ll get into this in a little while well anyways there s a bunch of videos of people being like freaky Friday s offensive freaky Friday s problematic why Freaky Friday is doesn t hold up because it s offensive and I m like because you re in a Chinese restaurant like what the A A are you talking about everybody needs to shut up Freaky Friday is a genius movie and um I love that there was a Chinese restaurant involved there s not enough I don t know the storyline so I can t confirm or deny what you re talking about fortune cookie and that s the thing that that s like the Talisman that transfers them for through bodies and until they have a full circle moment they can t return to each other s to their rightful bodies and does anyone actually save the day trying to save the day and does anyone actually care or is it just like something interesting you can scroll on Tick Tock I don t think anybody cares I don t know you just say to Taylor Swift recently what did they do to Taylor Swift I mean I don t know if Shane wants to be involved in our drama sessions but so when she stepped on the scale in the anti hero music video it says fat and there was all of this outrage because she s so skinny and when she stepped on the scale what she read was fat skinny people have body dysmorphia yeah you re preaching to the choir but that doesn t mean she didn t get canceled about it and that s what I mean everybody needs so loud people have feelings and I guess and I don t you can t Club all of gen Z in together as one right I will say that they re the generation that has pushed forward Tick Tock and I think because they re feeling big and mighty and able to I don t know she s a pop star she s probably had body issues her entire career because record Executives the public everyone was saying you need to be skinny and then she puts what she perceives her issues on the scale and she gets canceled I don t know that she was canceled because I didn t even hear about it didn t she sell like a bazillion CDs like nobody cares also Taylor s that s the thing that s so funny funny to me is like okay as somebody with so many Eating Disorders it s like it s so funny to me how normies I call them normies like Rylan people who don t have Eating Disorders how normies are always so shook when like a celebrity s like I have an eating disorder I m like yeah yeah no duh no no duh everybody in La I would say for the most part haven t eaten disorder it s hard it s hard up in these streets I think disordered eating can even be as complicated as I just overthink eating that s literally it I think it s if you think about food there s a number a certain number of times a day then you technically have an eating disorder I saw something online recently where like it s offensive for me to call myself an alcoholic now and that s when I was like oh for A A sake well what do you mean people who have disordered drinking or something no you can not even that it s like people who abnormally consume psychotic amounts of alcohol and ruin their friends and Family s lives lives and their own what s it called now I don t like you can Google it but there s a non offensive terminology for alcoholism and it s like I m gon na call it what it s called I m an alcoholic and how are we all supposed to dance around what we don t fully know about that was made up by somebody who wanted to be mad for no reason that s the thing because then it s like it s also like saying like oh so being an alcoholic is offensive if we re gon na call this word triggering an offensive it means the thing that it is is offensive and I am not offended by the fact that I am an alcoholic oh I do have okay I have an issue this is on in the similar path with YouTube because okay I had to take out the word well you can just believe me but I did take out the word from one of the Jeffrey videos because YouTube demonetized it so I had to like take out the word and it was Jeffrey saying it about himself right and then I was thinking like wait a minute isn t this kind of homophobic like to take away a gay person s right to say absolutely weird like that that s but I was like who cares I m just gon na take it out but it was interesting and then in one in a podcast we did we had to take out a word I m not gon na say it but that s the equivalent in England or something I don t I feel like we need to have a revolution and we need to you know take back our word yeah I mean I ve already been taking it back I slang it out and Lizzy you can use it too thank you well do you have anything to say about our Animal Hoarding what has it been like for you no because I do I have mental breakdowns a lot about it I mean I love our animals but I wouldn t honestly know how much time you re spending in the morning feeding these A A a lot my before I got to sit at my desk this morning it was an hour because I not only have all of the animals but now the cat isn t fully acclimated to the other animals right so I bring the dogs down and then I m trying to do their routine and then I got ta somehow switch the cat up to a different room Shane s already like rolling his eyes at me what was the question how do you feel about your animal herding problem Oh has it has it filled the heart the the hole in your heart has it cured the depression um I m just used to having animals like I ve always in every stage of my life I ve had a bunch of animals yeah I like I love animals I love the feeling of like you re never alone they re always there they re not judging you they love you and I agree the more the merrier until you have one in a cone and then a cat that you re trying to acclimate to the rest of them and then my head kind of spirals in circles and I m like I don t know how much more of this I can take but my Rye Rye baby who s sleeping on my lap right now is approved Again by the way I don t want people to think that I m the one who s just keep keeps on getting animals the cat thing that was you yeah on accident that s like everybody s story with a cat I feel like everybody in America has a cat named garbage oh we just moved into this house and like the garbage cans we got this A A cat with it we named him garbage but ours came from an angel ours is an angel Reincarnation of another Angel garbage cat and I guess the alpacas were my fault as to what yes so you re an animal hoarder too I know how do you feel about his animal herding it s hard I would rather I feel like that isn t one of our issues what Animal Hoarding I feel like we both agree on it oh like we have other issues what are those issues let s unpack I feel like every dead may come on the podcast what else are we gon na do I think family therapy helps everyone else in relationships out there I m not a certified therapist but I do enjoy making others business my own okay let me think what was his problem what did we fight about recently oof you did tell me I needed to go to therapy I did I told him he needed to go to therapy when he started I told Chris he needs a journal I ve told yeah Chris have you found a new therapist yet oh so that s a whole like no I really tried actually because Jared had a good I m trying to make a brief Jared had a good idea on the podcast on your podcast about uh looking through my like insurance and and I like I go through Kaiser so I was like oh well look they re Kaiser and I did a nightmare too it is a nightmare and it ended up being like several like like at least a couple months of like filling out paperwork and answering calls and making appointments going back and forth and it was like such a tedious long insane process and I had to like email photos of my ID and all this stuff and then finally when I got the appointment uh it was only virtual they don t have any in person therapist which sucks for me because I don t have the best Wi Fi reception so it was like cutting in and out and I m like trying to have an appointment with the therapist you re like I need therapy about this therapy so she received none of the paperwork so I had to fill it all out as I m talking to him and he like was just like did you fill it out yet did you fill it out yet the whole time and it just got like really stressful and then he d say something and I m like I didn t hear it cut out again and it like and he just like then after I filled it out just asked re asked me all the questions on the paperwork and then it was done and I was like that was so stressful and unhelpful and I m like but let me try again and uh I missed a second appointment they were like oh since you missed a second appointment it s a fee for missing the appointment and I was like that s defeats the entire purpose of why I m doing this is to save money and it s been very unhelpful why d you miss the appointment um I had two footwork did you cancel uh I I had to add last minute it was like a thing where work needed me they didn t originally this would be a perfect segue for better help responsible and I could really use that discount code wait have they sponsored us so yes no no no no no it s one of them you don t know your response we use calm oh my God therapy okay wait Chris what was that thought because I have thoughts um for you but before I get to that uh wait can we just say this or no what I don t know I can t read your mind years ago you did a brand deal for it oh yeah go for it I don t know what you re talking about what is it so he did a brand deal first this is a long time ago for some therapy app or something um and he like showed me the video he s like tell me if any of this is boring so I start watching the video and it starts with the ad and it s like you know this app is a therapy app and blah blah blah and then it like he says like it changed my life have you seen all these like it was the best thing I ve ever done for myself and I can t even imagine that and I was like what the you ve never even you don t have that you ve never even been to therapy dude he does this to me all the time I m like wow so you really A A with that you guys oh sorry but you took it out you took it out I was like you can not say that no I don t I don t not use the products that we use but sometimes I will oversell a little bit and then that s when Lizzy will be like what and I m like oh and you did the same thing but it s only because you tricked me you know what I mean I m like oh I need that that sounds great and he likes it I ve never even smelled it I m like what I just bought that this is gon na be a moment if you guys are dragging me in a bad way oh are we yes I can already Envision what s gon na happen because as a result of this one of my favorite books on writing is by a woman named Ann Lamont and it says if people don t want you to talk about what they did they shouldn t do it well ads on this podcast then you shouldn t be smiling loves every product we have ever loves therapy loves therapy hey no I I tried I really did try and I don t I don t want to sh I don t know you loved therapy when you did it I I yes for the time being I was going through something like very specific so right help for that but then when I got into like regular life after the hurdle I didn t really know where to start and she didn t really have any helps help in prompting it and Shane s his thing would be like bring up and I m like bring up what I don t know well okay before we let me go jump back into this chapter Chris I m proud of you for trying to do therapy let s try again yeah you can t just give up after your first try well no I didn t I mean as you know I had a therapist before that an in person therapist that I went to for a long time who was amazing and by the way I was gon na say when you were saying that I ve been to therapists a lot in my life and a lot of them them were just very unhelpful until I found one that I clicked with that changed my life and like saved my life right so I would like if the one you went to wasn t helping I d strongly encourage to like try to find one that clicks with you because that s really important and I think that s the issue I have with a lot of aspects of my life like I would love to find an editor too but going through the process of finding that right editor seems worse than actually doing it or like I could do seven scenarios like that in my life currently see I totally get that but I also think at the end of the day when it comes to like mental health you can get bogged down and they re like oh but that s a nightmare starting the process as a nightmare but it s like it s always going to be a nightmare until you just A A start it yeah and then the second you started it s like unraveling they re essentially typically like you re unboxing so much and then if it s not a fit then it s starting over really does feel like a well okay here s my and I think this is what you were trying to you started getting at the reason I brought up therapy to you is because you are not like a typical damaged mentally ill person such as the rest of the people in this room and specifically Riley oh very good she s so sweet he s sleeping gosh we should have lowered the angle I m not you re not married sorry when you said lower the angle it like triggered me because of my nightmare um no so you you don t have like a bunch of trauma and a bunch of past like all that stuff right but you do have issues in the present day that you don t know are issues because nobody around you is telling you it s an issue and then I come along and say hey I think this is an issue and how would I bring that up to my therapist if I don t know that it s an issue exactly which is what I m telling you so now here so your issue um is because we talked enough about mine your issue is you have a very big temper I do have you have a lot of rage and it s very fast it comes out of nowhere um and and yeah you can t take any sort of criticism you turn into a fight I think I ve gotten better on the criticism I think with criticism I ve gotten better but I am very strong willed no I am you don t think so really no what do you mean is this a test are you touching it right now because I am triggered and I would say I know the traits that you mean but I will also say I have come such a long way since dating you like I really was a monster maybe when I met you wait really I would say in terms of like I think you brought me a long way in like my emotional Journey my emotional availability you don t think so no I m just kidding no you have I think you ve changed like you stopped me in a life path and like helped redirect me in a way for the positive I think to be more generous to be more open to be more emotionally available to change my priorities yeah and maybe I yes and you changed me too so I don t want to sound one sided and I would be dead without you but what I will say he always says is oh my God imagine imagine what imagine me alone how about Shane the other night talking about if he ever died that he wants me to date again yeah I m like why are you telling me this what prompted we re watching a movie about it so you don t really love him exactly if you re not haunting him from Beyond that s not real love well no I told him I was like I never want you oh my God it was a A A Lindsay Lohan movie oh my God that scene of her with a horse um you guys know that s me with milepacas um oh yeah I did see that scene I m gon na go train get some firewood right now and then she eats A A I love her she was so good in uh Freaky Friday anyway your rage so I think that s the thing is yes you ve changed so much as far as being generous and like being less like narcissistic or whatever not narcissist but you know like yes the trades yeah so you ve done better with that but I think because of that I think you have all this rage Brewing I mean we haven t tapped into that I wouldn t disagree and I would say no I m serious that s why I started meditating and I think meditation has brought me a long way I also think I get frustrated when I haven t had time for me and I feel like a lot of mornings recently because our lives have been so chaotic with getting alpacas and then getting a cat and then having Riley get spayed or neutered or whatever it is for her gender um I just like a lot of the mornings are me running around feeling like a chicken with my head cut off for an hour and then I m like oh I ve got to finish all of this work and then I don t have time to work out and then I just like I m short fused there s thing and that is where I m bad if I don t okay achieve what I want in my day okay I become very short fused okay uh there was a day where I got up early for no reason it was really weird and I did all the things right like I helped you and I fed the dogs and I did all those things and but you still had a lot of anger that day one specific I think that s a cop out no that was like I think the rage comes from somewhere else and I want to know where it is because your childhood was perfect so where is it coming from hmm you know what I mean you re right no I don t know I don t know because I do some days I m just on edge and you get the brunt of it because you re here you re here yeah and I think I because my husband says the same thing he s like I get the nastiest side of you and it s like you re goddamn right you do and if you can t handle that you don t get the rest of it either and what will trigger you into a spiral like that oh anything could it s literally anything because I m that that s probably why you and I are friends because I m just sitting here like wow that sounds a lot like me that s probably why I like him but no it can be as simple as like my friend James playing with the A A center console in my car because it s broken don t A A touch it it s broken like don t you think and I did dumb A A A A all the time where it s like anyone in the world could be like Lizzy have you ever had a thought but when one person does one thing it s like put it together figure it out and it s like I don t know where that comes well some of my aggression that I find fun though like I am entertained by a little bit of it I m saying stems from for example playing mafia or playing a game where it requires some there s a part of me that also enjoys being feisty a little bit aggressive and like getting under somebody s skin that s why didn t we talk about this last time you always start a fight before we have sex oh where it s like we should probably do it right yeah I ll walk up the stairs and on the way to the stairs you ll be like well you re just gon na leave those dishes in the A A sea and I m like I ll do them and then A A weirdo and then he s looking for the lube or whatever and he ll just he ll just be like he s like so like you know are we gon na watch him Lindsay Lohan movie tonight or not like just you know and I m just like why are we doing this why are we doing this so I think your rage combined with your needing to be angry during intercourse there s something wrong bro it s like maybe your parents were fighting and like to dry it off you re just like beating it all like you re good I m just like I can t hear it because everything else is great like I don t know maybe that s it Chris agrees no no no no I only like me too no I only witnessed my parents fight once in my life oh that s crazy yeah I really only heard and then like walked down and saw one fight so definitely what did it look like was it darling it was over yeah I can picture it like I could picture it like it was yesterday it was over Christmas my mom was mad because my dad was like cheaping out on something and she wanted to do more or get more of something and he was saying no and and so they were like having a brawl in the basement but a bro you need to be more specific yeah rumors were they throwing hands that s what that sounded like no do you know what a brawl is no I guess not so they were having a heated respectful they were just yeah they were just doing what we do every day about can you not fight every day and then sometimes my fights that I pick aren t real though they re like fun no here s the thing what he ll do is he ll start a fight that s fun right he ll just you know like you hate me or like whatever and then I ll start joining in on the fight and then I ll start poking too the second I poke back he actually gets mad and now it s a real dead pen and then I m like you you re crazy no I m not look at him not being able to take criticism do you like makeup sex is that why you fight like is that no he likes heated like Angry sex yeah I m learning yeah like with your grinder hookups did you like fight with them you should be like well this is really out of my A A way there s so much adrenaline that you don t you didn t have to it is what it is he needs the adrenaline whoa whoa yeah my rate just went up that was a breakthrough but what does that mean what does that mean you re right because it s never just like an in the moment like oh like romantic we love each other there is is an adrenaline something on your end whether it s a fight whether it s like a you know we re in a car no sometimes when you give me gifts oh my God this is not good for you this story no maybe don t he gets very excited a lot of I do I get that like excited yeah oh yeah I could get hard right now thinking about him giving me presents Laughter wow that just editing note take that and put it somewhere on your Instagram somewhere we don t edit that hard over here okay okay because that s that was a moment I pissed Joe off because like like this is this is A A up which I won t hate that I shared it so I m gon na share it anyways but sometimes like if we re like in like a loving moment I will think to like I always think about Starbucks and I can t not do it and so afterwards sometimes I m like so can we go get Starbucks now and it s like I ve been pavlovianly conditioned to expect Starbucks after acts of love no Joe Knows he ll like he ll even bribe Starbucks sometimes beforehand won t he yeah I bribe like thumbnails I ll be like oh like you know if I it s not even sex though if I need something I ll just like throw in like well do you need help with the thumbnail I don t be like oh A A yeah I do and he ll be like what I had something to say too bad all of us no and every single one of them I know we like fight on this podcast but I do think like other forms of media that we participate in doesn t show this element like you know so I think it s good to like highlight fights or things that we fight about or have it s real I think some fights are okay like you know as as a married woman sometimes I think to myself like is this fight worth having and then it s like if it s not I ll get twice as mad at Joe if he s the one who s picked it I ll be like this is a waste of all of our A A time and then I can t handle it like Joe the other day I was trying to put the dishes away and I was like are you A A broken you re in here yelling at the dishwasher you need to calm the A A down and it s like girl you were in another room none of that was your business and it s like who s the problem now Ryland I am so excited because today s podcast is sponsored by loamy and I ve never been able to compost before

outside Lizzy was dead set sold on doing an episode outside after the sun had set what is this voice I m sorry what isn t that nasty it s the way he talks to me on the podcast what are you talking about it s crazy right you re doing your like entertainment voice yeah are you but it s like this this dumb A A was dead set Lizzie Gordon uh oh wait you have to keep doing it wait Dude tell your story in that place okay three two Elizabeth Gordon three two so these editors know oh I m sorry you guys aren t professionals at all I mean three two you Elizabeth Gordon came to Colorado and while filming up cupping well upcoming no um she was literally saying we got ta do an episode outside in front of the Christmas lights and I said if you ve been outside at night I brought a jacket that s what you said but go outside I went outside and I thought it was great I thought it was nice outside I was like oh so crisp so nice whatever while you re dragging me so much don t you think we should drag you a little bit I can t be like I ve got a race where are we gon na drag him where is he going how are you gon na do that well what are aspects of the our relationship that are your problem in what am I a problem oh you re not perfect I m not you re a great boyfriend I m not saying I m not here s what I m saying though a few years ago when you told me that I needed to get therapy because you didn t know how to deal with my issues right I went to therapy and I feel like I fixed most most of them um so yeah I m just expecting the same return but anyways uh what are my what are my current issues um you get mad if I call you out on something no it s the way you do it so here and here s an example if he wants me to do the dishes I keep using dishes as an example but if he wants me to do the dishes instead of saying hey it would really help me can you do the dishes I d be like oh my God yes but instead he ll go he ll like say to Riley he s dead gon na do the dishes or he ll or he ll be like so you get so are you gon na go do the dishes like it s like we re sick you re a sick twister you can not act like I m sick here I can you ve done crazier things no yes no every day my husband s not here to attest to it I ve gotten better I will say because no when we got Riley adding the third dog was difficult while she was really in her puppy stages and I because I m up in the morning time and you did come up with Solutions you were like well let her just get on my schedule and then I ll deal with but I was like the other dogs are already on my it just went wouldn t work so it I got better at instead of being passive aggressive when going to bed asking you to take out the dogs like in a weird way now I would just be direct and say hey can you take out the dogs while I go get ready for bed yeah I think that s something that s hard because I have expectations and I feel like I can get caught up in my expectations and then if my expectations aren t met by my husband he s in A A trouble but he also can t read my mind because he s like but he should be able to he should be able to he should be A A anymore Amanda doesn t A A read my mind you re speaking to yourself because she s me in the relationship no but I think I like everybody has that same thing in a relationship it s not there s not just one person with expectations everybody has expectations well the problem is articulating that to your partner because if you re passive aggressively pissed that someone s not doing something that you haven t asked them to do that they re not aware of doing it s not fair I agree and our life the things that we do naturally are just very different from one another like neither of us are less helpful but it s just in different regards so sometimes I feel like I m not getting enough of what I want help with I just love the Chris s little looks to me because I don t know if it s to check my camera or if it s like he like gives me these little looks like I m on your side Christmas like I d never do that to you baby and I give him a look back like thanks well on your side I mean I will say like we ve talked about this on your podcast like I don t know if it s a cancer thing I don t know what it is but like we re both like kind of like emotional and similar in a lot of ways and like whenever you say something you re like oh yeah that s me in the relationship sometimes you say things and I m like that s me too so I just relate that s all well good luck to both of you put it back on mute I d say overall you re a great boyfriend I rate you out of oh my God he recommends you all the time yeah I d recommend you to anyone after me would you ever yeah of course what do you mean can t fall in love with anyone ever again if I ever God forbid something were to go wrong you d want him to date again yes I want him to find out see that ll never work for me if I die and Joe moves on I want all of you to say something A A up to him because that is A A up you re mean that s awful no it s not he s got to live on this planet what about my memory he does not need a person that s not me that has not happened okay I real what oh I was just thinking because you but while we were taking a pee break Lizzy brought up uh something about her husband snoring and then I had something to add on to that so Joe scream snores and won t wake up and he also like you so this is similar Joe will come to bed late as A A and I m like Rylan I go to sleep when the Sun goes down it s like well I m done and I like fade into a little puddle in the bed and he ll come in at like four o clock in the morning blow his nose like a A A Steamboat horn he couldn t do that outside that s what I m trying to say how A A dare you you come in at four o clock in the morning and blow your noses hard as you can in our bathroom that s in our bedroom what the A A are you thinking so I woke up last I wake up every night he does it I wake up every A A night and then I just sit there stewing in Rage for minutes trying to go back to sleep but I m not allowed to listen to a podcast or anything to like infiltrate my brain thoughts so I m just spiraling in this rage awake for hours thinking why would you do that why would you come in and it s like like that s the sound of the A A nose blow so you want a divorce and he can t date he s dead to me yeah you do the same thing but with your phone flashlight it drives me bonkers like there s nothing in this world that makes me more upset I ll A A because okay I have two problems you come to bed really early there s this thing my body has a clock if Shane s not in bed by am you re out I wake up and then if I look over and he s not there then I start worrying and then I can t go back to sleep what does that mean you think I m dead down here I don t know like he s A A dead the dogs am and then I m pissed off at you because you re not in bed and it s your fault because I am awake I know like it s it sounds crazy but it makes me mad because then it disrupts my sleep and I m like just be in bed by am I m not and then then Joe comes in and he faces me and scream snores and he ll come in with his flashlight and he s like well it s dark and I was like well then put the flashlight away from anyone s face like at your side pointing down there s enough light for you to get to bed just get in it I do no you don t I do then why do I have to pull the covers over my eyes because you re dramatic no I m not dramatic and you re not sensitive to light anyways so he uh he always gets mad at me for snoring and then he s like I don t snore I don t snore well yesterday he started snoring so I filmed it I m gon na need to see the video with this is this me fake news hahaha yeah so there you go oh my God that is so funny Joe whenever I wake up I m like well you were snoring and I screamed Joe and I m shaking your A A body and you don t wake up because I m literally like Joe Joe God damn it my dog s sleeping sorry but that s how violently I m shaking this A A and nothing changes it s crazy but he s always like prove it so I recorded it the other day and I played it for him he goes huh I honestly can t believe that was me I feel like you dubbed it he s a great editor he s put that in the Final Cut Pro I do feel emotionally manipulated by that edit you have to say yeah thank you Lizzy Chris am I the only one who thinks it s cute one of my boyfriend s you re A A up you need to find a codependent meeting yesterday it s like a sleep machine for you yeah there s no photo evidence it s fake news because our room s Dark As A A put a flash on this A A oh that s you that s Joe or yeah that s yeah and that s it on a mild night that s mild okay I ve had enough of that I ve had enough of that um okay Chris so does your boyfriend try to fight with you for fun like what s do you relate to any of that I mean he never picks small fights I I think like playfully sometimes like not like uh but it doesn t real fight well no my fights aren t meaning to be real but then it will strike a chord and then sometimes it will become real that has happened but yeah I mean that we had do like say playfully mean things sometimes yeah yeah but I was related to that I mean I felt justifiable in my like quick rage the other day I don t know if we should get into our fight but so I just also wanted to tack onto this like we don t have like violent sex I don t want you know like your parents watches like we re not we re not we re not beating this I m not beating the A A out of you and like you know no we re not doing that no I mean if you want to let me know listen it s all fun and games until somebody tells me to relax whatever we ll we ll move on what okay you put in the document that I guess Jennifer Lopez is taking Ben Affleck s last name yeah and she s saying she s gon na still publicly be known as Jennifer Lopez yeah it s the right thing to do romantically to take so she s gon na be Jennifer Aflac yeah but I don t still say it like that so the question is there s multiple parts to this did you take Joe s last name legally um no but physically I carry it with me it s a great burden yeah I branded it my girl s a lawyer got home okay um and what are we gon na do well my last name is fake and that s what so that s why it s a multi hyphenate like your last name s fake so I m not taking it so are you taking my name no and then what name will the baby take because our baby s not taking us baby s last name that s a big deal wait why no why don t you want his name no it s a fake glass my name no he s not care our baby isn t carrying on Dawson because there s no Family Ties I think I misunderstood he s talking about your name bro oh I m and my rage is it Shane not you oh okay he s asking why am I not Shane Adams now or Shane Dawson Adams yeah um because Adam s Dawson sounds better Shane Adams but then that s sad Shane Adams doesn t ring I don t think Shane Dawson you could be Shane Adam Dawson I guess I just don t care about it Ryan yaw like I m not like I ve never sat there and been like what like what what is my last name gon na sound like in this like I m just like you ve never done about a wedding no can I throw you guys a wedding she keeps saying that she ll just throw like she ll plan everything we don t even have to know we ll just show up here s the thing yeah we we do and we re not gon na talk about this because people are so annoyed by hearing about this no that s all the questions on the Q and A s when are you finally gon na marry me I feel like you guys have so many legally binding contracts between the two of you already that you re A A married yeah but it s not my fault what you re Inseparable no I m just kidding no I would marry you you just every time we go to the planning phase you re not like but you keep shining that light in his face while he s sleeping there s a lot of like awkward family weird things I don t like attention I mean it is weird it s like how do we I want everybody to be happy and have fun and feel ultimately the days about us not everyone else is what I think but we ve got to figure it out before we I know we ve done this conversation so many times but we do have to figure it out before we have kids I mean I always thought it would be cute have our baby involved in the wedding we can get legally married before if you if you need that I mean but I think it would be cute and also like I feel like once we have a kid all the other stuff isn t gon na matter anymore to me I m not gon na care I think you guys are already spiritually married I don t think you care now about the actual physical wedding not no married yeah like when you have a kid you stop caring about like is this person gon na be mad at this person is this person like this because when you have a kid it s like everybody shut the A A up this is my baby and I m protecting him or her or that preach so I don t know all right well do we want to jump into the Instagram questions or do you want to revisit what we said we were going to do last year on the podcast and see if we accomplished it what do we do what d we do what are you talking about we talked about what we wanted to accomplish this year I haven t thought Chris yet Laughter there s still time okay on this podcast months ago you said you wanted to go to Japan this year oh I did specific very specific yeah I was going to take that to Japan Japan wouldn t let me in I was talking to her it s not personal they weren t letting a lot of people in they ve just reopened travel to China to Japan but I was trying I was going through a an agent and she said they re not doing any Japan travel so now is not the time to book and then I completely forgot Paris Hilton goes early every week yeah I mean in my fragrance no I m not because God damn it might be different when you re flying in private probably um okay you said you wanted to work out five days a week I m doing it really like four to five sometimes I take a week off that s intense I try to do four but five is a lot it makes me happy okay I was trying to make him collapse um participate more in my sobriety you said you were currently fast and loose yeah no I am participating more in my sobriety I go to a lot more meetings and then um you said that we wanted to do our Christmas movie I wrote a script yeah I read it I loved it really good I loved it and Shane gave Lizzy like well you asked for yeah I walked into what felt like a serious conversation I was like oh wow alone but no but you re acting like I was I wasn t being mean no you re no you re I would want your input and that s why Lizzie actually wanted you to read it and give your input as well and Lizzy was laughing out loud at your suggestions to for tweaks they killed me yeah I feel like literally I feel like like we have very similar comedy writing yeah I think that you and I have a lot of very similar interests and illnesses yes very very like a lot of analogous illnesses we both really like this person I am pretty great but I think that yeah we have I think a lot of our sensibilities are very similar well I hope this Christmas movie gets made dude me freaking too why don t we just make it do we need money yes how much I mean I think if it s like a harder under let s do it oh it s not really yeah I don t think we can make around I don t think we could make a good one for not in this economy Shane s pretty crafty with sets like he did well I think yeah I think we just take it there like we use a Christmas Village as as the overhead shots of the city that s literally the first thing I thought when I was watching his vlogmas I was like this works as an exterior and I think as long as it s really funny you can get away with some of the production yeah and I think we could get a lot of things for free but like as a person who s done a lot of like Scrappy filmmaking like this is a A A nightmare and as a person whose dream it is to be an actor I want that set life experience why do you guys go fund me well first we re gon na pitch it around and see if anyone will take it if no one will take it then we ll go into how are we gon na make this on our or why don t you do a GoFundMe to get the hype going and then once you get a bunch of gofundme s hopefully sippers out there then you can go to these places and be like yeah we don t A A need you and then they ll want you more well you know what I think then we got to run a GoFundMe campaign have you ever done that no it s a A A nightmare just so drop your venmo mine was he won t let me I ve been asking for two years it s so tacky well it s not tacky for some people for you it would be tacky rude you re fine that s what he says about everything I do uh for me well Shane said for me find you an editor and I mean well no I m laughing because you haven t found one but then I see what you re about to say you are the the one I am the editor and you re amazing I m the editor now yeah I I think this entire year I ve edited my Vlogs yeah and you re so good I watched your Christmas Vlog yesterday and I was like or the day before and I was so excited and I was like oh my God he s like it s so nice that I don t have to edit these yeah it was a good one too it was really good you know how nice it was when I have to say that no she texted me which is like a frequent comment and I think she was genuine about it she was like I smiled through the whole thing and I was like I did it warmed my little heart no it was one of my favorite Vlogs that we ve made in a long time it was just cute and full of Christmas spirit um so I am still looking for an editor it was no I liked it I know just the way you said it all right I said stay consistent which I think I did I still posted a lot of Vlogs this year a lot of podcasts this year I really did stay on it what I didn t accomplish is what I set out to do is a live show there s still I don t know if it s ever in our future let s do it stop being such a A A the Parker PACE Center yeah let s go well why don t we re going back to LA for a while why don t we do one in L A isn t La the hardest place to sell yeah so let s do it in Parker where hopefully people will show up yeah Parker loves you guys it s honestly like being here it s like am I like with a A A group of astronauts returning from space it s like we pull up somewhere and everyone s like thank you for your service welcome back it s so amazing YouTuber um okay and then yep those were my things Shane you didn t really give us anything you just said I m looking most forward to this moment in the present I didn t say that you did jokingly because I kept trying to Circle back to your resolutions and you didn t really give us anything well no I think I said that I wanted to make stuff right you made a lot of stuff this year you did make a lot of stuff she just said that you made your podcast you made a whole series your whole last series is out oh yeah no yeah I ve been trying to get an unlisted link even though it s out tomorrow but I need to A A see that A A do you know that my whole world shuts down until that A A comes out and it is a mind A A that comes out at p m for a person like me for me instantly right now she literally last week canceled the dentist appointment because you were during the time that she has swear to God because I think it s part of my like ADHD where it s like no I ve got something to do at PM and everyone s like what do you have to do it s like Dawson s releasing part two and part three is some of your best work I really I do think yeah rub it in because he s seen it yeah Chris and I wouldn t know I see them all wow in real time wow the perks I wonder if I could even handle that though what I don t know like I could I could combust like when you were working on your first palette I think we went out to lunch one day and he like said the name of it and I was like I can t know that oh that s too much for me to know and it s like there s no one in my immediate vicinity who I could say that to who would be like I m off to tell but it s like I can t stand knowing a secret like that like yesterday I did a work exchange for my storyboards because it doesn t matter I had to sit somewhere while someone like these guys live painted me for like five hours were you naked no A A I m wearing a sweater and I m like watching Netflix on my phone I ll show you the pictures I look like I m on drugs but anyway I go like oh but he s like I was like what do you do for a living he goes I m a ghost painter I was like huh so he paints something and then another man puts his name on it and then sells it and I was like I can t handle knowing that like I can t handle knowing that there s a man who has a secret that dark right now in this world but I also need to know who the A A he is like right now and he s like I can t tell you and I was like I m gon na die sitting here and even knowing that this exists I get that way about specific things like if I find something out that is like weird that nobody else would care about I like feel like I have to tell somebody oh yeah I know a couple of them right now yeah we never will we ll go to our grave with it like right now all I m thinking of are like all those little things that were kind of Secrets and like I got one a couple years ago and like the running joke is like I would just text my other friends like should I tell so and so I know the secret because it was like about someone that we all know in common my problem is when it s more General and it feels like a scam you want to like do it just to the world but you can t like take the karma of actually outing the thing itself although I wan na out all the things it eats me inside it kills me like right now I m like don t say it hold it back hold it back you know something I found that was a weird I guess superstition about myself the other day because Shane called it out what when the air conditioning he I was pushing it down and it was at and I was like no you psychopath we can t have the air at oh yeah your numbers thing yeah there s your OCD there s no world in which I could ever have a heater or air conditioning at I would feel like I m going to die what do you need it at no just not or oh what s and what s wrong with too close to you what what are you gon na do when you are oh it s over no that s when you get a new boyfriend oh oh nobody else does that it s like it s why there isn t floors and buildings it s like isn t that unlike very specific but it s not because it s it s everywhere but there s actually a th floor but see that s like completely mainstream so I don t think the air conditioning should be any different I don t think it should be there quite frankly this is a slippery slope what are you talking about I mean like if you re acting like I m gen Z right now I mean you re acting like you re gen Z right now I feel like I m watching a gen Z tick tock okay guys do you ever not go to moving on moving on um New Year s resolutions are our Instagram q a okay bring out the questions bring out the questions yeah we should do the New Year s resolutions way later bro okay bro I love that some of them you crossed out that s so mean somebody just had more stuff on gay culture I don t know what that means I crossed it out yeah you re not you didn t cross that one out oh more stuff on gay culture what does that mean I don t know maybe that we don t talk enough about it we don t know a hot take I think gay guys are really represented oh my God don t get me started well I don t wan na I don t want to offend a movie okay it s Bros it was awful I m not saying it on your behalf I m thinking on my behalf I paid for it I supported the gay community I just thought it was awful it fluffed if Chris is saying that who is like so excited about it it s bad I know but so many people work on the movie so I feel about saying that okay you re right I think they re afraid to give gay people notes but it s like they shouldn t be they should get a gay executive and like have them tear it apart um okay somebody said okay how did oh oh okay how did Jeffrey s announcement of quitting YouTube affect you guys uh don t don t quit Millennials still watch how did it affect me I just more felt well in that moment so we were we didn t have a plan Chris came over we were filming random dumb A A all day and then I was like oh I have this palette that would be fun to show but like whatever so then yeah ask Jeffrey and then he s like you should come here blah blah then later that night is when he facetimed me and was like yeah I m quitting YouTube should I say it in the series and I was like I like thought I was gon na throw up and then I was like Chris grab a camera let s just start filming so all that was real but it only affected me and like I feel sad that YouTube is kind of feeling like but maybe the way that like TV felt when the internet came kind of like Oh wait we re still over here I feel like YouTube is that because everybody s watching Tick Tock and this and that and I am unable to get into that stuff for some reason my brain just doesn t care about Tick Tock or that stuff so yeah it is a little sad um but I don t think I ll ever leave because where else would I post an hour long thing not that you have creative control over yeah I I had somebody in our life come up to me today and say do you really think YouTube is dying and I was like who said that well CeCe oh and she was like yeah I was watching Shane s second episode and I thought all I watch is YouTube like I listen to podcasts all day I like sitting down and watching something that s long form I hope you guys never leave doing YouTube because it s something that like you can sit down and enjoy where you don t get other places and I was like well I don t think people are going to fully leave YouTube I just think it s not what it once was and you can yes say like somebody got less popular but there s also Tick Tock that went boom and I don t think the younger Generations that were previously coming because I think for you for example as you were growing up I think you would capture the younger generation and they would add on to your audience whereas now I think that younger generation is going to tick tock you re maintaining the older audience I see for my analytics like when I first started YouTube it I did have that to whatever range and now my whole range is to and then my second is the to and so I don t think the younger people are coming to YouTube and then I just think because of that a lot of creators create differently and on the other platforms um so it is sad but I still love YouTube as well I mean I ve just I ve I ve come to just appreciate the audience that s there like yeah I m not getting million views anymore but the people that are still there the couple million few million whatever they re so nice and so excited about it and they watch it like I ll look and like I ll look at the retention like they watch it they actually care and I m like okay I d rather make stuff for people who are excited and invested than million people where most of them either are hate watching or they re watching because it s popular or you know whatever and what s more interesting to like well for me I feel my content is better than it s ever been I feel like I care more about it and I feel like when I was doing really well on YouTube like that was very fun and exciting but I wasn t as fulfilled making the videos as I am now yes I felt like I was on a treadmill and because it was like concept videos I was always chasing what s the concept for this week what s the concept and now I film moments in our life that genuinely mean something to me and I love like the audience that s there that enjoys watching that but I do think it s sad that Jeffrey but he doesn t create in the way that you create like he he s a creative but I think he puts that energy into his business like Cosmetics business more than like editing a video and he s just not getting that fulfillment I did love Jeffrey s concept content though oh he s one of the big creators that I genuinely Miss watching yeah me too I mean and that s the thing and that s why I was trying to I was hoping the series would end with him changing his mind like I had a whole idea for the ending and like whatever and it didn t happen and um but yeah I mean he s doing his thing on Tick Tock and he figured out a new thing that he enjoys doing on Tick Tock which is working because I don t think he enjoyed doing the trends so now he s just doing shorter versions of his makeup tutorials and they re doing really well so yeah um but yeah I just can t think in short like I can t think a minute long like I have I just did a minute spot and I m like this is hard how about my snapping at you oh Shane it was like that s it that s the beginning I said yeah because during the break Rylan yelled at us well no I yelled at Lizzy because she s driving me nuts no you directed at all of us no I didn t I ll explain what happened whoa I said I ll take it listen Shane s camera died and ran out of memory I couldn t find another memory card so I had to import footage and then my computer was full and the only way you can do all that is to be nasty and the whole time I m running around the whole house trying to get this podcast back up and running Lizzy just keeps screaming did you leave all the windows open negative degrees in this A A right D in here right that s too cold it is not in here either you A A liar your thermostat might be set to but it is negative feel my nose it feels wet and you wanted to record my nose in the degree weather outside I want a lot of things but that doesn t mean they re good for me and she wouldn t stop and I said I m trying to get us back up and rolling I ll turn off the A A air shut up no shut up no what you said exactly what you said he said Lizzy screamed uh what are you doing cause it s been it s been a long time it s been a long time a million things to get the podcast back up and running he yells I m doing a million things for us so that we can get them so that we can finish the podcast so he directed it to us right and what I said to them was this is it see here s the thing he s running around doing a bunch of A A that he didn t ask for help we don t know what he s doing and you guys could even help probably anyways because we don t even know what he s doing right yeah so it s like so then why is he directing it at everybody and making it cold no I wouldn t have snapped to anyone because Lizzie wasn t screaming about the temperature I was like if you re A A cold get up and turn off you re scared but I would like to feel how warm your nose is if it s not this A A cold I m hot you might be sick I m not sick I wouldn t have snapped you know all of us sat here and said we all probably have covered well no I did not say that Chris was like I m pretty sure I have covet I ve been licking a lot of doorknobs in public and we were like Chris no you heard him say it I was the only one double Mast on the plane Chris wears a mask everywhere yeah he s safe double masked oh so what was your biggest takeaway from the series with Jeffrey uh my biggest takeaway like what or it could be anything what s your what s your sentiment now later oh man after the fact um and no spoilers shut up but this episode goes live it s been out for two weeks you A A ruined part three for me right now I will lose it uh it was very emotional I mean I after we watched it I like cried because like I usually don t watch things all the way through until I m done editing them and then I ll finally watch them I ll like watch chunks so I watched the whole thing all the way through and yeah made me cry I don t know it was very very sad uh ending of a chapter but also like it was one of those things where we started filming something stupid that like I didn t we had no idea what we were doing and then you know God the Universe I believe in God but you know the universe whatever you believe in really guided the A A out of it like oh took control fully took control of it and turned it into something where I can t imagine not having made this like I don t think I would be uh I think it would make me less of a person to not have posted this so so yeah I m just really grateful that the Universe guided it and then we made it the way that it all came together was honestly so insane because yeah you were literally just let s pick up the camera and film something today a and because you had thought oh I could show this palette it turned into this whole other ordeal and it felt like and let me just say the universe is crazy too because there was one other idea that I had if the palette didn t work if Jeffrey if Jeffrey would have been like no don t show it I had an alternative idea for something to show that I m working on and every time we ve tried to film because last year we tried to film like me talking about this project I m trying to do and it was out of focus the whole time so I couldn t use any of that footage and then this year we started filming and I and then Chris is like the camera just died and I m like okay it s a sign it s weird every time I try to talk about it what is it I mean now I m afraid to even talk about it because I feel like I m jinxing A A and you know now I need to know but I also can handle knowing you ve really complicated my life now Shane I m sorry wow what the A A man well I have to go well if you haven t already watch all three parts of Shane s latest series it is fantastic I love going on the whole ride throughout the duration of all of it because I was there I was there I didn t help at it but I was there while you edited and now that it s out it s just so fun and rewarding and I m so happy for you and I do think it s very incredible thank you you re welcome and but he also talks that way about all of our sponsors uh Chris asked an interesting question in the break he asked what it s like when we have Angry sex oh I was just wondering something you want to delve into what s better when you give me a gift sex or when I start a fake fight sex oh yeah is there a difference yeah are they exciting well you re I mean you re more giving if there s a gift involved wait but when it s angry sex like it you said it s not like abusive but is it aggressive in any way or is it like they re just like why d you go find it now Chris because I love sex he might want to taste wow he s sick the boy needs Jesus I love sex I come from a German family and sex was not a thing that is not like shunned in Germany like it is in America oh yeah you should take this open conversation to Germany then yeah you ve turned on all of our dances laughs um no we don t want to have sex with Chris no we re never welcoming a third and no hate to those who do oh please you would be even I m against it but you would be even more against it wait but you didn t answer the question what was the question about the aggressive side sorry uh yeah no I mean I guess we can get kind of aggressive well it s more me getting aggressive with you but it s not like dangerous this is making Lizzy uncomfortable I have to go I mean I feel like somebody s big as me and somebody s small as you it s even if it s not on purpose it s aggressive like I feel like it s dangerous in general so sometimes I think if Joe died on top of me I d be A A yeah like I was like well I can t move this body it s like that Stephen King book and you d be blamed A A yeah I just have to wait it out Gerald s Game were there any other Instagram questions that you wanted to respond to before we leave the people before we exit the chat Oh Oh I thought this one was fine oh change my smile Queen uh she said if Shane had a cameo in your guys s Christmas movie uh what character would he play oh I have some ideas do you want to go well he read the script let s let him go first you go first I feel like my character s out there yet I think that s kind of true but I also thought you could play his love interest no no I can t spell that you can t are you kidding with that had a hair and your A A facial routine I told you earlier you ve been looking A A good don t say that it s not real no it s real sometimes I literally stop when I m watching the Vlog and it s like does that mean I m getting fat this is a new era no there s something like there s something like nice and relaxed and natural and lovely and a glow whoa but honestly thank you Lizzy I wish I mean can you give me a compliment yeah I give you compliments every day yeah labor no I said the same thing to joke you say one nice thing about me no rylan s version of a compliment is just not yelling at me oh my gosh you re making me out to be a monster um anyways uh thank you Lizzy uh thank you Chris do you want a cameo on our Christmas movie oh yeah I mean of course but like you know I yeah I m trying to think I I was I didn t read it thinking anybody felt like me yeah but you know if you want to throw in you know give me something weird yeah yeah if we if we show the the callers in the opening scene I also thought about putting Joe in as the bartender yeah all right we ll find you a place for a Christmas movie that s definitely being made absolutely yeah it s not biased by someone else no what you re not I mean if not by someone else by us yeah okay sorry reverse I m freezing it s like the A A Titanic right now it s like unwell you re literally are you cold Chris yes Shane said he was cold okay I have a question side note I just thought of something I thought of an easy Cameo but I feel like I should have something a little meteor yeah uh I was like oh I could just be one of the people in the beginning of the movie not to give it away but you guys kiss like a million people yeah I could just be one of the people you guys kiss but then I started thinking when I was reading it it felt like uh you wrote it it was almost like a fantasy like you were kissing so many people see Joe doesn t like that either and he won t read the script because of it I thought it to me it felt kind of like okay remember uh Bros uh I saw a review of Bros and somebody s like it feels like Billy Eichner wrote this because he wanted to like have love scenes with a bunch of like hot guys yeah I felt like reading your script at that point I was like oh she s trying to kiss a bunch of people to be honest the original like treatment that we sent no kisses so my character had no love interests whatsoever which is why and their note was she needs one yes and it has to have that and because in my mind our relationship is the relationship of the film and it still is um so I added that in because it feels frivolous and light and fun and I don t know if you notice but every single kiss that she has is absurd and quick and that s also why I m thinking like Joe s the bartender I think the most intimate kiss would be the one between her and the doctor um but that one s even absurd and I have a real real I have like a romance Arc yeah you have a real romance are you gon na have a problem with that I was just gon na ask would it bother either of you if the other one kissed someone for a role for a movie no there s so many people on set and it s so unromantic that it s like well yeah but sometimes remember when we first started dating I was kissing YouTubers and videos and there was no downside and you didn t care no uh no you can kiss anybody yeah I mean listen like I m not a jealous person I wish you were a little more jealous but you you ve gotten there you ve gone there oh it s a battery exhausted it just went away you re kidding me it s probably still there well thank you so much Shane

have not found your A A and i m just like it wasn t like it was missing missing like it was at tsa it s got my name and my phone number on it my A A address you have to bring people up to speed because that s where we left off last we were filming our car cast mukbang episode right we drove you straight to the airport we dropped you off and so you dropped me off at the airport and i m in the line for security about to walk through the metal detector like putting my A A on the little conveyor belt and i get they got first of all let me backtrack even a little bit more the guy in front of me insecurity was acting weird as hell it was like a guy who was my age like years old but had maybe never left his house but didn t look like a feral kind of person like he looked like a normal dude but was acting like a person who had never left their house like everything seemed strange and weird to him like he had stuff in his pockets like he had a face mask in his pocket and he took it out with a bunch of other trash from his pockets and then just squatted down and put it on the floor and then stood up and then like walked away from it and it s like there s trash cans everywhere at security for people to throw away A A and he just put his trash on the floor but like squatted down to do so it was A A weird so i m on edge because this guy s being A A weird he s taking forever to take his belt off like and i m super in his business because i like my anxiety level is through the roof when people are being weird in public like that it s either a lizard person or someone about to do something that s you know not safe or risky whatever cutting in lines is fine continue cutting in lines is fine being A A weird and erratic in public in is not fine no it is scary and where where you re not past security just yet yeah and i m like what s he gon na pull out of his pockets next like why is this year old man squatting down and just putting handfuls of trash on the floor instead of going to the A A trash whatever it was weird so i m paying attention to him i get a call from joe joe says hey i have bad news i m like what i m literally like i can t be on the phone very long he goes icky hurt himself we re at the vet right now and he s getting x rays to see if something s really wrong and i m just like i have to hang up right now i m going through security so that s where i leave off i hang up on him i go through security i get out on the other side my first thought is just get joe back on the phone to figure out what the A A is going on with icky joe doesn t answer when i call because he s dealing with the vet i m so stressed out i walk away from security with just my backpack and leave my suitcase and get on the trolley thing to the gate by the time i m at the gate joe calls me back he s telling me what s going on with icky and i realize i forgot my luggage at tsa and then everyone at denver airport is like oh we can t get in touch with tsa and i m like what the A A good is tsa if you can t get in touch with them if there s a problem you know what i m saying and you re already running late because we had delayed because of filming you didn t have time to get back and fdia is a nightmare because you have to get on this underground train that goes to three different stations that are miles apart from each other and so you just have to board the plane without any of your luggage after witnessing everyone that s crazy at the airport yeah and in my mind i m like it s united like even if i were to get on another flight there s no sure chance that that flight s not going to be cancelled like so one of the flight attendants was like you could just get on the next flight and i was like can i and he was like that s true i was like i just want to get home to my dog so i m going to leave my A A here whatever so i left my A A there made a lost and found claim and uh we ll probably never see that A A again that is mind blowing because i feel like normally they do a good job the only experience i ve ever had like that is once it s already on a plane and then they know the plane s next connection so they can just reroute it where it was but yours was floating somewhere in dia there s no saying that somebody just didn t pick it up themselves i just don t know why anybody like all my makeup which sucked like all my makeup and i just bought new mascara everything from the beauty room you re in right now basically and then i had also just bought new like eyebrow stuff and new mascara which is like not cheap and then i and but the most valuable thing was actually the luggage itself which was my god mom s kissy and when she passed away it became mine so that s like an eddie bauer bag from like the early s that i ve taken literally superstitiously everywhere with me and it s gone so that s a A A i didn t know that element that s the only thing that s irreplaceable everything else i m like whatever did they give you an update have you called no they literally just got this the emails i get from them are you re never going to see your A A again they re like go A A yourself A A we don t care and and that was everybody s attitude defense it had nothing to do with the airport the only person who was kind to me was the male flight attendant that was like you can get on that like he cared like he could tell that i was like on the brink of tears but doing my best to not be obnoxious to these people because at the end of the day it is my own fault but like everybody in there was just such a A A nightmare like i went to the information desk first that was my first impulse my first impulse was like panic text ryland go to the information desk so like i m texting you which i shouldn t have been doing like i should have been focused on the moment but i was so irritated that i was like so then i like go to the information desk she goes just ride the tram like the under the trolley whatever the A A it s called she s like just write it uh all the way to where they let people off at baggage claim but don t get off stay on and then you ll get out at the other side of security and i was like are there just like terrorists abundant in this airport because if it s that easy to get through security without going through security can t you don t you think a lot of people would be like if you can just get on the trolley at the plate do you see what she s saying yes i know what you re saying because i thought you could i was like that doesn t that sound like security s gon na have a problem with that she s like no and i was like and if security doesn t have a problem with that then i have a problem with that and i would like to speak to security and let them know that you ve sent a bunch of people out of the airport and then back through without making it past tsa which is a A A problem so the guy emptying his pockets also knows the same trick who knows what he s holding and you couldn t do that regardless because now you have a dog you don t know what s going on with and it s like at that point screw the belongings i got ta get home to my newborn and i hate to say that i manifested this a little bit because i was like lizzy you re so bold you re always traveling with your newborn monster which i can t imagine doing in because it s a lot of work and it s a lot of responsibility and i am a perfect i don t know if perfectionist is the right word well no it s like i want to make sure that i yeah no no you keep going oh no i was just saying i want to make sure that i m instilling the training that i ve been working on inside of him and i don t trust anyone else to do the same quality of work that i m doing so i had said you trust your boys doing all of this i was like yeah why not yeah no i mean i still do trust them because it s not about not trusting it s about it i know you and i are like crazy parents oh yeah the second anything s going on with my dog i m like well i ve noticed that there is uh a bump thinking about forming and i shall get to the bottom of that bump before it s a fully formed thought and vets are always like how did you know and i m like i know my babies i have a couple of uh puppy updates for you as well but icky was okay is he doing fine now um he s he s limping pretty severely uh he got x rays and they don t show any breakage or any actual trauma um so they don t they couldn t give us an answer they said bring him back in two weeks if he s still limping like this but his limp has gotten better and he s putting full weight on it when he like runs but he s still limping a little bit it gets it s slowly improving what did you think happened or what did they think happened they don t know they don t know he was running around with bubs and took a like took a tumble and then started screaming is what joe said but who could ever trust me about what joe said so yeah it s uh we re going on i think this is week four but he s putting full weight on it to run that s good and i want to get into your crazy vegas weekend in just a second but i do have to talk about my hectic morning i ve become i ve started to think that i could become super mom again because riley s at a point where she has really uh taken to her training well she s taken to the dogs it s as if they formed a pack now she s no longer trying to consume rocks like it is her food uh so i m trusting her more and more and more and slowly i m like leaving her for longer periods of time or if she s downstairs and i m upstairs working it s fine because she hasn t had an accident in a long time so this morning i was like i can work out i can do the podcast there s been a million people here all week and we re leaving tomorrow but i can do this and it turns out i can t because chris is downstairs sleeping in the place where i normally record when we do virtual episodes so then i tried setting up in my office which i ve been making over for an entire year i finally made progress and the only background that works in that room is the one with my new beautiful background but i don t want to give it away before i do my offense makeover reveal and so i m in here huffing and puffing and screaming and crying because there were like these crazy light reflections so i m closing the blinds i m opening the blinds i m acting like i m going to die because the setup isn t working and i ve spent three hours doing it and lizzy goes hey ry you just need to wipe yours camera it s a little bit dirty yeah it s not a reflection it s a light halation from a smudge on your lens but then when you went to wipe it you did you just wipe it with your bare ass hand yeah but it worked look at me now i know i was like i was like when i watched you go in with your hand i was like um maybe not with your A A greasy fingers but it worked look at you you re beautiful you re a stunning boy i m tired but i am getting a little bit of relief i feel like um the end of having like an infant puppy is right around the corner so oh the sweet relief but we ve been taking all of the dogs to the vet because now we re in colorado i wanted to get like just a triple assurance that everything is good and well and i m sitting there and the vet she looks at me and says your dogs are fat they are everybody s been saying it for years no no they have not no there she go she looks and she goes i know they re like big fur dogs so i i can t really go by the the the visual but when i touch them i want to be able to really feel the definition of their ribs and she was like i can t and so i was like okay so how much do they need to lose and she goes well like five pounds and i go okay well how much did she weigh and how much does she need to weigh and she goes i guess she was like x amount and she needs to be she said pounds lighter and i was like if my dog weighed pounds less than this it would not exist so you re like joe because the vets keep telling me that bubs is fat so then bubs goes on a diet but bubs s entire world crumbles if he s not eating what he wants to eat and he becomes such a persnickety little A A that he s he like actually punishes us like for a long time he was on a very strict diet because we needed to get him down some pounds and we wound up getting him down four pounds and that was like four more and we re like i don t know if we can do this because it s like his quality of life changes he like the other morning joe so when he s fat bubs every morning is super cute he does a little wormy bowie thing like his legs are out behind him his legs are out in front of him and he like wiggles around and it s the cutest thing and he s loving and affectionate like it s the sweetest hour for bubs morning bubs is perfection he stopped being like that when we put him on a diet he started with holding his love from us he you know how he sleeps in my arms every night like we sleep like a like lovers like holding each other he want like at night time he was getting out of bed he s like A A you i m not sleeping with you i want nothing like literally so mad and then at one point it was he like broke and was just like barking at me he was like i am A A hungry you got ta A A feed me i m A A hungry i m mad like all this A A like wouldn t chill out and i was like fine A A and i took him out to the kitchen and fed him and sure enough gets right back in my arms and then the other day joe was like bubs was super sweet this morning after i gave him breakfast i was like i gave him breakfast so if it was after you gave him breakfast he got two breakfasts so like joe he s like i know you think that you can just go to the vet and celebrate with the ladies there about bubs losing weight but he is unhappy and i want him to be a happy boy like all this stuff well i had never taken something more personally it was as if she called me morbidly obese because i started like i got on the defense and i go i work out with them seven days a week and shane s like you re not working out they re exercising he s like they re not out here like lifting weights with you and i was like i know but they really in my opinion don t eat that much like it s according to what the bag says so i just took it pretty hard they re down um a fourth a cup each time they eat now and i do feel like uno is miserable so whatever it s hard it s hard it s like hard because you don t want them to be miserable but you need them to be a certain way and it s just like i i i m this way with my own self i m like damn like i really want to try that strawberry ice cream crumble cookie but i don t want to because cookies are bad for me but it s like girl i m going to die at some point in this life i m going to A A die and do i want to die snatched and miserable or do i want to die salivating at the mouth enjoying a A A crumble cookie because the answer is i want the crumble cookie i think they re somewhere in the middle you don t have to be like sickeningly fit but you can be like passing yeah i think hollywood will enjoy the crippled cookie well it s like hollywood s body standards are starving so if you don t look starving you re like i m not hot and it s like that s such a lie bro that s such a lie i mean i think confidence is a lot of it i think if you can rock your body no matter the size confidently i think that people uh are attracted to that and gravitate towards that but i do think that that has become the standard over time which is slowly like starting to reverse into toxic yeah not even in a toxic way but it s always like there s lots and lots of hurdles but while we re talking about dogs something that reminded me that i was to my boiling point with you i was ready to throw my phone through the window and never talk to you again yesterday lizzy started i have a few beeps with you and we re talking about what s going on and it s just going to be what it is what are you talking about lizzy s scream texting these are surprising conversations with here s the thing so i take photos of my puppy but i don t send every i take photos of my new puppy a day right i m not sending every single one of them to lizzie i get maybe and this isn t an exaggeration i ll go on the low end photos of lizzy and her dogs a day and at some point it s like how can i react in a way that s like going to fulfill her because it s like at some point just put it on your instagram story and i ll tap tap tap i ll enjoy all enjoy i ll enjoy and so she s sending me photos and i didn t reply right away and what got you so A A angry she got mean she got rude and she s taken a joke that she has done too many times too far and i finally A A snapped let me see if i can get that far back up no you re mad okay first of all you posted on your instagram story that your new full time job like that it was becoming a full time job to photograph riley and i comment like my response to your dm s was get a A A job that was a joke by the way i wasn t upset with you and i replied this is where the feud started because then i did reply and i said at least i put them on my story and don t send them to you individually honestly i think the feud starts with your you re upset clearly yes okay so she does send me a cute photo of icky and she goes why is my dog so much more cute than all of your dogs and i just said she s not and he goes he she goes he s cause icky s a boy and i said well then i got mad so i said borderline ugly if you ask me icky s a very beautiful dog but i was upset because this has been months a month of lizzy calling my dog an ugly foot head and my dog is beautiful and if you read previous comments of the podcast a lot of people are saying that my dog is more beautiful and i know it s a preference thing like our dogs are both gorgeous but it s obviously a joke we have beautiful akc A A certified ass beautiful dogs and you go uh riley with the foot head and i just said i m done with you until tomorrow i said i feel bad riley is beautiful she really is i m acting out because i m tired you came back to me when i sent you that tick tock of that guy and i said do you think he s gay okay i don t want to put this tick tock on the screen because i don t want to shame anyone but how did i reply to you i ve already left the text message what element has you thinking there s any chance he s straight and it s this guy like in this costume dance doing the the gayest dance in the world possibly what possibly has you considering there s a world in which he might be straight and i m genuinely curious you never replied there s a couple of things the first of which is the catholic cross in the background the second of which is how badly i want to A A him wow i m just kidding i mean you have a history of wanting to A A gay guys yeah it is because your history is loving gay men so he s probably a gay man part two of my being of elizabeth gordon so you know how she s the grammar police she s always correcting me on everything i say wrong and she calls me out and i always i m like why what s the what s the point but you know for your own good when i finally clock elizabeth gordon when i m sitting down on a beautiful weekend morning to watch and enjoy her vlogs which by the way your mom is very adorable she had a lot of punchlines that had me laughing out loud um so i m sitting there i m watching the vlog i have my coffee i m all excited and you want to hear what you said you want to hear it yeah because i spent five minutes watching you find it one pound of gear cheese one pound of gear do you understand what you just did no ghee air cheese yeah but later on in the podcast someone tells me how to say it right grier it s gouya no it s gruyere i worked at lapongo titian an austrian you told me well no because you and your mom were fighting about a different cheese no and then later on rylan don t play with me right now because there s a time stamp that i can A A show you where the other side arguably thought that that was that no and i even make a joke about how to say through the whole episode which is why the austrian woman was like it s goulier because it s like a hard cheese to pronounce also that s not a real gotcha moment one in americans do not know how to pronounce guillermo grier i am in great company and so am i with everyone that lives in was born in utah that says mountains like i do mayans okay moving on yes oh vegas the biggest event of the last week was your trip to vegas yeah i did do that i did go to vegas um joe and i went to vegas it was a trip that we had planned for june and we had to push off so we finally went we we shortened it um but yeah we went to vegas we did a horror escape room that was so A A scary like i don t know i was like i m sober like what do i do in vegas i ve never really been to vegas but i love like kitschy campy things and that s like nothing if not vegas so joe took me on a lobby tour and we went to all of the themed lobbies so that he could show me all the stupid decorations in them and i didn t realize how like funny that was until we were in a cab and the guy s like well what are you doing and joe was like well she s sober so i m showing her all the lobbies and then the taxi driver was like what i was like yeah i love the lobbies she looks like my wife is she s a special girl for all the reasons i love vegas there are things that you don t uh enjoy or i m drinking is not something you don t enjoy but it s something you can t enjoy but gambling is the other thing like if i was sober i would sit and gamble all day long and you don t do that either well the thing is like here s another like another joke is like i m super unlucky at gambling like if you want to lose sit me down next to you and you ll lose joe usually gives me bucks he s like all right go waste my money see you in minutes and i m like bye so i usually just you know lose really quickly on a slot machine and then i sit next to joe and drink diet coke but um he at one point he s like kiss my dollar for good luck and i was like that s not gon na be good for you and he puts it in and loses it all really quickly and then he goes like you re right jake s more of my lucky lady and i m just like yeah so is vegas not your nightmare because the other thing you can do is go lay out at the pool and you re also like a shaded woman i found a part at the pool we stayed at the venetian and there s um like a second pool that s uh located at a point near the building where even when the sun at like p m it still doesn t hit the chairs that are back there so it s still shaded and i actually sat out there for three hours and like read some scripts and had a really nice time sitting out there because i love the heat and food did you have good food did you already have all we went to one all you can eat buffet at the luxor and it was like quite frankly trash like it was a step right but it s like i had you know like i had a vision of something in my mind you know what i mean like i thought we were gon na like there d be A A crab legs like you got ta go to like arya or well you got ta go to one of the bougie hotels if you re expecting quality buffet i mean i don t know for a fact maybe there are some stills well there s not at the luxor i also like didn t understand the quality of hotels like because there s things that i enjoy that wouldn t necessarily be considered like a quality item so it s like when joe and i when joe was showing me the luxor lobby like i love the luxar but i love the luxar for five dollar blackjack yeah well i when he took me in there i saw that they had a titanic exhibit which i ve been dying to see because i keep seeing these tick tocks of the titanic exhibit in in nashville or in tennessee somewhere in tennessee where you can like put your hand into this water and feel how cold it was and there s like a lot of actual relics that were picked up from the shipwreck like a bunch of stuff there that i m particularly interested in because when i was a little girl like my favorite stories were the titanic pompeii and let s see the iceman and so i m one of the three well pump which pompey or titanic so pompeii was a pathetic pompei was a city that got covered in volcanic ash and lava and totally preserved when a volcano exploded mount vesuvius and then uh the iceman utsi is a is one of the if not is one of the oldest modern humans to be found and he died in the alps i think between switzerland and italy or something i m not great with maps but they found this body and they realized that it was super super old but because he had been frozen for so long there s a lot about him that you can learn like about uh he had a bunch of uh he had his axe on him he had clothes still on him he had shoes still on him his skin was so preserved that you could see tattoos on him and scars from injuries past and maybe present and you they uh the contents of his stomach had been preserved so you could even see the last meal he had but when they found him in the early s there was a lot of speculation going on about how this man came to be here and the story of these hikers that were just on a hike one day and found this body and thought it was like a modern death but it turns out to be like pre iron age or something i m wrong about all the details regardless i was lit as A A to go see the titanic exhibit and then you get in there and it s like a lot of dishes like mostly just dishes and then there s one real though like from the titanic yes i believe they re real from the titanic like dishes there s some uh currency um and but other than that it s like they have a really bad reenactment videos of just like guests that are like poorly lit and they re like i m on the titanic because i m blah blah blah like whatever but it s like so uninteresting and it s not actual facts that you give a A A about and um they give you these uh like these tickets as if you re boarding the ship and at the end you scan the qr code to see if you survived and while i was going through there i just got like super depressed because like at the end there s this gift shop where there s like paper weights that are like the oil and water paper weights but there s a titanic ship in it and an iceberg in it and i just kept thinking like is this A A awful and tacky like so many people lost their lives that night like this is a A A tragedy and you re gon na sell me a paperweight like to me it felt like the equivalent of buying a A A like twin towers and an airplane oil and a water paper weight like it s just weird yeah yeah yeah and so that was kind of a bummer but i also felt like you know that queasy feeling when you feel like there s like spirits around i felt that and then there s like one room that s just particularly chilling and sad like there s a bunch of quotes on the walls of people s last words that were remembered by survivors and like joe started like joe said his eyes were sweating and i was like crying and like i had chills all over and i felt this weird like knock on the back of my neck which probably was just my purse or something but like my purse doesn t go over my neck but it was weird like i just felt like this weird not alone feeling and then i just got really depressed that it s like these people s ghosts are maybe tied to the luxor and like carrot top like what the A A could you imagine having to haunt the luxer after going down in the titanic and one of the last times i blacked out was it carrot top Laughter dude i m not about that guy it was a pretty good show i mean what i can remember of it i like i could have been entertained by literally paint drying on a wall with the say i was in yeah um some good memories for sure i don t like a carrot top with shane we used to be pretty heavy drinkers like shane and i would go to vegas and get blackout drunk every night together and be like falling up the escalators it was pretty sloppy but it was like in the first year or two of us dating and so now we re a little a little more refined we go and we like have a drink and dinner and like go gamble until am cute so did you go to any shows yeah we went and saw cirque du soleil love the beatles one oh no katy perry next time next time we re going to do katy perry for sure because we left and we were like we should have gotten jerry joe would go to katy perry with you oh yeah he s like i would have loved to go to katy perry instead of this because he doesn t get cirque du soleil it doesn t hit for him i ve never been either well i so i ve seen like i saw like traditional cirque du soleil like the original show and then i saw the avatar one and both times i was like this reminds me of being on drugs and i love it because i m not actually on drugs so when we were going to vegas i was like baby i want to go to cirque du soleil if i can t do drugs like i want to go to cirque du soleil and we went and i was like this isn t hitting it s a beautiful show but it feels like you know they re dancing and it s a bunch of like over like overworked dancers who have had enough and there was and not only that but it s like our seats were like technically very good but for cirque du soleil like a really good seat is actually further back but you don t know that so you can see the full so you can see the whole thing yeah so i m missing the acrobats because i m looking at what s on the stage directly in front of me and i m still smiling yeah i mean i m still beaming the whole time but did you like were this closer up seats cheaper and you re like wow what a great deal and then you got there and realized no no the further back seats were cheaper so so how does this tie into charlie and dixie well charlie and dixie were in A A vegas this week for dixie s birthday she s now oh okay so she did the big hurrah there yeah so it s like i was with them my girls happy birthday dixie it was a pleasure celebrating with you

you re going to take today is little huddy landon and charlie drama okay what do you know what don t you know i know that s travis barker s son yeah landon is travis parker s son landon brought lil huddy to travis s wedding to courtney so little hoodie was at the car at the kardashian wedding of the century and lil heidi is one of the dick wigglers on tik tok he is a dick wiggler on tick tock he s also now trying to be like next gen like the next next gen emo screamo rap like i did try watching like two episodes of that hype house show and he has like that uh that like which mansion in encino is that one him yeah that he s dating so he was no he was dating charlie for the longest they ve been off again on again and then is this like hot gossip on tick tock like oh it s hot gossip for everyone like i don t know if i took this intergenerational hot goss i don t think so because it hasn t even crossed my table yet and there has been some tick crossover you want to know what i ve recently seen from tick tock yeah the pink sauce drama oh i don t even know what that is what and you re a tick tock queen well it s well the reason i found it is because it s like getting people serious views on youtube like people that like don t even have like a big following are making like pink sauce scam videos and they re getting like what the A A is pink sauce scam videos should that be my vlog hold on let me take notes it s the pink sauce girl so she like made her own concoction that was like a a bright bright pink sauce that she was like a chicken finger in and it went viral no it was for like well i guess you could put it on anything she said like you can dip your chicken fingers in it your chicken nuggets your like whatever you would use ranch for essentially okay and she like was elusive she didn t tell people what the sauce had tasted like and then when it went viral on tick tock she was like oh i m gon na start like making a business out of this so she tried as like an independent entrepreneur to capitalize on the vira virality of this pink sauce but her execution like fell flat on the floor she like was shipping it in bags and by the time the bags got to people it was like deteriorating and seeping out and molding and then she went and she tried to get this like um she like tried to get packaging for it like real packaging but all of the like calorie and health information was off like it said it had servings and it was so she got all of this backlash but i feel like she s capitalizing on the backlash like she s making apology videos but she s saying she s an independent creator and she s a mom and she s like we re working with the fda and then she s screaming that it s not fda approved and it s like really hot good drama and the reason i came across it was because inside edition do you know who that is they do like kind of hit pieces on people but it s like in a news way it s like a hybrid between like hard news and entertainment news and they ll like go investigate like they re the people that go to hotels they ll get like three hotel rooms in vegas and blacklight the sheets and see which ones are the dirtiest and then they ll confront the managers at a five star hotel and say like these sheets haven t been cleaned in four months yeah and then the managers will be like hiding and say no comment so that s how i found it and then i went on this deep dark journey of following the pink sauce girl without ever having logged onto tiktok so that s what i mean like transcending tick tock i feel like this charlie landon hoodie drama hasn t done that for me but i mean continue yeah well now i m i m obsessed with the pink the pink sauce tic tocs i literally just started looking it up into it i already did you see some of it on mute i m i didn t see any of the actual things but it s like i m seeing all these youtube videos and then like all these they re getting people views like crazy views like big channels are getting millions of views where the A A were you when i was trying to come up with content you you re supposed to be my own dad you should order it taste test it and then make your own that s parallel to it and try to get a headache already in the bag i was i was at hibachi last night and they have a pink sauce as well that they give for like their rice and all of their meats that they serve you and i was like this is A A pink sauce and it s not delicious can i i have a bone to pick i have a bone to peel it you got to pick all your bones here s the deal i feel like your house has quickly become a boys club and when the boys are in town you guys live your best lives you re having A A barbecues you guys are playing dress up you re going to A A hibachi are you kidding me okay well i would like to say shane is a better employer because he s the one doing all the styling he s the one doing all the feeding i think you and i have a good time but i m not like as uh last time i was there i was like do you want to go eat and you re like there s food in the kitchen oh because we had gotten like four things whatever that was also when riley was a puppy puppy puppy and i warned you we weren t going to be able to leave the house typically i do show you a good time the hibachi it s true happened on accident because uh we jared had wanted to go to like we went to and jared gets what jared wants and right next to it was mount fuji which is the hibachi grill that we like to go to here we like it s honestly where we went for my mom s birthday it s like a fun place to go so we can go there next time you re here i m not holding back on you thank you i appreciate that so uh rapping back to this drama that you had started oh wait yeah a little heavy little huddy yeah lil hoody landon and charlie so basically what s going on now is charlie and landon are an item huddy is butt hurt about it he came out with a song where he s like you re a homie hopper about charlie which you know truth be told she is but so is he she s back and she s probably just living her life who s not a homie hopper at but it does seem like she went from like one rising star to a bigger rising star well i don t know if it i don t know but the travis bar if your dad s travis barker it seems like you re gon na be a rising star yeah travis has already got landon collabing with mgk but it s like little huddy was collabing with mgk based off of his own dick wiggling merit oh i don t know okay so i don t know anything so right the more popular of the two boys i m scared to take a side honestly but if i wasn t that crazy yeah so but like here s the deal like honestly honestly god i m gon na really hear it for this i m sure landon s a lovely boy i m sure he s a sweet sweet boy here she goes starting drama but i got ta say as a woman who s felt like calling the police on chase hudson because he makes me feel assaulted like in a good way no like in a bad way like when i first started seeing little huddy s tick tocks i was like i called like every girl i know under and i was like don t go on tick tock don t look a little heady he s gon na give you a A A up complex about men and you re never gon na be okay you re never gon na find a good guy because you re gon na be looking for this sort of weird A A abusive dick wiggling piece of A A like that s how i feel about little honey so it s like you feel like you got assaulted without consent just by consuming the way that he like looks at a camera and like shakes his head a little bit and then goes like like all of it none of it is okay with me and none of it s okay and the no underwear the it s just all of it it s like stop it stop it um it s why i it s it gives me a really strong A A likes no like it like if that was my son i d be like no i m not paying your phone bill um and then they re like we don t need you to pay our phone bill we re gon na buy into a house and you re like okay well it s like would i take the house like there s i don t know i don t know i watched this sick twisted thing on vice the other day about a vice interviewer going to like this tick tock manager who keeps starting a bunch of different houses and i didn t realize there was like such a like toxic environment of creating houses within tick tock that is for money that is to like anti the system more for like becoming something of yourself on social media i didn t realize it was like i always knew people like the most sought after career was social media or being an influencer or a youtuber or a tick talker but now more than ever like seeing a visual representation to that she was even like well it s a big fu when you have your master s degree and you see cynthia across the street who didn t finish high school who s bought her house her mama house and it s like if cynthia can do it why can t i and it s almost like yeah why would anyone do anything else yeah it s upsetting sorry no don t be sorry no i m i as as two people who are currently making a living on social media i feel like tick tock is different i honestly feel like it is so and this goes back to like a vidcon so vidcon tick tock i think large portion or sponsored a lot of vidcon this year and i was hearing a lot of that like the youtubers with a hundred thousand subscribers were getting like huge meet and greet lines and tick tockers with million followers nobody was showing up for and i think it s because tick tock is so consumable that you re not really creating like the same sort of fan base yeah and it s like yes you can make a tick tock but is it i m not saying it s easier than youtube but it s different it s very different it s long form content versus a single joke and i do think there are some tick talkers who have an audience that gives a A A about that sends and gives a A A about them but they re a very specific kind of creator they re not like the random creator that went viral they re the creator that you know had an ounce of charisma that was intriguing and then sort of like a world or community around them that s easy to you know care about and subscribe to like i know this sounds vapid and stupid but i m thinking about to turn tony who is like he went viral because he moved in with his mom during his parents during the pandemic and his mom just started screaming at him for excessively drinking but his mom s rage at him is so A A funny that he start he he made that a thing so he started repeating the joke of it and now he s built out his thing from just his mom screaming at him to his dad loving beer bongs to his brother dropping out of college and embracing this thing to his sister being his assistant he started an only fans because he s a hot guy and now he s making millions of dollars and you know his whole family is living their best life profitable no but i m just saying there s there s a difference between what two tony s doing and somebody who s just sort of A A dancing you know what i mean like i don t give a A A about the dancer except for charlie but charlie s also been marketed out the ass like she s got a team of people behind her now and yeah she s final say on what she does and doesn t do but she s been and she created that for herself like but not intentionally by her own doing by her inadvertently yes because she was a little too young to be making the bigger business decisions but i still think she earned her spot at the table right there s something charming about her dixie and mom and dad a different point or a different angle for me is i ll see a lot of big youtube creators who are getting crazy views on tick tock but it s not necessarily translating to youtube because youtube is like slowly going down for everyone like yeah there are a few like mr beast is still mr beast is still like popping there s still a few people that are popping but it s not what it once was and it s probably due to millions of things but even then i ll go look at youtubers who are still doing good on youtube but they re getting tons and tons and tons of interaction on tick tock and it s like why isn t that tick tock audience going and consuming their long format content is it the algorithm on tick tock is it that people like consuming that person on tick tock but don t care to go search for it on youtube and that s what s like hard for me to wrap my head around it s also like the addictive it s the swipe right so it s like i swipe and now if a tick tock s taking too long to get to its point which mind you is seconds instead of seven if i m on a tick tock for seconds i m like swipe swipe swipe well it s a slot machine instead of choosing on youtube like and and and sometimes like there are people who do like long form ancient drama and by ancient drama i mean like early audis and they will do to tick tocks telling the story of justin timberlake and brittany but while i m watching that i m like just do this on youtube and see i did watch one of those on wendy i watched an iteration of it was a tick tock but it was uploaded on youtube like all the parts put together of like wendy williams timeline because what s happening with her is like hard to wrap your mind around but i understand i understand what you re saying i do think we need to move on because we have a lot to get through and we ve been stuck on this foreign honestly we don t have to cover all of this but i do think that was an interesting conversation and i m glad we had it honestly me too there was a lot i needed to get off my chest for a long time and i m glad i ve been there i also need to say like before you guys come for me in the comments like i don t think little huddy was is within his rights to attack charlie publicly or to be as butthurt as he is but oh he is publicly oh he s they re not just like writing a song just like publishing yeah like publicly shading charlie i think charlie s the only person in this scenario who i like who could be like a quote unquote not bad guy but and we ll get to this when it go the sentiment of this when we get to pete davidson but i do feel like inserting yourself publicly in drama might be like a short shot of i know it s like toxic and it like while it s like in the moment it also i think gives people a lot of like um i i think it gives them something because of the amount of tension that s attention that s coming at them do you know what it is like gives them something positive or negative like what do you mean a positive feeling in the attention although the attention negativity is somewhat negative so if you re on the positive or the negative end of the feud which i m sure it shifts depending on who says what when yeah he s definitely on the negative end so and then if charlie is taking the high road and not responding i honestly think that s the way to go the winner mental health over time because yes little huddy might be getting like more interaction than ever and there s probably like receptors in his brain that feel good about the attention he s getting although negative but i think long term it leaves a bad taste in like i know people well i think all publicity is good publicity but yeah the mental effects that this will have on him and people that view him from afar because it s like oh the guy that s like did this that beefed like this i feel like over time i ve learned that like as tempting as it might be or as fun as it might sound to like get your validation it s it s never worth it in the long run because you re the one that has to deal with the mental implications which we re seeing with p if reports are true yeah i let s just jump to pete because i do believe that the results of this and as silly as it sounds are literally traumatizing so him and kim broke up and this article says i mean i know we we re a little behind but uh in more recent times after kanye had come out and said what skeet his is dead dead at yeah so she came out or rep came out and said that he s been in trauma therapy since april and the i that s what i thought was a good tie to what we were just talking about because i think the implications of feuding with somebody on a large public scale are very damaging and while i think in the time when pete was laying in bed with kim poking kanye and it was funny and brave in a sense that like he was protecting the woman he was now with i think over time the mental toll that that has probably taken on him was exhausting now where it gets toxic is further in the article it says that he has no regrets about the nine month relationship with kim and i m sure some of that has to do with the time that was well spent with kim but i think a lot of it also has to do with the endless amount of movies that are uh coming at him his phone not stopping ringing because of the attention he got during this his career is at an all time high but mentally he s probably at an all time low and it s like this mind A A of hollywood which is like if you re because he s in the ether when you re dating kim kardashian when you re in the headlines every day people that are writing movies subconsciously are like quantified your worth as an actor is quantifiable and that s what i mean is like you re positively reinforced for negative behavior on the internet but is it worth it over time and i think that s like the big question and i think like for me personally oh go ahead oh no you go i was just saying for me personally and like i m not at a level of these celebrities in any regard but i ve honestly i ve obviously had a taste of like um biting my tongue or lashing out without thinking about it like obviously not thinking about it before i speak and i just think like being a little less popular and still maintaining and having like a good quality of life and having like a real life outside of what the world sees to me is like a better choice than like constantly being in a state of like anxiety stomach turning like constantly being the center of the converse the negative conversation to maintain popularity yeah but i mean yeah no i totally agree with you and i also think like this is something that i touch upon in my vlog this week but it s just like the understanding that so for people like you and i and i believe like a lot of people can identify with this like we re hella goal oriented right like you and i have always been like no days off i have a dream and you know as austin says make your dreams into things and you and i i would argue every step is in pursuit of that dream and and then i would say my mind shifted after it s shifted a couple of years yeah i m still very goal oriented i still have a place i want to go i don t think my trajectory to getting there is the way that i had once envisioned yes and you know like same with me but i think my shift has come more recently and like i really realized it while watching elvis the movie elvis finally saw it and you know elvis was essentially a prisoner of his manager he worked days in a row he hit the stage days in a row died at with something like four months worth of feces in his bowels that he couldn t get out on the toilet and arguably elvis was living what a lot of our dreams were but he didn t technically ever get to live he only got to perform he was like a a human in a zoo on display and at what cost you know literally the cost of his entire life the cost of his entire job today right right and it s like you know i the the it s it s devastating it s devastating yeah so when you put into perspective that life is not about uh uh material objects and when you look at people who have money and who have quote unquote what you want and don t have you don t realize the cost of what those items are and it s i personally think at the cost of your joy and sanity and i think that you know at the risk of sounding like buddhist or something as a very materialistic woman myself it s like i uh finding the joy in what you have is not just like a discipline to be you know quote unquote a better person it s not about being a better person it s about having a better life experience and when you re wanting less and enjoying what you have more you re in the moment you re not devastated by expectations and by the way your experience in this life is better yeah the destination for all of us is death so who gives a A A what you ve acquired that puts you to your deathbed i don t know maybe i need to come up with a new through line for my vlog now because i basically just said it but Laughter well your vlog s going up tomorrow this is going up after so it s fine oh great so now you ve repeated yourself but i even think like and i m not done like in my aspirations to work or have a career in hollywood or on youtube but i do think having moved to colorado after a lot of uh events that had transpired in our lives i think this uh has taught me a lot of that you know like just i feel like when you re especially when you re in la and you re like on this never ending circle that it seems like everyone next to you is also on it gets hard to remember that that s not that doesn t have to be your reality you know what i mean yeah so and you know to the same degree it s like you can enjoy what you re doing like i can enjoy podcasting with you i can enjoy uh my cooking vlog i can take the pressure out of it and make it more about like enjoying the experience and the moment and the blessing that i get to you know do that for a living which is A A weird and wild and wonderful and i can open my laptop and write a christmas movie i can open my laptop and write a tv show that s been burning in my mind or a movie that i want to see like all of that i can do and the value of it is not in dispute based off of the dollar sign i get for it ever yeah yeah also our christmas movie is so funny i do think it s important while in pursuit of your dreams though to be where you are for a long time like i had i would say in the height of my youtube i mean and if you re saying height of like in terms of like views or money or whatever it was like i was always thinking well how am i going to get off the platform or how am i going to get to the next point of my journey where it s like if i could sit back and be like oh my gosh what s meant for you will come and like yes i still want to plant seeds in the direction i want to go but it s like i don t need to be the grass is always greener on the other side i can be standing right where i m at and watering the grass underneath me yes daddy um do you want to get into taylor swift or demi lovato i mean taylor swift is hella fast taylor swift s uh short film the all too well one wait A A i m ruining this this is your story i m sorry it s so hot in here that i m literally i ve folded my shirt up into my bra and i m just sweating okay A A chair we don t have to go much longer because i think i don t i think it s cool okay okay go for it taylor swift s all too well short film is eligible for an oscar nomination which i think is A A epic and sick and then also super A A annoying for the other short films that are contenders because it s like going up against goliath like taylor s got like the marketing firm that she needs to win and it s like why even try guys go home it s not your year um and the money although i will say she does deserve to win something because like in her documentary that s on netflix remember for the last album that she had i don t even believe she was nominated and didn t or was she nominated and didn t win because it was corona it was one of the two for granted was it yeah i mean i don t know i m talking about an oscar and they re talking about i know i m saying that she deserves to win something because love her or hater i will say the creative inside of her is unmatched in a song writing singing thought out performing way like you go to a show of taylor swift s and it s like even if you don t love the girl it s hard not to be impressed by what she has created for herself yeah i love taylor swift oh me too but i m saying i m just saying i don t know that all too well deserves an oscar for short film i mean i don t know what s uh what s up against it i don t either but i d love to anyway and okay then there was also oh my gosh what what no you well if you have are you talking about taylor swift still i was gon na pivot to something that we missed oh i was gon na talk about dummy but you go go for demi no you go you said you had no michael fox well you put julia fox on the docket because we re on like the third out there i know she s worn a lot of things that have gotten a lot of attention but i m taking away the ones that were like produced by kanye we re talking about the solo going to the grocery store or going out yes to get internet attention and uh i just i ll say this is my favorite of the mix match of them all because it reminds me of angelina jolie and mr mrs smith and one of the angles it s very like body con like i m gon na go be a spy i don t know so i i didn t hate this one and it got me thinking that remember how i used to do those videos before like i wore jeffree star s clothes for a week or i wore tana mojo s clothes for a week i was thinking i should hire a fashion designer to make these outfits and i should go wear julia s outfits in public in colorado for a week because oh just imagine you ll be arrested for indecent exposure like honest to god that s not hate crime not being arrested i m saying or in parallel to being arrested oh you d be the victim of a door i hate crime yes being a victim of a hate crime so i looked a little more into this and i was like is this her thing is this like exclusively what she s doing but she does have a spotify original podcast we knew that but she s also working on a movie with bella thorne and i thought wow if there was ever to be a match of two women to collaborate and make a movie come to life i do feel like they have met their match together wait what are the details are they making christmas are they coming from i don t think that no there so there aren t many details on the movie um but it says what s it called the trainer and over the course of eight days sleep deprived chaos as it follows fitness expert jack down a deranged road of for the american dream and that s the only synopsis that has come out of it can i just be the first to say i don t have high expectations for these ladies so if what comes out of this is a coherent story from beginning to end my hat will be off well and i hope it goes straight to a streamer selfishly you know it watch it right behind me some things are like hard to find but i will post up right here and watch it us i um not recall the last bella thorne film to show in theaters well i feel like she s doing good for herself let s not knock no she s fine she s fine but i m just saying okay um i feel like we ve gone for quite a while we ll hit on a couple more hot topics we have a lot of good advice submissions but i feel like we re gon na have to save those for next week yeah which is fine so cause we ll be older and wiser next week oh so much so much better next week than we are today we will have lived learned and evolved since today and i ll be fresh off the vegas trip so you know i m gon na be informed i think we should hit on uh demi and then ann hish okay so demi lovato has recently been crowned one of the most obnoxious performers in all of the land am i right i mean there was now in what regard i mean people kind of lost their patience with demi when she came for the ice cream shop and then she did a series of events and i m not saying she shouldn t have come out as event they but it was confusing right as we were getting used to it like even on a podcast calling demi not by the she her pronouns she switches she does a switcheroo and people change people evolve just like we said we ll be different next week demi s different today and i ll let her grow um i do think it is like it s hard to grapple with but i ll get past that and we ll just talk about the music that she s putting out because i will say i vibed with like one of the two singles she put out and i thought wow maybe demi s like trying to make a reach around and get us all back on her side yeah i mean like i definitely get chills watching because uh she recently started the actual tour and there was some like and the tour was their whole album oh i don t know that much um but she is on tour right now and there was like um the virality of the tour was that nobody was buying tickets she couldn t sell seats to save her life and uh so you know people were like A A talking her for that and like people people really enjoy getting down on demi because of how obnoxious some of her her public encounters have been recently but she dropped some lyrics from one of her new songs uh about her time with wilmer valderrama probably saying that wrong but who A A cares about that guy where s she i just watched his house makeover on hollywood house lift and i thought it was stunning you need to why are you hating on him because he s a groomer who s been preying on underage girls in the industry for a very long time he s a repeat offender of dating girls who are to years old and then going public with them when they re don t come at me with that because i didn t know so don t try hitting me with something but i also if i were i don t know these facts don t go for the swerve right now but i m just told you i know nothing no no no i saw him on a tv show and i liked his room makeover and he was on that s show don t come at me being like yeah i don t A A know these allegations against him right i that s something i hate well hold on i m not mad at you but i am mad about like if i follow somebody on social media and don t know everything they ve ever done i m not guilty by association like no you got ta cut this kind of A A out like i really it bothers me because like i also i don t know any of these claims i m not standing up for him but yeah i don t know he didn t design his room we love the room designer i love that um anyways i m not cutting it out because i don t think that i did something wrong no that s fine but the reason i brought it up is because of the song she was when they started dating and being sexually active and he was years old so now that she s years old she s written this song finally and she s like for the first time sort of extrapolating on that experience because for the longest time like i don t know if you remember this but like she like in all those documentaries that youtube red did on her it s like she s always talking about how she couldn t get the A A over a woman rama how that heartbreak A A her and threw her into a tailspin for eternity and it s like no A A no A A it did that to be years old and to be mind A A and warped by a guy who s almost who s A A that s crazy and has his reps come out and said anything or has he responded to him i don t know that his reps have come out and said anything about it but i do think that this is a really important thing to have happen because i do believe that in society there is this uh disposable value put on young women you are of value to a man while you are young it is cool for a young woman to be with an older man it s sexy for a young woman to be with an older man but the second you reach a certain age that man is gon na be done with you and he s gon na go date the next girl that was your age when he met you and which is so sick and twisted because you would want i mean it s not a healthy state of mind to begin with because you would want you don t want to you want to be an equal in a relationship you want to challenge each other you want to grow together you don t want to be if you re in a state of like i m manipulating you in our relationship and i get off to that there s the problem with the person the older person exactly and you know not i m not saying not every uh i am not saying everyone is guilty of this you know what i mean like there s a big age gap between joe and i and uh you know like there are but we didn t meet when i was we met when i was and there s a difference if you re going after a young woman whose brain is not fully formed who s a A A high school student as a or as a to year old that s A A weird first of all that s an insane thing for you to want to do the age difference alone is so much that you don t even know this you don t even have the same generational life experiences to pull from to relate to each other let alone the same problems you re like it s just it s wild and that s what i mean and then her brain forms in this world of objectification where her worth is is tied to this man who s quote unquote valuing her based off of nothing essentially and her whole system yeah and then he leaves and so that s why i do have well the the thing that i love about this song is that she you know she she s very she s brutally honest about what happened and then she explicitly says um she thought it was like a teenage dream but then she realizes it s not her dream it was his dream it was his fantasy she was manipulated into serving a purpose for him that A A her up royally and then she has this great like i m literally getting chills talking about it right now she says you know i m finally i m finally would never cross my mind because that s yeah like honestly like it s wild yeah as a year old i couldn t i don t even want to hang out with someone that age yeah no no yeah i completely agree and i think demi has always been a great performer she s always had an amazing voice and this is what s hard about celebrity or commentating on celebrity it is so uh you you never know the details even like the beginning of this story i m like yeah i i know demi and wilmer dated but it s like it s not at the for like i don t know all the details i wasn t like consuming pop culture insane no this is what i but this is what i m saying though is so like us even in the past year are probably guilty of making fun of demi but it s like had i gone through all the experiences demi had gone through i d probably realistically be in the same position she s in maybe she like you know what i mean like a lot of the steps she has taken are due to different trauma triggers in her life and she like how she reacts to things so it s easy to make fun of somebody at face value for something they re doing in this moment but you don t know their whole life that led them to get there and that s what s like toxic about commentating on celebrity culture yes i agree with you and i think that s like because you re a better person than me i think you re able to come to an altruistic conclusion like that i still think a lot of the A A she does is violently annoying well that can be true a lot like you can be annoying and incredibly talented and incredibly insightful sometimes and then other times not so much like for me like i m i annoying but you think a lot of annoying attributes or uh personality traits that were developed were because of ex like if you look at like some if you take like some of your most harsh personality traits things that you constantly do that you re like i shouldn t do that those were probably developed by some of the things that had gone wrong in your life and how you react to cover those up right right and that s why it s very important for me to go to a meeting every morning so that someone could be like hey lizzy that annoying attribute that you ve developed like a callous to survive let s shave that A A off you know what i m saying like when you re aware of the fact that you have these A A more than micro elements to your personality that are like super obnoxious and you don t don t get me wrong it s never an excuse to treat people like A A to be a or horrible person like that s not what i m saying yeah i m saying strictly on like being nasty about people that i don t even know yeah yes you sound like a saint and i who is an annoying person am also saying how dare anyone else be annoying okay all right um well we do also well what was what did you want to say about anne well end the show i m sorry it s on a sad note i mean awful horrible tragic they have taken her off life support and she has now officially died i think they were waiting for a while because she was an organ donor to try to find somebody to give her organs that were of of use to other people yeah i mean i kind of uh packaged my sentiment about anne in with uh with what we said about elvis and like living your life it s like you know ann was at the top of her A A game and was tragically never happy to a degree in which you know she felt the need to go elsewhere to find something to cure her heartache and i think that is just a big lesson for me specifically as a person who struggles with heartache and wanting to you know put band aids or patch something that needs to be actually healed and i think that you know it s beautiful that her her organs which she was always according to the media so uh invested in you know donating i think that s a beautiful contribution to the world that she s left and i hope that she s you know resting easy finally and if you re struggling with something please seek help because there s there s always a better tomorrow there really is yeah and yeah i just my heart goes out to her family and her children and it s devastating all around because the truth of the matter is you can live life and enjoy it and have a good ass time and it s at you know the cost of using you know so all right well i know it s a sad note to end the show but i hope you did enjoy it i feel like we got deep today it s the post vegas of me you were feeling dirty you had to cleanse honestly i feel so dirty no honestly i think this is a great episode so i hope you guys enjoyed it we do have plans to be together again next week so follow us all on social media watch lizzie s vlogs every tuesday morning uh my vlog channel is also there as well and we love you so much we ll see you next

Thursday laughs you re crazy yeah we went to lunch and everything and you didn t even have a card no I put it with my phone remember that kind of thing yeah that s nuts it is isn t it I m very disappointed so we went hiking on Wednesday was it no Thursday yeah we went hiking on Thursday this A A takes me to do the stairs they re famous like the Calabasas stairs you see all these I don t care if they re famous I have not been able to walk since that it was literally a mild workout it was not I literally have been bedridden for three days and I go to the gym every day my calves hurt to the touch Joe tried to rub the knots out and the A A cops were called by my neighbors because they thought he was killing me I am in agony I ve done I ve been soaking in A A salt water baths and laying in bed and because I m old it s traveled up my spine and I now have a stiff neck org s theory is very intense and you do that so often that s what I m saying it wasn t nothing these stairs weren t nothing and then this A A A A creeps over off the trail up and it s like at the back of this gated community where apparently Britney Spears lives and this A A well she there s house drama with her too oh I don t care he s just like her new mansion so she s moving back to her old mansion I m glad that you know that of course all the gossip that I know is from like real house related yeah but so this A A goes up to the the gate that s around this community don t be crazy and then he starts saying he s gon na crawl over the gate climb over the gate and I was like no we re not doing it I think we have a footage of me trying to trespass and I would have gone all the way there had you not been like yeah not do that with you I remember welcome gated community in Calabasas because I m doing this homo out of your A A neighborhood listen it s not like I m gon na go take pictures it s not like I m gon na walk up to anyone s door I was gon na do hey I was gon na do a simple hot girl walk and appreciate the real estate Chris he I go I m not climbing over any A A fence he goes you don t have to I m gon na open the game from the other side and then starts reaching over and trying to open the gate but it won t open because it s a gate of the community so it needs a fob on both ends it s not like I did something super crazy because I didn t do it there s an entrance at the top of the stairs where it s packed I was very diligent I walked around the mountain sneaky spot where the other people who probably live or couldn t see him so if any interested on actually having fun with me I am auditioning new friends because you might end up in jail though guys so watch the A A out and his dog will steal your wallet but the fun part is hopefully we can be together uh I have been trying to do a lot of the hikes in the Santa Monica Mountains which that range is like so many miles and there s so many over here so I was very glad you joined me Lizzy s been doing this thing where she can t hang out with me unless she decides last minute she can hang out with me and then she acts like she can t go to lunch with me although I know she wants to go to lunch with me and then ends up going to lunch with me and is like we can never hang out again well I m trying to budget my eating because the food I ve been eating is just A A crazy expense I know but I can only have so many sip expense meals before it starts weighing heavy on my content we were working listen this whole this whole conversation has been about us working right and then when I asked her to come work with me yesterday I said listen we need something to talk about on the podcast come join me at yoga sculpt because I m on like this hot girl Journey yeah I know people start their New Year s resolutions in early January no every Disney day to start a resolution my New Year s resolutions didn t hit until February and I m hell bent on like prioritizing being healthy again for some reason I mean you re saying being healthy but what you mean is getting a six pack yeah well there s a difference okay well I don t want to like trigger anyone because I know like this is a different word for something that is just a chiseled six pack it is triggering well no no but by doing that I I have I m trying to like really cut down on sugar I m trying to be very conscious of eating a lot of greens and vegetables throughout the day I m trying not to drink alcohol I am trying to do like from the inside out health because for the last year in Colorado it s like it feels very homey there then the holidays happen and I did get to a place where and it s not a problem but I just wasn t conscious about what I was putting in my body at all I was just like if I want it I eat it and sometimes that doesn t feel good and that s what I mean like I could eat a whole bag of A A hot Cheetos lemon and then I m shooting fire two hours later wondering what the A A happened and it s like you happened A A you happened to yourself so I looked down the other day and I was just like wow my lower belly is like it s like it s not what it once was and so I just thought wow you know what I m gon na do this for a little bit and feel good as well like I m still eating a lot of food I m just changing the type of food that I m eating to be a lot healthier like yesterday I got a salad after my yoga class and instead of eating the bread I said don t put the bread there because I know I can t not eat it you know so I m just I m trying my best and then I was like well what is my even inspire operation and you know which picture I found oh no this is like you re doing a lot of Ed things right now you ve got your thing well no it s about myself it s myself oh okay it s my I am my own I m competing against myself okay I m allowed to eat healthy and you want to definitely are what s your picture okay well the reason that I brought up my picture is because it was from a sketch with you oh so many years ago that s not healthy you re never gon na be a year old boy again you got ta just accept that I mean do what you got to do but I mean you don t whatever I m allowed to be healthy if I want to be healthy I on my salad Journey um I or I ve been ordering like the Kardashian salads yeah you know the health nut the big salads you do the salad shake and I noticed like if there s ever an upgrade for me it s this one for a dollar fifty they promoted that they will finally chop your salad right but do they and we know that s my biggest he s a salad chocolate like I get a salad and I spend five minutes chopping he wants to be baby birded I can t eat those full Leafs of lettuce you need someone else to chew it no thank you I for one dollars and fifty cents I was promised expensive by the way which is crazy it saves me five minutes and that s what I m saying it s a lot of money but I was like if this does what I want it to do worth it does it it showed up full A A blown lettuce Leafs like it s still on the A A core yeah like you had to rip it off the little nut at the end it was the biggest Fu in the world because I really went out there on a Ledge yeah it was Postmates so I wasn t like I couldn t be like this because Postmates is actually really good and doordash I don t actually remember which one it was but you can just sit like if an item was wrong you can just say this item was wrong and they ll just fully refund you and uh but I don t know how to be like this upgrade was wrong so I would have said the item was wrong no it wasn t wrong is somebody killing us I don t know did you hear that yeah it sounded like a T Rex was that oh is it the chair off our roof it must be the chair because those legs aren t locked out Chris is in a director s chair it s fine it s rickety crickety okay well I ve been talking for a long time what do you have for us oh nothing I want do you want to talk about what you had a big weekend do you want to talk about it I had questions earlier you said you were bringing it to the Pod circling back to the very full moon Chris was actually with us but we re about to film Shane s podcast and this is very serious I m like out of in energy right now and this is like not a ton of fun right um but Uno had a seizure she said like really aggressive really bad lasted like four minutes oh God and of course it s right as all the Vets are closing yeah can t take him to a vet because there are like no we re closed in five minutes yeah and so I have to rush him to an emergency hospital he s there getting his blood work and his X rays and he s there all night all of uh the Shane s podcast is their setup ready to go and it was just a nightmare I we still his blood work and his x rays came back perfectly clean which like and I just saw him he s the sweetest well and that sounds great but that s honestly not ideal I was hoping that he had maybe eaten something that was like poisonous to him and they could pump his stomach because now this means that it might be I mean lower end he could have epilepsy right but I and I don t think there s any need okay is it I just want to interact I interject I feel like no matter what we can Google all A A day and come up with what it could be but that causes a lot of stress and anxiety Shane started Googling and then was bawling for three hours I was like Shane we have we can t like jump to conclusions until we see a specialist and the problem is a lot of these Specialists don t work on weekends because they re like very specific doctors and so he was a an animal hospital that was great they didn t have a neurologist until Sunday who couldn t actually do the full blown exam for Uno so we actually have an appointment with a specialist doctor on Wednesday the day this podcast goes live but it s just strange because it was a very aggressive seizure but then even Urgent Care the doctor was like well it wasn t cluster seizures and all of his work has come back fine he was like if I would have had any inkling that it uh he needed to stay here and be observed until he could see the neurologist I would tell you to do so um so we ended up deciding to bring him back home and it s he s like again no signs of anything um and obviously the worst would be a brain tumor or something life threatening but he doesn t have the signs of like he isn t like he s not doing he s not acting strange he s not doing anything he s active and a lot and even the urgent care doctor said well did he pee or poop while this was happening I was like no he didn t I mean so it s just right now a huge mystery what do you mind if I ask how it started um it was after a lot of physical activity like he had just gone on a walk and then a lot of times after the walk uh we ll play fetch with uh the three dogs and I do remember one other time after he swam actually he had something similar but this was during the day and I had called the vet and she she was like nine out of ten times if they had just been swimming it s their body temperature and they re just uh but what I m as like what does it look like I mean he like he was convulating he kind of lost control of his back legs convulsing his eye to me he looked conscious uh there we got a video at the very end the vet seemed to think he wasn t conscious but to me it looked like Uno was looking at me like how can I make this stop right I guess I could have confused that with him not being conscious but I swear to you like my eye connection with him I knew he was just looking like Daddy like how do we make this stuff oh man that A A me up and so now I m thinking oh was that one incident in the past actually a seizure and now is this his second seizure um we I m kicking myself that like I didn t take him after that because he did like his after we warmed him up after the pool he kind of just completely stopped and showed no sign so I wasn t like alarmed and we had just got in Uno s blood work prior to that one not long before so I don t know we re gon na see a specialist on Wednesday I m hoping for the best send your thoughts and prayers for Uno he is the world s best dog yeah he s my favorite Dawson Adams no offense wow um and then Riley I m telling you this full moon took my A A wallet be crazy Riley found the one Escape through this fence right that sun was setting she s running through the A A Mountain are you joking I don t know where she is and I was just playing with her and she like it happened in like she needs to go to like Bad Girls Club like this A A is crazy well no she s a puppy I mean I do agree so like when I first got Riley trained uh it was very like potty training and behavioral and like basic commands Sit Stay all of these things um and she s really good with all of that the thing that she s struggling with now is her puppy energy and I have kind of stopped being as strict with the training because life gets busy we got another cat we moved back to California it s just been a lot so now that we re kind of settled here at the moment I really need to get back in and do more of like beat her ass because she is out of line she has a lot of energy do you know what she said to me this morning what she looked at me and she went A A you and I was like Riley Ann and then she hit me she got up on her hind legs and she bought me in the face she was like I was like what the what did I do to you it was crazy and she s like I got your wallet she s not as bad as lizard she gets excited when people come over to steal their wallet so she can get A A online for herself and I know like a lot of people are like well you have to tell like you have to set boundaries when people come over too and it s not that easy when four people are walking into the house to be like ignore this dog and you know like we re working on it I mean I m ignoring her my other two dogs are fabulous and Riley will be there as well let s hope oh it s not like your dogs are much better because my dogs are amazing out too they re but did you did we talk about the bath already I don t know they got bathrobes also why are you bathing your dogs at six a m uh there s not a better time than six a m well this is the only time I could wash them and bubs is really smart so he know like the last time I gave them a bath bath time turned into two days last week which is not okay for me like I don t have the type of Lifestyle where I can give one boy a bath and then the other boy a bath another day like these A A need to be washed at the same time you know what I m saying but bubs catches wise and he will hide for hours somewhere where I can t find him which is devastating and terrifying or he ll like hide underneath the coffee table in the living room and I can t pull his little body out and he won t come out for treats or anything or he ll hide under the ottoman he ll like and you can t see him there like it s horrifying the amount of times I ve run out to the middle of the street screaming baths with treats shaking them screaming and crying and he s under the ottoman yeah um he said my dog is running through the your dogs are running through the mountains but I uh so now it s just when you come when we re cuddling in the morning I just grab them and take them right to the bath and then I wash them and they got cute little rubber ducky bathrobes those are super cute they re really A A cute they re my little bath Bros I love them so much did I show you Chris no they have little rubber ducky bathrooms I ll show you we ll put an image up on the screen we ll put an image up on the screen because it s so cute don t find it now it s right here I don t want you to be there s no findings look at him oh they re so cute I don t I feel like pictures of dogs are kind of like the little bathroom a lot of people Chris he s looking back at me in this little robe what his brother s eating his breakfast in the bag okay we re done we re done we re done what kind of reaction do you expect like what do you want from Joe when I see this picture it makes me want to quit every A A plan I have for the rest of my life and just hang out with these little babies you think it should have the same effect on everyone who sees it if it doesn t I don t trust you you re sick you re a sick dangerous person if you don t think that that s something that you should cancel all your plans to go cuddle with also it s come to light that my friend Sarah doesn t like my dogs and I m A A over her she s dead to me how did this come about she basically told me well your dogs are very misbehaved as well they love fiercely and I love them for their love nobody puts Bobo if you want to talk about airpod etiquette why do you have my airpods because those are missing too you re so crazy do you have them oh I just got a surrogate update how s it going I don t know I just popped up should we check no I don t want to do that live on air what if it s bad why would it be bad well we re waiting on her health results and that is like the threshold of if we can start a process of moving forward are those them I don t know wow I m so excited I just saw her name but not the song I could throw up right now no I m not pregnant right now I m so excited okay so when we re at lunch the the server had their pods in okay listen did he steal my airpods you need to stop where are my airports did Riley take them you re reckless I am not you re reckless Mommy okay so yeah continue uh you re saying he s not our server yet he s the one who served us our food no this is a place where you order at the counter and then there s a food Runner who drops your food it s not like they re talking to you right he might say like do you need anything else so he s probably listening to a podcast because he s not an actual server and Lizzy was like that is crazy yeah that s really crazy yeah it is it s dismissive as A A to engage with other human beings while you re not listening well I m sure when he walks up to the table he hits pause I don t care you re wearing earphones take them out why you re at work to you around other human beings the bartender wasn t wearing airpods the guy who took our orders I wasn t wearing airplane the guy who brought us our food and is walking he s around other people I m a buser at a restaurant where I don t have interaction with the customers really why wouldn t I not be able to I mean if I was a restaurant owner I would probably be like cut it out yeah like if I m a customer it s like they deliver it it s dehumanizing it s it s weird well see just be A A present why can t we be A A present why can t people just be off your A A phone exactly you watch this at my dogs no you re gon na if I had pictures of my dog in my wallet I d be looking at those too she leaves her phone facing off and everything mad because I take a call from my vet no that is not what I m mad about when of course when you re waiting on a call I do not mind it s when you have your phone sitting up and every time you get a text you mentally check out for two and a half seconds and I m like I d like to take you back to our hike at Fryman Canyon where you were Auto texting the entire time and that s because something was going down I had Roofing drama interesting so looks like we re beefing my money s on me I wasn t done I said oh well when I m walking my dogs I have my airpods in too but if I m seeing anyone that I m about to approach I always hit pause on whatever I m listening to because like my biggest nightmare is someone like vocalizing to me or saying hi to me and me ignoring them because I didn t hear it so whenever I have anyone in my vicinity I hit pause which is also annoying because then if they don t say something I m like what a waste of time I just had to like yeah whatever and you were like I don t do that no but I m also realizing like I m not like ever around a lot of people I did have an encounter on Monday where I was uh listening to a podcast while walking to my improv show and someone started talking to me and I had to be like oh I m so sorry I m listening to like terrorist tapes right now and they were like what and I was like I have my earpods in and you re a stranger talking to me and it s scary see yours would be even worse because you have hair that covers your ears they would just think you re freaking rude but when you re wrong I don t know I also feel like don t talk to a woman at night when you re walking your dog s in your neighborhood you don t encounter your neighbors not really actually I don t think any of the dogs in my neighborhood are well behaved enough to be around each other because I ve noticed like I m scared but I m like I don t have to walk the other way they re already walking the other way there are a couple dogs that ll say hi like there s a really cute like gray brindle Frenchie Sheila who will stop and say hi to icky and they re cute together they are real cute they re annoying as A A because Frenchies are done as hell but uh they ll just go like this in circles with each other until they re totally Tangled and um yeah icky and bubs have another friend named Lucky so we ll stop and say hi to those two but everyone else goes the other way I can t imagine why oh yeah it seems like a big problem ever usually people look at bubs and they just like laugh and he spreads Joy okay I think we should get to the Hot Topics because I also did want to try to get to some of our advice questions oh okay this afternoon today s podcast is sponsored by hellofresh a company you can rely on to eat

my name what who wrote l i z i e I don t know obviously it wasn t me yeah I probably wrote that down but I do know how to spell your name yeah remember you always talk A A about Julia Fox and then you sent me as as soon as the episode went up last week a tick tock of her and you re like wait why do I love her you don t remember this you re A A kidding me yeah I went well there were a few things that went awry so she did her little house her little house tour that s what we were talking about we talked about that she s an interview of some girls show where she was talking about like I can not believe you don t keep going jog my memory I don t remember I ve been in physical Agony for A A hours why from the hike that s crazy Lizzy I lost brain cells I was pissed because we didn t do the stairs twice I if imagine if I had where would I be today the A A hospital that is wild to me I think somebody that doesn t even work out could do those stairs do I not seem like a little lame to you today like I m unwell bro my neck A A hurts okay if you don t remember the Julia well no there were there were a couple of things that had happened one was her house tour the other was we already talked about her house tour A A I m trying to get to the other morning you won t shut the A A up okay what do you mean let me look up the A A oh my gosh so the other one was I m trying to guess what it was the other thing was that there s this trend on Tick Tock right now where people talk about like their sex no partners with mascara that wasn t it she was on some fancy set of a talk show talking oh she was with that woman okay she was on an HBO talk show that s kind of controversial I can t remember what it s called she was on it a long time ago so this is old news but it was just trending on Tick Tock again for me where she s talking about how all men are psychopaths right oh it s on z i w e is there gon na be copyright music probably oh look he was looking at Morgan no that it s the for you more gets on you for you babe that A A is trendy as hell I hate when you click on a tick tock though like from a link now it s gone and the message you click on the A A link of The Tick Tock and it just takes you to your home page it s like I clicked for a A A reason it s a glitch it s a glitch and now I can t find it it was like so far up in the scrolling I know what it says she says all men are psychopaths and if you men get to have penises women should get to have guns at all time okay because both are weapons of mass destruction I was like do I love her now maybe see we got there took us five minutes and we plugged Morgan s Tick Tock that A A is literally viral yeah she did go viral she did go viral she did do that she did do that that s our girl that s our little virality oh my God are we naming our daughters virality no that seems toxic okay oh no what the A A how does that happen oh my gosh what is this magnets or witchcraft wow all right get serious for a second okay so we have a new TV show The Last of Us the last of us are you watching this Christopher no he s not he only watches we re watching The Last of Us I love it so do I did you watch last night no there was so much on last night well it was on last night I needed to watch I haven t seen the Pam and Tommy or not the pamitami the Pam dog Pam doc yeah and then the Grammys were on so I thought like maybe I should scroll through that snore snore snore snore snore so boring no there s no stuff that happened that was groundbreaking Beyonce became the biggest Grammy winner of all times or something like that and even for the internet that s not enough the first headline I saw was like how Beyonce won but it still feels like she lost she I didn t watch any of it I m like okay internet I m sure she s happy about it like Beyonce didn t write article we ll go back we ll get back anyway this is The Last of Us oh my God well that s what she got when you got him you know whatever move it on from my nails um so you didn t watch last night no I am feeling so reckless that I would like to spoil it for you don t I know I want all I want to do is say like well guess what happened what does it live up to the game Joel s dead stop it Joel died I m going to kill you and everyone else is gon na kill you too if that happens now I will come to your house with my penis that is a mess what a weapon of mass destruction well good thing I ve got a gun honey anyway I love it I think it s a HBO recently has been doing like a Twist on drama where they go from doing something that s like uh they pick like a gnarly set piece but it s like almost just a drama show and I really like that hybrid well I guess if you haven t seen the last of us yet it s uh it s a series it s a series it s a limited series based on a video game made by Craig Mason the guy who did Chernobyl I don t know what s happening there sorry I have a lot of anxiety today it s been a long time are you gon na tell us why this week no I because I haven t been going to the gym so I haven t been able to keep my emotions in check and I m like A A falling apart like I go to the gym to feel well and I haven t been able to go because you broke my calves anyway Craig Mason s doing a good job he s a good man well the premise is like is it mushrooms um yeah it s fungus so that and that s a mushroom but the it s based on a video game I know that yeah but I m just saying it s a post apocalyptic world where the world ended not from a pandemic but because mushrooms or a fungus evolved to inhabit the human body and create sort of a mushroom zombie right yeah and so now the remaining the last of us are running around trying to stay alive yeah they re just doing the best they can what s incredible about it is after they set up the storyline it feels like there s a mini like it s like a different series inside of every episode that seems connected and it s so beautifully done this last episode well the reason we re talking about the third episode oh the third episode yeah the third episode was devastating so devastating like are we gon na cry right now spoiler alerts ahead guys okay we ll get to your headline what was the headline oh is Nick Offerman allowed to play a gay role The Last of Us fans say Nick Offerman is allowed to play a gay role oh you wanted me to read the whole headline well I was just gon na have a discourse with you about it but I what s Wild is that the internet I guess has decided that like obviously there s been a large conversation about straight actors not being able to play gay roles and so I guess like I don t know where this came from but I guess the masses decided it s okay that Nick Offerman who s straight plays gay yeah they re real picky and choosy with who s allowed to do what in this industry but I say like um it s all acting I wonder if these people are okay with living people playing dead people or if that s an issue as well should we just haul some dead bodies up I just don t know why we can t let the best actor win you re not I don t understand either and here s what I will say I think this should be more on like the pressure to audition gay actors should be more on the production and the casting director I think if it s a gay role great see gay people see straight people and whoever s best for the role let them act their ass off yeah who cares yeah I just don t like yes I want more representation for groups that are underrepresented but I think that comes from auditioning them and if they re not best for the part yeah they re not best for the part and also it s the character give me the representation in the character write a character that provides representation and then play the A A out of that character yeah and this performance was beautiful yeah it was so moving like I like and I guess because it was executed well and people didn t know it was coming because it had this casting news come out before maybe the internet would have abrupted like erupted but because they got to consume it they re like wow this was moving yeah um so I think reacting before something actually happens or even reacting to a headline of something even with this Pam documentary which we ll get to in a second I ve seen a lot of the headlines about this so blown out of context yeah and then you watch it and it s not even close to what they re trying to exploit her as and so I mean obviously people like to construct things so that they can be angry and upset to Garner their own attention online which is nothing new no nothing new at all welcome to Twitter A A welcome to Twitter which is why I ve exited the chat although I was uh watching um like a movie review girl and she threw like a tweet up in her edit that she was talking about and I was like oh my God that person and got likes on Twitter and Shane goes oh no that s views I guess Twitter s doing views now I you know I don t even know how to log into Twitter I mean that s wild like what if that s like Instagram instead of seeing I don t see likes because I was one of the accounts that they took likes away from which I m fine with I actually live happily in that space they also didn t decide to give me those like bubbles in the like or the status updates in your messages oh I don t know what that is do you have those Chris on Twitter No on Instagram I guess people have status updates now and if you go to your messages you can see the people that like you mutually follow oh oh wait I do actually yes okay yeah I don t have Instagram just decided I mean would you even look at it I don t know I feel like honestly all I do on Instagram is talk to Stacy like that s it shout out Stacy uh shout out Stacy shout out my girl Ashley I talked to a girl Ashley there too she ll appreciate this oh I was saying that that would be like if Instagram instead of showing likes showed views like how many people scrolled through it and I just I was like that s interesting huh anyway The Last of Us great series I also what I really like about it is as a person who s written for television I feel like a lot of the times you re forced into this box of Storytelling on page nine this happens and on page that happens and I sometimes like to write things a little bit differently each story has a beginning middle and end but it s a non traditional way of packaging it in a flow yeah and a lot of the times that gets me really negative feedback and it drives me A A Bonkers because I try to explain that I m telling it s a character study story and nobody cares and I feel like Craig Mason has done this so successfully by breaking the mold of traditional storytelling on television because each episode does not play out the way that like the a standard Network would force you to structure your story Unwritten rules that like have to be followed about writing yeah and it s like no they re written like they re written like they you can t get away with not that s so crazy because yeah I mean I m not a writer but I m a video creator and no one video is ever executed the same each is unique to that storyline it yeah and that s you know it gets it gets a little bit tiresome there are ways to be very creative about it like I uh because we re on the topic of it one of my favorite non traditional traditional Pilots is the pilot for Atlanta and when you read that pilot you know he s hit every Mark of the page number where you re supposed to be for a dramedy and and he s infused it with originality and surrealism and what the A A isms in it as well which is just so A A fun and he s you know because he played the game the way you re supposed to play it and then he morphed it and found success doing it now he can do whatever he wants it s one of the most uh acclaimed shows on television right now so that s really cool and I love that Craig Mason s doing this all right let s move on to this Pam Anderson doc all right the Pam Anderson doc I did want to say the guy from White Lotus was the other gay character yes and I loved him in it and I didn t even realize until I Googled him afterwards oh really that s how crazy different he looked at least to me oh I saw it in his face okay yeah I also Joe was watching it and Joe doesn t read anything beforehand so he s just like what are these guys gay and I was like yeah dude kissing at the piano he s like are they gay no like literally Joe s like he s like looking at the way this guy s cooking and like living he s like wait is this guy gay you re like actually no he s like is it covert gay code that they know how to what wines to pair with rabbit like it was so funny to me I was like yes baby this is a gay storyline he s like oh it s also so cool that like this is the most I d say talked about popular show right now and having that whole episode be dedicated to this gay storyline that isn t in your face or over the top but just a story about love Yeah is something I am such a fan of oh me too and then also can I just say I A A love that these guys showered before A A because I am so sick of Yellowstone showing all this dirty nasty A A Prairie A A nobody s A A with the dick that dirty in the apocalypse do you know what I m saying these mother God bless you for riding in a shower before these two men started A A for real that is that on God that is some of the most authentic A A I ve seen today yeah sometimes even without an apocalypse I m telling Shane we have to brush our teeth first honestly it s not just on you it s on both of us yeah the other well I won t go there but there was a moment in time where I was like baby we can t I need to brush my teeth first and it s like but imagine like post apocalyptic dick I just wrote a line it doesn t matter anyway loved that that was for me that took the cake for the episode on to the Pam Anderson Doc and also Pam s a woman who bathes a lot and my boys babe anyways just did this

uh like created and curated and put this project together I was kind of like uh like that actually I think it was a marketing technique that they use but for me me that was like a reason it took me so long to get there right but I m glad I did get there because I thought it was put together really beautifully like I I really liked how this was was executed it was so sweet it was so sweet and I love how fiercely protective those boys are of their mom yeah and I love their relationship I love that little clip at the end I think it was maybe probably from cribs where they re both on their little toy motorcycles I just thought like my note about Pamela in general is to me it s incredible how Fearless she is yes because in society a lot of us me included consider everything before making big decisions like she just said yes she said yes to what came her way she loved hard she would fall in love and fall out of love and just because she fell out of love she was like I m not gon na stay in a marriage because I m not in love and I think for a lot of people a lot of things play into factor with like where you ve set Roots if you have children financially like what does a divorce mean and I feel like this woman just threw caution to the wind and was like I m gon na live for me in this moment and see where that takes me a true romantic even with like Playboy she was just like okay I ll do it and yeah like all of these beautiful connections that one thing led to another in her life I just thought wow this woman truly is fearless I don t know I don t I don t have an example of someone I and I guess it s like some could maybe say it s crazy some could say it s Fearless I don t know anyone that lives as freely as this documentary portrayed her yeah I um yeah I think that s a really beautiful thing to say I also really like that she didn t feel settled in what she was and what she was doing and I like that she had a bigger purpose specifically being animals because you know we A A love animals and the fact that she took something that she wasn t crazy about the sexualization all of those things and she turned it into a platform and an opportunity to do good for the for PETA and for other animal things that she was promoting at the time and I think that s just so beautiful yeah like that s so that is so selfless and so wonderful and so beautiful and I love that she did that and I really like that they shined a light on that because so often she is just sort of made to be this like poster on a dorm room wall and she s so much more than that she s so much more than a red bathing suit also bothered me though because she chose to do Playboy she chose to do the modeling so all of that is fine it does break my heart that the sex tape kind of took away from the validity of what she was doing but there s even a clip in there when and she s at the height of her success on Baywatch it s the most watched show on television and And the reporter was like well are you ever going do you think you ll ever become or be taken serious as an actor and I wanted to be like A A I am an actor I m on the most successful television show on yeah like you talk to me when you re you ve reached this status like I am a successful actor you A A A A yeah I just wanted to slap the A A out of that reporter oh God I love you and she just like kept her composure and she was like she always does she always does A A she is the show and the show is the most popular show on television what do you think she s doing that is an actress I don t care if you think it s like respectable acting she s like collecting the check yeah she s made the face she s doing the work it s like A A you also I loved watching her prepare for the Roxy heart role where she s talking to it s probably the director and they re doing some character work and the director says one thing she goes no I think it s this and she like extrapolates on it and it s just like A A yeah dude like I love that sometimes it s really hard and it s really scary to say to somebody like actually this is my experience or like this is my take on something especially for a show that s so established yeah and especially as a woman who s been asked when are you going to be take like when do you think you ll be taking yourself seriously and that to me is fearless and important and it s important for work and it s that s like a great thing to see in a role model even just showing a polite discourse between two individuals who are working together on something creative who are disagreeing right and I really loved seeing that yeah I also loved her watching her A A start dancing for the first time in her life hell yeah dude that A A goes good for her yeah yeah I yeah Mommy it s good for her I just I applaud her openness to take on life should you do it is it the yellow one Applause approved okay this sun was in the reboot of the Hills yeah her son was in the reboot of the hills what s going on with that it s over forever probably excuse me I m gon na rise from the dead in years with their kids oh I get what you re saying yeah in guest news did we get him did you reach out I haven t reached out yet but I ve been wanting Spencer proud he s been wanting Spencer Pratt I sent him tick tocks once a week saying if you don t get Spencer Prada this was after I had pitched him to you and then you start sending me his hummingbird videos yeah I have already been pitching you Spencer Pratt I was down with Spencer Pratt and then you were like I can t do anything did you reach out no I followed him he hit the follow back he did not follow me back well are you verified no we might have applied to be verified okay well I m just saying he might not have seen you fall whatever like the hurts because I don t know how I saw it either like I don t know yeah and so yeah I ll ask him he posted a hella funny Tick Tock the other day where he was like at Erawan and Alex Earl came in and he did a post with her where he s like y all know how I love Fame so when I saw the most famous A A on Tick Tock getting the Haley Bieber smoothie there one I had to stop and say hi I A A love him dude imagine being next to a man who can be that still with hummingbirds I m nervous I mean hopefully he ll say yes I hope he brings Heidi I love Heidi I am I honestly do feel like they got a really rough end of the stick on the Hills filming and I like that recently he s been like airing out the A A drama well a lot and a lot of that s come to light even with selling sunset with yeah uh uh Christine coming forward and then not getting asked back to the show it s like yeah these people are bad yeah um okay so this next story gave me so much anxiety I would be so mad if she did this to me so Porsha surprised Ellen with a vow renewal on her birthday and Kris Jenner was the one who did the renewal or oversaw and this is porch s birthday oh it was Porsha s birthday it wasn t even Ellen s birthday I mean that makes it a little better it s Porsha s birthday right it s Porsche s gift to herself I don t know you would never be in this position because you would never even have a birthday party this kind of social I just can t believe it like Ellen walks out there s like of her friends there and then pop up comes Kris Kardashian yeah and Portia s scream singing I didn t look at what the song she was singing is but in my mind it s a Mamma Mia song and I know it s not Mommy I know it s Abba but I m a A A loser and in my mind it s like and the wedding is tomorrow I know that s not the song the sentiment of this was very cute and Porsha did have what felt like an oscar winning monologue prepared for this I think she was like well if I m gon na do this I m gon na get all dressed up and look so beautiful in front of all our Hollywood bigwig friends who might want to hire me so that I could get a job yeah she s like I m gon na have something impactful to say yeah it was pretty impactful I was like taking notes for when Shane and I officially do it and I did like that under all that what could have been a lot of pressure Portia said Ellen I don t expect you to to say or respond with any sort of words because obviously portions are prepared for it I still would have been like I would have dropped dead honestly my probably would have had a Voldemort s Bagel syndrome moment and just went out like a goat scared goat well I ll get scared when I come around the corner and Joe s there he s not even trying to scare me I just wasn t expecting him like it doesn t take much but I also love surprises so you want to surprise me my first takeaway was obviously that the house was gorgeous of course I m not looking at anything except for the A A house and then in it Porsha makes a joke she s like this is our th house in years and I m like why can t they find one they like yeah they re all like to million dollar homes why haven t they come across one in that they like that s moving more than once a year yeah that s too much you re so good at math thank you and years thank you that s more than once a year I love to move and that s too much you love moving yeah you re a sick A A I think it s like uh it s like a rebirth it s fun I mean like you look at dogs every day I look at houses every day like real estate is exciting looking at houses is different than moving into one yeah but when I find one I like it it s got to be executed do you like moving yeah I love all of it you like moving yeah I think it s I think you like boxing A A up and moving it to a new place and on boxing it and resetting up redesigning re yeah I mean I think it s yeah if I was as rich as Ellen I would move once a year too wow that is you think she s doing any of the heavy lifting I just think you need therapy you know we got ta get to the bottom of what the A A it is about you that can t be settled what is that about that is wild you need to chill yourself Shane s worse than it and I wouldn t move every year I d say I d move every three years but makes me sick just saying I A A hate moving more than anything I A A this is a bold faced A A lie what Ari is brego now too is what you put on the document oh Ariana Grande is not pregnant I don t know it seems like a tick tock lie have you verified or did you see a tick tock of course you did Chris can you oh well Chris okay there s no I mean there is a way she s married yeah and like it would be in the trajectory like it s not it wouldn t be mind boggling but I feel like I also feel like did I fall for this Tick Tock already I feel like this news is this the second time I ve texted you this I feel like this news would have had made Airwaves yeah I think you re right to be honest I haven t seen it anywhere else um my takeaways from the Grammys it s not real is it it s not real it s Ari s not pregnant uh sorry guys my takeaways from the Grammys was been looking miserable Ben oh Ben Affleck looked miserable and he might he might not have been miserable he might have just been uncomfortable like can you imagine I don t know if he like the Grammys is a place where people get super dressed up in like really fun campy costumes and they like want to put on a show Ben Affleck is like your typical straight dude that probably more than being miserable just felt a little out of place and all like all eyes were on him and he s sitting next to Jennifer Lopez I mean he s like this is also putting on a show it does feel a little bit like every time he s out and about paraded around he s A A miserable I mean he probably doesn t want to be doing these Hollywood things he probably loves Jennifer Lopez and that is in her DNA right I feel like she s a Kim Kardashian who like was has a talent built for fame are you just dissing Kim Kardashian on our show I m saying she had like in a talent show what s Kim gon na do whatever the A A she wants she ll stand there well great I I mean take away what they do I think Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian are built for fame like they they enjoy being famous they like being famous they navigate it well and if you re married to that you just have to go along yeah so I don t think he was probably as miserable as he was uncomfortable yeah I ll agree with that maybe he was just physically uncomfortable yeah but I m A A miserable when I m uncomfortable um you didn t want to talk about Harry oh I was just saying like my notable looks I wanted to love Harry s because it was like a full blown I hate it I m saying it was like a full blown Swarovski Swarovski I can t say it those were all crystals uh yes Crystal Swarovski Crystals no one has to say it no one s ever said it in fact in the history of man no one s ever said that companies came out but I just didn t love the shape of it but I did like that I liked I liked elements of it I wish it would have fit him better I like it I like the Liberty he takes and the fun that he has with his uh wardrobe expression yeah sometimes it s really sexy and then sometimes it s really not it s always a statement though and I can appreciate that I m not sure what the A A he s saying but boy is he saying something uh Bebe rexha looked I don t know who that s incredible number that was just magnificent and the one I m worried about most is MGK like I saw him on the E news red carpet and something s not right well so rumor has it that Megan Fox is sucking his life force from him oh they re like calling her a succubus what do you mean just they re saying that she s sucking his life force from him who they God the world hates Megan Fox they re sorry no it s crazy I mean personally I think that MGK is why would we blame his bad mood on a woman if he can not If he if that s even if that s the truth then detach yourself from the situation yeah I still think he s the problem like if you re not happy in your relationship you re as responsible to get away from it and I just don t like that the internet does it kind of feels like a Pamela Anderson thing yeah where they just pile on the woman the woman all the time she s always saying for the men to be out of A A pocket all they want and it s her fault I think before her he was still a nightmare he probably not probably like I know he s been very vocal about his mental demons yeah so I don t think we should be blaming that on her and I know that wasn t you that was probably Tick Tock he was definitely Tick Tock um but I would also say that MGK you re sort of like drives me a little crazy because he is constantly expressing self awareness that there is a problem and then doesn t seem to fix it doesn t seem to fix it and it when he does try to fix it it feels like he s providing his own answers and that s really it s hard for me to find functionality and success in a person who s like I have a problem I m gon na come up with a solution to it because it s like well obviously your thinking doesn t well I think from what he was saying on the red carpet last night was he measures his life worth in his accomplishments and he didn t win the Grammy or something and so he was like on the edge of crying and he s like it was a really humbling ride here to know that like whatever and then he s talking about his accomplishments this far saying that like his legacy of the man with the pink guitar won t go away so he needs to find happiness within himself and I was like I think you need to go get it yeah go exactly you need to talk to somebody that s not MGK MGK needs advice from somebody who s not himself like and that s my whole like because that s that s the way that for me that s how my mind works if sick Lizzy tries to solve sick Lizzie s problems you must believe there s going to be a bigger A A problem so I can t solve my own problem I have to ask somebody who has the kind of emotional sobriety that I want how they got it and then I have to do that right like that s what I have to do so I feel like if you re suffering from something you don t you shouldn t just be looking in the mirror and talking to yourself you should be talking to somebody else yeah that s just how I feel about it amen sister yeah because I ve seen him do this a few times and people are very accommodating and kind and everything but to some degree I m like is he an emotional vampire because he s making all of his problems America s issues and the thing is we just don t live inside of anyone s relationship you never know what s going on behind closed doors with anything and I think that he s a sweet man I watch him be incredibly sweet with children I watch him you know being a like really present for his kid and then I watched minutes of his A A documentary where he s smoking Blunts and driving miles an hour on the and I say lock his ass up because that is some selfish A A dangerous Behavior yeah you re just gon na kill yourself on the A A you re gon na kill a lot of other people don t be getting high and driving that fast listening to your album because you have mental A A demons what that makes ooh and that s where I lose empathy for this guy because it s such an immature self centered and he decided to record that yeah it s in his documentary I had to turn the documentary off because I was getting so A A irritated with it and then I got even more pissed off when I dived dove into some of the things that he said in his past which like I know that we are not our pasts and that we can learn grow and Thrive from it all but the A A that he said about Kendall Jenner back in the day is just like it s irksome because it s not a bit it s not a bit it s a guy who s literally saying something that s you know objectifying and grotesque and for a guy that has a daughter I m a little shocked that those were words that he chose to use I don t know what it is but I don t know if I want to unpack it it s not worth unpacking because it s like a decade old and like I said we are not our past but it s you know to some degree it all like the whole the total package of it for me is you re a sweet man for yourself find Healing yeah and it I m not saying it s easy like he s worked his ass off to get to where he s at no Fame is a difficult thing to navigate especially when you re like it adds a whole nother layer on but I guess I also don t think six uh you can t measure success as self worth I think your self worth comes from your character and the way that you treat the earth and the people around you so if anybody thinks that they re less than because they don t have a certain monetary value or a certain following on the Internet or a certain number of awards you re wrong it s how you treat the earth and the people around you period yeah A A all right I think we should do an advice submission before we run out of time so you can scroll through you don t want to talk about the fact that Taylor Swift talked to Harry Styles on the floor of the Grammys I want to talk about the fact that she dressed up showed up and seemingly won nothing well her record wasn t in consideration for this year it s next year oh so she just showed up to be a cheerleader I think so okay because I saw somewhere she had won like well I don t know I I couldn t I was like what did she win and they said best music video for all too well but I didn t see her give a speech or anything so I I didn t even watch it so I don t know the music video no the Grammys I like saw little Clips here I didn t watch I like scrawled but yeah okay let s get into some advice though um my husband and I have been uh have had an ongoing dilemma about the gym he says it s a make or break if I don t work out he wants our kids to grow up seeing us living a healthy lifestyle I agree but I can t understand why it s a make or break if I don t work out and just stick to my healthy diet and continue yoga apparently yoga is not working out and then it s one of these emojis um when I ask why it s a make or break it goes right back to him saying he wants our kids seeing us live healthy I think the reason why it hurts my feeling so much is because it s an ultimatum I don t have the same Drive about the gym that he does and sometimes he makes comments about what I should be doing when I m at the gym it pisses me off and now the gym is a touchy subject even when it s not about us my subconscious is making me think that he wants me to look like the girls with big booties on Instagram I m tiny I m five feet and I weigh pounds so it s even more touchy for me because it makes me feel like he doesn t like my body have you guys ever had an ultimatum in your opinion is this ultimate unfair P S he did not make this lifestyle Choice known prior to us getting married he said he figured it out as he got older oh and no he does not have a six pack and looks super ripped if you saw him on the street you d be like you wouldn t be able to tell he worked out he has a cute little gut LOL it s that emoji for me the pregnant man yeah if only dreams I mean I think it s pretty A A lame especially if this is like because right now I ve decided I m on a health kick it would be crazy for me to be like Shane you two now have to be on the exact same Health kick I m on and if not that reflects bad upon our parenting style and how our children are going to grow up and live a fulfilled life I think it s really crazy to put an ultimatum on anyone for anything because we can t control people yeah and you also like I mean I don t know I think it s probably unhealthy to start showing your kids things that are quote unquote healthy but that mommy resents you know what I mean like well I m gon na go to the gym because it s healthy it s not a great example of doing something that s healthy because it s good and fun and makes you feel well and if anything I think yoga is healthy for your mind and body yeah and is a well rounded full blown workout depending on how you re doing it yeah I hate to just call this guy an A A but the fact that this is an ultimatum is like sir you re kind of an A A yeah I just don t even know like I m stumped at how I would go about this if because I know people have drastic life changes at different moments that are triggered by different things but it s just you can t expect everyone to be on that same trajectory like I hate the Joe s vaping like I quit smoking and then everyone in the house quit smoking cigarettes but they re still vaping and how would you present that to him um I have said do you plan on quitting vaping and he said because I I m you know it doesn t matter what I want I don t think this is much different in regards to having children because this is I m sure you don t want your child growing up with your husband vaping just because it s I mean more than anything the puppy is attracted to the Vapes because they smell sweet and he will seek them out wherever the A A he can find them and eat them and that scares the hell out of me right and um they re everywhere because they re just it s big plastic trash the bottom line is I don t A A want it and I can not control what Joe does or doesn t do so my Approach is I asked do you plan on quitting this he goes yeah eventually and then his second response is and if you tell me to quit it s not gon na A A work and I m like I get it because you re a honey badger who I have to wear extra A A opposite whatever day gloves with if I want to get anything accomplished but no matter what it s like I know I can t make my husband do anything which is a A A annoying thing in and of itself but um but that s the point about everybody you can t make anybody yeah like my thing with Shane is the fake sugar that really bothers me and he s like he s aware too and he has cut back um because like he is now that we re getting further down the line of like getting closer to hopefully having a child he is being more health conscious in that way too but I ve asked him for years to stop but I I can t give him an ultimatum and say like I m Gon na Leave You if you don t stop the face you know ultimatums come with like heroin and sex addiction and alcoholism for me those are where ultimatums live if you re gon na be doing something that s life threatening those are where my ultimatums lie because I can t have my life compromised by the constant fear of finding your dead body or having to deal with the messes that come with those kinds of addictions and I love you and I want you to live a happy joyous life those are my bottom lines this bottom line is pretty A A stupid yeah I don t know this it feels like it s got to be something deeper I don t know why like you couldn t go out and go on a walk or a hike with your kids or go to yoga and especially if you re eating healthy I just don t know why he thinks that if you re not doing the same gym activities as him yeah that you re not being quote unquote healthy especially like everyone s bodies are so different yeah that it would be insane to think that you need to replicate what he s doing to be a good parent yeah I mean I would have a I would have a sit down talk with him and express in a very unemotional way what this ultimatum does to you emotionally yes because I m now and then asking what s what s your A A what s your point like what s the subtext here what are you actually tripping about because it s definitely not our future non existent and is this his subtle way of saying he wants her to work out I mean I would take the same takeaway as her which is like I m starting to think he just doesn t like my body and he s hinting he wants me to work it out I personally would never spend the time trying to figure out what he means I would ask him what he means before I start fantasizing about what the answer is because you can drive yourself A A crazy trying to make I m sure she already has especially when it comes to attract like uh feeling attracted to your partner I don t think that s some uh area where you can mess around with I don t think you can start saying like oh this part about you makes me feel less attracted to you like that s a relationship killer yeah and also like uh I would just talk to him and say when you talk like this it A A hurts my feelings and I don t think that s a healthy thing for our children to see mommy being diminished by Daddy and um what what is actually going on here what do you actually want me what do you actually want what are you actually saying because this is wild it is a very weak ultimatum to me and like quite frankly like dude sounds like a A A A A yeah I mean you definitely have to start with the conversation if he sticks hard in this ultimatum oh I would beat him to death like the longer I sit here the more actually mad I get and I m like getting a little Blinded By My Rage which I should probably work on with someone who doesn t have rage issues but because I don t because I don t take my own advice hi MGK um I m like blinded by rage for her I m sorry man that s a A A up thing for a dude to say he s really A A up and I hope that you can actually sit down have a conversation and have a breakthrough about this yeah and your worth is not determined by him no or your body size and I would hate for this one scenario to snowball into you constantly feeling less than in different Arenas of your life until you shrivel to filling that of nothing and he might be lashing out because he feels less than and that again has nothing to do with you his A A is not your A A do not A A carry his bags A A relationships are tricky because you do have to present your full self it s just so tricky like right it s very tricky to be in a relationship so I hope you find a way to navigate this well especially if there s kids involved I have a new piece of advice okay any piece of electronic device that he has to charge go to the charger in the wall and lightly unplug it so it looks like it s still plugged in a little oh we re not playing unhealthy he s gon na find that nothing in his life is charging and it s gon na drive him A A crazy and maybe you ll sleep a little better at night and that s why you come to the SIP to get great advice ladies and gentlemen I wish you well give us an update when you have one if you feel comfortable thank you guys for watching our show we so appreciate it hopefully we ll have Spencer Pratt on the show soon next week Spencer Pratt uh maybe two weeks hopefully uh thank you so much uh watch Lizzie s Vlogs oh do we do I should I should I plug it yes that s what I was doing oh I completely

environment and I m nothing if unfiltered is the pimple patch better than viewing the actual zit like what s the pimple patch is treating the pimple and I m not trying to put like more A A on it so if you re not trying to impress them who are you like who s the pimple patch for like I would feel like it s a treatment it s a treatment A A and I m not patching it up I m I m treating it I ve seen cute ones before it s like a thing right now where girls wear I was thinking about that but I don t know where to get the cute ones we should Amazon it okay hell yeah I would like that too I I don t know how do you know it s actually helping and not just drying the A A out of your skin and ruining it even worse um because I can see the A A that it s sucking out of it and do you try are you the kind of person that goes in hell no you don t you don t like no I like that I know but that s so bad for you like I m a I m a pale girl so I get broken capillaries hella easy and I ain t trying to A A like that and I m saying well but don t you like to know the juice is out because the zit keeps there s ways to get the juice out that s what the pimple patch is for I like to know it s out I wash my hands well I know it s out with the people two pieces of tissue paper so I m not touching the skin around it and I look in the mirror super close and I try to pinch and pray that a different pour doesn t pop because then you have like two problems and that s when it becomes a real issue yeah yeah sometimes I ll take like like super pointy tweezers to it also now that my hands up I feel like we also need to tell the podiums yuck we have disgusting Nails we re sick A A it s hard to be a new mom it is so hard to be a new mom I m not even like a mom mom I m a dog mom I know but Shane keeps saying Shane keeps saying like he s like I m a dog he keeps saying this is nothing you can ask parents out there the puppy having a puppy is nothing compared to no no we re not comparing we re not comparing comparing Shane and I kind of are because we re about to have a child so we re like right how much more difficult will our life be with the child versus the dog which I know a lot but I think the difference for me is when we have a child I will have prepared to stop working for quite a while like I m gon na have a maternity sorry I m sure we can still do the podcast I m sure we can find one day a week to do the podcast but I got ta go sign into LinkedIn and drop a resume out there I do prepare to take time off and have the child be my life until we have a new working schedule whereas with the dog I m at an all time busy place in my life doing Shane s podcast doing this podcast doing Vlogs and just trying to like maintain my life that adding another dog has been very challenging because they are little monsters yeah they re goblins in the best way like they re like Gremlins she melts oh if you don t know we got a new puppy and uh where have you been if you don t know posted the Vlog where you can go meet Riley yourself she s a beautiful golden retriever Lizzie s also a new mom our animals are about the same age they re literally the same age Riley s actually like two days older what s her birthday again four four seven wow so my baby was born before your baby my little icky nasty boy a little icky nasty boy My Little Riley monster girl I think her name is Riley Fenn and how like the thing is this has I guess I m just not chill like I m a helicopter Mom I m a helicopter mom also but I think I m like a chill helicopter mom well I feel like I guess it just doesn t disrupt your life in the way it disrupts my life I think uh it is my life so there s you can t disrupt what it is it is yeah and I want Riley to be too and she is but like I still have to find time to work but now it s just like I try to wear her out wear her out wear her out and when she crashes for that hour I m like got a power work yeah which is honestly teaching me some things you know yeah no I mean like uh I m lucky icky will take a nap on me while I write but if I m like shooting a vlog or something I just he s part of it he s eating my hair he s eating my face he s the new thing that s pretty A A up is initially he was just chewing my hair up the ends and now he s like no I got ta go in at the scalp and rip it out of her head and it s just like please don t man like please don t it s not what it hurts mommy really bad and he s going for nipples so is Riley you looked at me like a crazy A A when I told you earlier that icky was going for another I don t think I did you did you looked at me like something s wrong with your dog oh my God and you sit here now I am not the mom offender here that would be you or the mommy shamer okay well do you want to talk about what was being shamed that my dog was outside who is who has had every vaccination she can to her age and I just felt shamed by you um when did when oh that s not what I was shaming you oh she was in the grass and you were like she should be out in the garage yeah no I was worried about the grass there s an outbreak of something in La that is travels via like rat and squirrel piss so it s all over grass and it could be bad remember toasty or whatever yeah yes and so we did go in and get that one as well because I got really scared because we have a pond yeah and the deers go in the pond and pee and it s like I can t Uno s used to swimming like yeah Uno swims in our pool in California and so he sees that Lake and sometimes I can t even micromanage it he s just in there but we we have gotten the lake tested and it is safe for the dogs but I was still scared of leopardy yeah whatever I I can t even pronounce it but bubs is like a gardener so he s always out in the backyard like nibbling at his you know flowers keeping them tended and so we re worried about him did you get them up on that vaccine all right yeah bubs went in yesterday he had a checkup his teeth are looking good we scheduled a cleaning for October I love him you live at the vet dude I do but I got a new vet and my new vet kicks ass dude it is so fun going there there s always like Mad Dogs there Bub s got like super recognized and it s like every time we go to a like a new place someone s like is that Mr bubs you re like still as active I haven t seen him popping up no he s not active at all he s in retirement he s enjoying his retirement she s dealing with a puppy there s a lot going on yeah well I m it s a longer story but I it s not interesting and it s short but it s long I mean wait so bubs is actually did you announce his retirement no but he is retired no he s not retired we just don t really post unless we feel like posting okay um we didn t want to be like dog Instagram people it is it s a it s a commitment it s a weird A A commitment too yeah it s being a show Mom in a different way yeah and like I m nothing if not a show Mom but like I m I don t even post on my own Instagram yeah whatever um yeah so every time we go somewhere new someone s always like is that the Mr bubs or like when I took him to the dermatologist she was like so my vet techs are explaining to me that he s famous it s like yeah kinda but this is the first time I was like sitting out in the waiting room because he s better with the vet if I wait out because he s not trying to like impress me by being an A A um he s got that negative toxic masculinity thing going and so one of the vet techs comes out and just sits really close to me she goes so a lot of the a lot of the younger people back there keep saying that he s famous but I ve never heard of him that s yeah and I was like yes you have that s always like a little bit of a weird power play to me because it s like I think they re trying to not make you uncomfortable but it makes you more uncomfortable no I mean I m just like yeah he s famous I guess she s just a little more Shameless than me boys my boy yeah yeah I m proud of him in the house we re always like Bob calls the shots because he s got the most clout you re like what s it like having a puppy does it ruin your life it s like our lives have been ruined like we ve been living in this I know it s just like I applaud you because not once since you ve gotten your puppy have you been like flustered or acting like you re gon na throw your head through the window oh I mean last night when he was getting aggressive and ripping my hair out from the scalp I was like I because jelly put him in his place she like threw him on his back and was like No And he was like all right man and he like respected her kind of after that point but then he would like when he would like harass her he would just do it nicely like just like a paw on her butt so I was like I m gon na have to throw this A A on his back right now by his throat so I was like now and I put him on his back and I like nuzzled his throat but he s like we re playing I m gon na take him to a trainer I and that s what I did because I I know that I like the puppy stage is so much fun yeah sometimes I m like I got ta Tap Out Shane you got ta tap in yeah um and I know that I will miss these times so I m trying to cherish every moment everything because it s in here it s just like sometimes I feel my eyes and I know like no they re seeking death children and puppies are like what can kill me and how can I consume it quickly yes it s like it s like it s like what is is the world like so bad already like I don t remember my infancy but like I m sure I was searching for death and I can only imagine when a child starts to walk that it s this time a million but I think you can it s easier and I know that this is probably gon na get me some judgment it s easier to keep a baby in a cage Laughter than it is to keep a puppy well that s the thing I was just like specifically your puppy you got a very able Cape like a cable golden retrievers I think are known to be to chew everything and she is teething and in the teething stage nothing for her is off limit so I m just like where are we going this moment where are you going right now icky s eating the coffee table you gave us I mean and that s just to be expected yeah and that s what I have come to realize the joy that she brings us is worth all of the like exhaustion the destruction yeah is she does she have the Zoomies yet oh of course I love when Nikki gets the Zoomies I was concerned the other day though because he kept just like running face first into like the corners of the walls and I was like bro I d like check him for injuries afterwards I was like you re gon na split in two no body awareness for these things and these a tank he s just like ball buff like he just goes right through whatever it is but he s so small right now that he can fit underneath the Joe thought he lost him the other day he s like I was sleep I was dead asleep on the couch and jokes I lost the puppy and I was like he s running down the street he s falling to his knees screaming like icky had gotten under the ottoman bit open the zipper and was inside of it probably felt very safe in there yeah he loved it I knew it was in there because that s a hot spot for him Joe I couldn t find how big is the opening for the bottom well it s like you can unzip the entire bottom of it I know but how did they how did he even it s crazy it s like it s maybe that high but he s very he s a little boy he s a tiny boy he s a icky nasty me my little girl we have like open Kicks under our cabinets and she really likes well she throws her ball under it and then she tries to get under it and I m like girl you re gon na get stuck under there and so I m just doing everything I can and then the I know we re we ve been talking a lot about puppies and if you don t have puppies you re like I can t relate and this is probably get a puppy rescue a dog I have a problem with uh both you and Shane who can t you guys are animal hoarders like no we re not legit animal hoarders no we re not cut to Lizzy yesterday texting me do you think I should adopt this kitten and I I m like well not no but the problem well no I m like being A A by like the men in my house and not in a sexual way but like James will be like get this get a kitten like we need to get a kitten go get a kitten like let s go get a kitten and then sometimes he s like oh hamsters are great like I used to breed hamsters I love hamsters and then he s like there s a like at the LA SPCA or whatever like what is like the LA pound or something like they have a huge amount of hamsters that need homes and dogs that need homes and he s like let s get a hamster let s get a dog like all the time let s go save a cat like all that A A and I m like all right let s go because you can t tell me that an animal needs something and have me think oh well I m going to sit here and wait it out you know what I mean I know but the problem with you and chain like if I give the Shane the slightest go ahead on the puppy we have now I was like yeah I m okay with getting a puppy and he s like done it s like too late it s already here you know and I feel like you re the same way because you were at the vet yesterday and you re sending me pictures of dogs that you wanted yeah of cats you want to get and prior to us getting the dog we know somebody that had their cat had just had kittens yeah and so we were like well we want to meet them because previous prior to the puppy we were like we do want to get cheeto a friend because Cheeto needs an ally in the house yes him against all the dogs and he needs a friend when my sister s cat comes over he s never been happier and so we were meeting with the cats and they came over they were so fresh we had a meeting with the cats we did and when you say cats you mean kittens they re tiny kittens how many were there there were three you had a meeting with kittens she said one s already uh one s already like somebody s already dibs one and we re like okay and what s interesting is the one that was dibs didn t put on a show whatsoever oh they knew stayed in the in the little crate they were like I m too good for this A A I have a home I have a home A A off and the others came out and we had been wanting to name our new kitten Gucci yeah and so Gucci came out just ran to me which like is a way to my heart and then this this orange one has like little uh white paws like Cheeto and she was like boots because boots ran to him so now we want Gucci and Boots as well but I m like we ve got to stop hoarding animals we ve got to stop taking on more than we can I mean not I like to have for me my limit kind of is but you know what that s a lie I d have three dogs again in a heartbeat like I would be I would I would I would murder a stranger walking down the street with a dog and take it if I had to then it feels like I have to and that s not like a threat like don t call the police or anything but it s like it s not like I I I m not well that s the thing is we I you probably haven t seen my Vlog yet but the reason we got the golden retriever is because we were driving and we almost there was like a golden retriever someone for the Golden Retriever and I just kept saying oh it wouldn t be the worst thing if we couldn t find a Tom And I was like contemplating how I could get it wouldn t be the worst thing if we found a tum set it on fire with its owner inside it that s me rescuing a dog anyways I think we ve spent minutes on dogs so we need to move I could do a whole A A episode I love them they re so funny and you just don t care if they re pooping and A A all over your house no see I don t give a f I like to be strict up front I mean I have like I just can t control it she s a Frenchie he s dumb as rocks but the funny thing is is he like really really watches TV like bubs doesn t give a A A about TV bubs never watches TV he s like whatever I m gon na lick my own dick until it gets hard and then like jelly was really into comedies like jelly would watch Friends all day that s why she was so funny but the baby just sits there and he loves everything like the Bubby loves true crime or the baby loves True Crime any I was re watching so I I just got the color back on a short that I made two years ago but couldn t finally afford to do things on and I m watching it back with all and it s a scary short so there s like intense music and like weird monster sounds and the puppies like like so engaged with it that I m like should I test everything on this A A like is this the test audience I ve always needed like for sound design at least alone he s like trying to get in my hands to see it on my phone closer he s like what what I love him mine s a tablet baby as well like could not now I m judging if I m Vlogging with like if like when I was vlogging with her every time she sees herself she goes up and licks it when she runs into a mirror she s never loved something more she s a narcissist yeah and she does watch TV as well like she engages when something happens on the TV she s like yeah it s interesting I don t know were our puppies not just did we not have the TVs on when we had ours I mean I m trying I didn t have bubs as a puppy so I don t know what his deal is okay moving on sorry uh and I cut you off but whatever I mean I don t know I didn t have anything else to say okay delusions of delusions of Lizzy let s talk about what s been going on with you are they delicious you ve been walking through the world thinking everything is in your favor is that so wrong I would honestly like is it is that so wrong doesn t it seem like a nicer way to exist like the world s not against me but everything is happening well one of them is like I m pretty sure Jojo and I are friends this is crazy like I really feel like Jojo and I are gon na work together your unhealthy obsession with JoJo siwa is starting to concern me it s the way that you say unhealthy I know it s unhealthy why do you how do you know are you a doctor a week ago she texted me saying like Jojo and her girlfriend broke up I didn t reply because it s like what is that gon na what does that information do for me cut to a week later she says the same text JoJo and her girlfriend broke up and I said Lizzy you sent me this a week ago and I didn t reply to it so what s changed and she goes last week it wasn t confirmed and I said well you texted me as though it was confirmed still not confirmed it s just implied it s just implied which is unfortunate I d love to know what s going wrong there I know you know what it s not my place and I know nothing because I know neither Woman except I think it s Kylie s flowers you spend I think everyone like loves Kylie in public places on her face and you could say more it d probably tastes like straight up sugar but honestly I m gon na say some nasty A A right now I am not team Kylie anymore I think Kylie is playing with JoJo s heartstrings and I think JoJo s too much of a Powerhouse to be tied down right now so you used to ship the two and now you re anti kylie I think Kylie are they old enough for us to be talking about is there legal okay all right you should see what they re posting on Instagram like kissing and stuff so then they re not broken up no but this was pre breakup this was post first breakup pre second breakup wild what couples do on the internet right crazy Joe won t even let me put him in my Vlogs and I unders I mean that I wish he would because he s so funny it s he s funny and it s fun to add another element and inside of your Vlogs James I love when James appears oh James acted like he has bodily autonomy last night and it was A A insane what do you mean I so I was editing before I left or went to bed or whatever and in the Vlog James taste tests everything for me and so he said at the end of it he s like it s an eight and a half right now but like we ll see what the score is later because I feel like this soup only gets better with time so I was sitting there editing and I turned my camera on him and I was like okay is the scoop does the soup score exactly the same and he goes I know you re not A A recording me right now while I m laying here in my pajamas and I was like I know you don t think you have any rights to your body anymore I m a vlogger James except now you know how you know how he feels because yeah but I don t care anymore I know see once you have your own Vlog because now I m a monster everything for the Vlog my family are big fans of your Vlogs they re all watching oh really even Stacy last night was like I m loving Lizzie s Vlogs I made Stacy soup my mom talks about how much yeah Stacy Stacy my sister in law has a food blog oh she changed it to garlic lime and salt I was like garlic salt and lime garlic salt and lime it used to be Stacy lives um so check it out I ll leave a link in the description section below I just realized her it doesn t matter it s so boring it s such a boring Epiphany this is where I m at in life okay well what else are you having delusions about I should probably most things you told you were the one that pitched the segment no I just was like I was telling you I think JoJo s probably gon na work with me I m positive that I m gon na move my whole family to Colorado for the month of January to shoot our Christmas movie and so is there movement on that because I thought our Christmas movie was dead in the water because I yes our Christmas movie became uh dead in the water because I was very sad and understandable yeah and I was just like whatever I was having a hard time processing I was like maybe I should write something that I like that s like scary and horror and sad and dark and then I was like I can t do that excuse me sorry I m chugging Diet Coke I can t do that either so then um recently I started going on Hikes with my other writer friend Amy who I know from UCLA which I attended um did you graduate yeah wow thank you is that the downtown or is that in Westwood Westwood okay whoa USC s downtown okay trash I m just kidding they have beef I don t care anyways Amy and I were Amy and I are both writers we wanted to do something that s like accountability like we meet once a week and we go for a hike and we re like did you do the assignment and if we didn t do the assignment you A A loser loser and then it s that s really it that s the accountability but I decided we would work on the Christmas thing because not only do I have the Christmas movie producer interested and on the line waiting but uh you know I got notes from him on our pitch and I had a new direction to Pivot our story and then Shane was like why don t you guys make it about people who do a podcast and I was like oh that s so smart so like all these little pieces sort of creatively fell online and I you know re broke the beat sheet changed tweaked some things and I said I m not going to stop you from making me a star and also I just think how fun is January gon na be and I ve been watching recently so I know I ve been saying the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills but like Denise Richards was on for a few seasons she went off and did a Christmas movie and I watched the trailer of it and I thought you know what our Christmas movie s gon na be great like I don t know the script you re creatively in control I want to tell you about it at lunch today why can t you tell them because then why would they watch the movie movie for us to support us support I mean they the audience is probably the only reason why it would be like made well I hope so yeah but it s called canceled at Christmas okay and it s about two co hosts Riley and Lizzy who are codependently besties that s that s basically it fine okay well do you want to get into what was happening what s your beef with today oh my God the flight in what s not my A A beef with the flight in I wish you had been with me so it s like I don t oh my God no but it s like it was one of those days where it s like I need somebody that I can make eye contact with right now because the audacity of humanity is beyond my A A cognitive ability to grasp and um the just on a weird note nobody had any A A clothes on at the airport today like every woman I saw had on such short shorts that I could see cheek and like tube tops with no bras I m sorry it s not like I m pretty I m a little pretty but I m not like I don t give a A A what you wear on the street obviously you do no I think it s disgusting to sit on an airplane or a bus or like Bart or like public transit and have your skin touching you know what I mean think about it it s A A gross also planes are like cold and awkward what are you doing in a a A A tube top that s fabric with your titties and they re Landing in Denver no these were just all people yeah these were people going everywhere this is just at their Pro this morning it s just like don t you think that s weird I mean to each their own I m not A A uncomfortable pill pulling up your little fabricy I mean me yes but that s also why I take disinfectant wipes because I don t want to sit on a seat from somebody that s been there previously with their ass cheeks so squiggling and wiggling you know it gives you the ick it gives it gives me the you should have made a tick tock A A I should have but I don t like filming people without consent well oh yeah but I got the ick from like everybody at the Burbank Airport this morning so if you saw me there guaranteed I was disgusted by you I m sorry but then everyone s wearing a mask and panties well that s what I mean it s like you re wearing a mask but that s the only coverage you have the rest of your outfits just panties like what the A A are you what people are wearing masks in L A um at the airport yeah it s probably a good idea to wear a mask right now um yeah absolutely but uh then the other I just don t know the state of the world you know yeah now we re all worried about monkey pox and so what s going on with that I saw big it s big it s a big deal it s when I clicked on the article it was like it s mainly spreading in gay men who are having sex often promiscuously so I m like is this a disease no I mean I don t think people hate gay people I don t think so it s just the angle of the article that I read right I mean I don t see I don t see the correlation between monkey pox and gays they re saying that it s it s more heavily transmitted people that are having butt gay sex yeah I just I don t know I think I m probably spreading false news this is like a little thing where it s like I m spreading from what I ve garnered from my Tick Tock research oh God what I learned on tick talk about monkey pox is it s like pimples and fevers and you can get it from touching the sores all I know is it s a A A massive bummer and so it s not a cold it s more of like no it s a cold and it s and it s boiled and is it permanent or does it go away dude I don t I don t know somebody in light enough help us please you know what I was thinking did we just get canceled well no did we just get canceled at Christmas we don t know anything about it I m sorry this is not facts sorry we re dumb I probably have monkey pox okay now that is like teetering the line of whatever are you gon na shame me for being a victim of monkey pox no but I was gon na say what scared me also about the lepertosis thing that like your animals drinking other animals urine they said it can spread to humans yeah and it causes failure of organs I m such a f broken person that I m like bring it on she won t she doesn t want her don t no I would I couldn t stand it what did your dogs do without you wow wow I shuddered a thing I won t leave you boys now I m crying why would you do that okay do you know how hard it is for me to just stay not crying and then for you to say something like that now I m crying I think you need to have you been going to a therapist no is that too blunt of me to say no but I do I was having a funny conversation with my girlfriends on text today because I cried on the airplane the whole way here I know this is what but this is like every day you say that and I m starting to think like maybe my friends like not like I know that you re not okay but you ll be okay but yeah I m okay I think I think that they re for for me I think that there is room for both for a lot of things to be going on okay you know what I mean and like yes I am sad and and but it s like I can t change that you know so I m still living my life I m still enjoying things I m getting up and doing things I m being soft with myself and allowing myself to feel like I just I don t honestly I can t think of a solution for the pain I think you I can channel the pain probably and you know exist with it you know but there s no Advil I can take for my emotional yeah Agony and that s just I think a lot of people would probably self medicate to help a little and you don t no so I just cry in public I was texting my girlfriends and they were like Liz you live in L A guaranteed there s a A A French Bulldog grieving group you can join and they have meetings every hour on the hour and I was like honestly probably do they probably do because my friend Cynthia was like you should go to a grieving group and I was like do you think they d be offended when they found out it was about my dog which I don t even like saying because I feel like that s demeaning to jelly because she was more than that because she was both my mother and my daughter and my boss and my co worker and the funniest girl and the most so sweet like honestly so cute um well this is Gon na Roll you out it just did sorry today s webcast is supported by liquid IV the hot

I would like to formally and publicly apologize for the first time in my life I m just trying to make sure we re both in Focus so the issue well I ll let you go on with your apology first well I would like to apologize that God gifted me with some long limber toes I got up to go potty and my toes wrapped around this cord that cord and the tripod and ripped everything including your soda and the motherboard down onto the ground camera down SIM card out and of course it s on a day when Christmas my year is over because I already had a breakdown trying to set this all up because I m I don t like how the camera we typically it s such a long boring story I m using a different camera Heath has a panic attack every time we set up and today he was like what do you think it s like I think you need to just go through it and she s sitting here scrolling on Tick Tock I m like could you help a little and she s like I don t think that helps you I don t think I don t think I can I think the most helpful I can be as out of the way and not tearing the entire set down when I get up to go pee pee but you know A A do be happening yeah and Chris is in Germany which is why he s not upon us but hopefully upon us let s pick a different here with us is it was it wrong he s like not on us like there s already internet speculation that Chris is A A everybody in your family what does upon okay what s the definition like something like the Dawn was upon us like it s on yeah I think that s fine Chris is on us yeah normally he is on us he tells me I have beautiful blue eyes I like that you re not gon na give up on this one don t back down from it well sometimes I just want to know why you have to correct because you re A A wrong so somebody just can t be wrong around you no and I don t like I like being corrected when I m wrong because I d rather not look like a dumb A A out in these streets saying something wrong does Joe correct you yeah what s the last time he corrected you he s never right so no he corrected me on something about the our cutting board but and I had to go on my Vlog and block everything about a cutting board because they like your husband s right oh that you were using it upside down restricted comments are now a thing I agree no I m just kidding they re not no he s right he s right he s right he s right and I m comfortable and fine admitting that but as soon as this podcast off I m gon na call him and uh verbally abuse him for being right okay have you been following through on yoga because last time Lizzy was here it was after we had recorded podcasts so I had taken you to my workout class of choice because you had gotten me onto Orange Theory I thought you should dabble into yoga I am all about the hot yoga I do think that s why I have a huge pimple on my face though it does bring everything out I learned that if I don t shower right after and cleanse my face well yeah it will bring the dirt to the surface and cause a breakout and I ve never quite sweated like this so I think that I m like breaking out with years of rubbish lodged in these pores but isn t it like nothing else I really like it I feel better after I do it mentally and physically unless like the other day I was like wow I wonder if I like ate poison last night because I was sweating and so weak in the class that I like couldn t do every pose and it s like use I even in sculpt yoga I tried every pose and I was like oh I can not do all of these I will I am to faint but I also think I m dehydrated because I m not used to having to drink extra water because I m losing all my water and that is like it s hard to keep up with them I ll get headaches sometimes because I can t replenish the water that has left my body but it does just rejuvenate my soul even more than I would say the benefits to my body it just makes me feel renewed which is probably a reason I need it right now you know with all this puppy energy you do need a chill pill there might be a pill for you you think so yeah it s called a chill pill bro like an anxiety well but it s not anxiety so would it be like was Lexapro but I don t I don t think I m I think it might just be a deep breath and a gratitude practice you know the puppy has taken away my morning meditation because normally I m used to going straight out to my patio I make my cup of coffee I have my minute meditation but with the puppy the mornings are so chaotic no I don t have that in space anymore and not to do like another minutes on puppies but in like in regards to All Things life I m stressed out that there s an SD card there should it be in something no this is the case for when I put it in the computer okay so in regards to All Things life I think it is really easy to become anxious and stressed out about things and specifically people like you and I who are like we have so much to do like and it you know my news flash to me everyone has so much to do it doesn t matter that everybody is stressed out like just because everybody is stressed out doesn t mean you shouldn t be stressed out the point being is acceptance of the fact that you must face what is in your path regardless and I find when I accept what s in my path no matter what and I as it is what it is to be and no matter what I all I can do is is manage it and then manage it yeah I lose so much more of the stress like like the amount of times I hear Joe scream oh God damn it oh my God like the other day I was like trying to poop which I ve been struggling to do lately and he s screaming bloody murder in the kitchen so I m like all right I guess I ll get back up even though I was so close and run out there because it sounds like he s dying what a good wife he just spilled a smoothie that just clean the A A just clean up the clean of the smoothie and it s actually an old saying it s there s no use crying over spilled milk well even he also had his pants around his ankles he s like it s all over my underwear I was like oh my God you re ever gon na Vlog him that was the time I know it s so invasive but like what a great moment and icky was covered in green spinach smoothie and I was like well I ll get the puppy and I ll wash them off and it s like what else are we going to do right now Joe nothing are we gon na stop the world no the world s still gon na Spin and the dog s still gon na be covered in spinach it s like it s even he s the same way with like the piddle pads and like the trash like he will fill the trash up so that there s like this much space in it and then I will come in and just put the rest of I ll just fill the rest of that space But no matter what it s like I could take it out or he could have taken it out but no matter what he s always livid that I m not the one that took it out it s like then you can take it out he doesn t watch the show this is such a waste because I ll never say it to his face he scares the A A out of me oh my gosh I ll send him a clip I ll clip this don t I love you baby I do I love him he s my dream no we re fine I we just had you know everything s fine everything s fine everything s I do think you guys need to get new floors though that s A A psychotic that you can t get dampness on it in a place that has tornadoes at a A A lake house in the front like what kind of weird Choice was it for them to like make floors you can t Drool on no I used to have the dog s water bowl on these wood floors like it had a placemat under it but if you know how dogs walk away from water bowls and yeah and they drip more there s big water stains from the drips from their mouth of the water bowls now the water bowl has to be on the tile in the kitchen because our wood floors are so sensitive and I was like I don t know it s a family home yeah you know like who they ll never understand that it s like having a white couch and a toddler it s like what do we what kind of games are we playing what kind of sick A A A A is this yeah yeah whatever I ve made that mistake in my bedroom with the dog oh everything s white yeah like an edible the most no in the house in California like and the dogs just like the dirt from the day yeah if I don t like whatever doesn t matter got ta let it go my rug s disgusting get into some iced tea these are all from Elizabeth Gordon uh oh what I just can t remember any of them oh Nick Jonas and Priyanka have shared the first photo of their baby but they covered her face as they celebrate her six months of life and when you brought this up to me you said that they had a six month celebration like yeah I thought you meant it had lasted for six months their celebration oh no the baby is six months old and they re celebrating they re through a celebration and this is the story well I was judging it to be completely honest I was like that s A A crazy and then I remembered like oh be people celebrate every baby s first month of whatever oh it s like one month two month update three months four and a six month celebration I guess I haven t had a kid yet so I don t know what it s like I m sure it ll be like that yeah we ll probably be worse this is the baby s th hour and what did they do for the birthday celebration oh I don t know I just jumped straight to judgmental and then I was like look at yourself in the mirror A A and act like you don t do that A A with your dogs like name one person who s not more absurd about something and it s like oh it s probably you anyways in other news Lady Gaga s dog walker attacker there s got to be a cleaner way for me to say that the guy who shot Lady Gaga s dog walker wait he was shot where the A A have you been Lady Gaga s dog walker was shot four times in the chest and then stole the dog yeah two steal the dogs okay it seems like he could have done it without shooting but okay you didn t need to do it four times he didn t need to steal the dog this is a common thing though like people with French Bulldogs because you can sell them for so much money her dogs are French Bulldogs there s like articles all online of people stealing French Bulldogs the other day Joe left me alone on Ventura Boulevard and I was holding icky and I was like this is it this is how I die anyways he was accidentally released from jail and he is now out in the world how La is a A A up place right now dude Law and Order wise if you got some crimes to commit La is the place to do it baby you can do the crime and pay no time well yeah I guess they like even I guess well it might be old news but people were just stealing from grocery stores and they re allowed to yeah if it s under a thousand dollars the police aren t gon na come well that s why the Grove was getting you know hit up all the time because why wouldn t you they re just going in in broad daylight too like barely a face covering in sight and it s like Sephoras are getting looted Bloomingdale s are getting like everything s getting looted um people are being followed home and robbed it s crazy it s A A crazy anyways Ben Affleck oh my gosh Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are married and wow yeah that happened fast we couldn t we re like so enthusiastic about our topics of choice you put me on you know what you put me on this mic I do you gave me this platform you flew out here uh because sip daddy over here said Lizzy the world wants to hear your voice no I did I haven t even seen her dress or anything yet I have pictures it was low key it was low key they got married in Vegas they eloped uh yeah everything s posted wow yeah they did the damn thing and now they re in Paris honeymooning with their kids when I swiped to the left on my iPhone and saw like the photo accompanying the headline I just saw a picture of Ben Affleck looking disheveled and I was like they can t do that they got ta give him a break they got ta give that man a break he is going like he is tired enough like I m tired for the paparazzi for Ben it s just like let the man live I like I wonder if it s the paparazzi or if it s like a new version of resting A A face but it s resting Ben face where it s just like I have resting Ben face like all the time I m like damn I ll be like sitting at my computer writing and I m like why is your why are your lips turned down what yeah I straight up look at my computer like this all day what is that I feel it too in my in my muscles I m like yeah apparently it takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile so I don t know what you re out here doing what is that Ben there s a support group for girls like us let s talk about it I m even doing it right now like it s this is how I and I I feel the muscles activating and I ve even gone so far as to get BOTOX in my chin to try and knock this A A off but I m so strong that I can beat the paralytic paralytic whatever gravity gravity wow is that it are we gon na have to cut everything no why we re so low energy and so don t care about anything we re talking about I care I was relating to Ben Affleck s grumpy face um and Florence Pew and Harry Styles star in so the don t worry darling trailer dropped what s that that that s the movie where um what s wrong okay so Florence the the I m gon na call her by the right name because I actually read a comment that we lost somebody because of how disrespectful I was to Florence Pew hey why can t they hate you and still listen well the crazy thing was they re like they re just well they were mad because you didn t even know who she was oh please he doesn t know who anybody is yeah I m not even sure he knows who the sitting president is so chill your bull on that A A that was wild wait that comment you guys don t even know if Florence view is I m leaving see you later honestly honestly get gone we don t need it we could sit comfortably with no audience talking to a void we do that no matter what we do do that but you know I just when who is she again I know she showed her nipples for like Dior or something she s an actress okay yeah great it s because that doesn t you literally don t know who anybody doesn t degrade her Talent no it doesn t that s what I m saying she brightly she doesn t know who Ryland is yeah and I don t expect her to why would she why would she why would she why I bet she s fantastic but honestly I like listening to podcasts where I disagree with one of the hosts on one of their opinions because if we don t disagree if we agreed on everything how boring it d be weird so it d be weird you re welcome for like you re welcome I used to go on Tinder just to fight with strangers and we come here every week to fight with you is it toxicity if you want if you want to pick if you have a bone to pick with us get on Tinder no and talk to a A A stranger about it in a heated way that surprise FaceTime call was a real hit last week that was fun as A A so maybe we should start FaceTiming people surprise guests how do you surprise a person with a well after next week come back oh my God here s a cliffhanger for next week for a thing that I ve pitched Ryland that I m not sure we re gon na get follow through on but we might okay I got ta check in with these people we ll talk anyways ah the premiere of the trailer for don t worry darling Olivia Wilde s next cinematic feature where her and Harry fell in love where her and Harry fell in love unconfirmed confirmed unconfirmed there we don t know if they re together or not I don t think they ve ever confirmed it but she s always at his shows dancing and they re A A around they re definitely having sex I mean who s not having sex with Harry Styles I mean a lot of people I feel like I m having sex with Harry Styles like you re cooking with Jojo so honestly there s I do remember all the other ones it s like they re just like super embarrassing like I don t really want to say them on their own so wait no come on give it to me we need something I need something to lighten up the mood here I ve been so mad if Joe talked like this in public what do you mean say it but I feel bad saying it well now I have to know if it s that awful we ll cut it in post okay the confidence okay no because I would honestly my heart would break if I heard Joe talking like this okay well then maybe you shouldn t well that s my delusional grander like that s what I m saying like it s crazy A A it s crazy A A because you think Harry Styles sleep wants to sleep with you oh yeah I mean and it s not just him Harry Styles is like whatever I do know that I would be weird if I was in a room with him in a way that I would be so hurt if Joe was around another woman okay but in my mind I m so I m so I am in the same class as Harry Styles and that s the sickness that hurt my feelings that was crazy well I just don t think anyone s on Harry s level like I might be that s what s crazy in my mind I m on such a level that Harry Styles is literally compromising the Integrity of my marriage this will not be cut out these are the delusions I have and then the other one is sometimes I m like A A should I even be married because a guy like a joke and stranger things Steve from stranger things exists I think about Steve from stranger things and I m like I made a mistake honestly I m I think you should get a divorce now after saying that publicly really because it s crazy right yeah but Joe s literally my dream I know I would kill for him I would lie to the police and take the fall for something I did not do to keep him out of jail I would go on the Run burn my figure bring my fingertips and rip out my A A teeth so there s no Dental record for that man I don t know why I would ever need to do that but I would I love him very much and I think Harry Styles existing is a threat to my marriage okay so what s going on with the actual headline there s some weird beef going on between there so it s speculated that there s beef between Olivia Wilde and Florence pew in what regard is she in the movie as well Florence is the movie Florence is the lead Harry s her plays her husband in it and honestly the movie looks pretty sick like I m actually really excited to see the movie so Olivia s directing her alleged boyfriend with a different woman yes and I know you have a hard time fathoming like in our Christmas movie you re like I don t even want kissing between us because like we re married not in the first minutes there s a whole kissing Montage where you and I are literally kissing everything we can I mean fine Shane s gon na it s funny though it s funny he s fine Shane knows I m an actor I can t wait to tell you about the scene at lunch okay he knows I m an actor that s toxic fantasy you want to talk about delusions of a grander that s your delusion of Greater we re going to be so bad in this movie that we have to just pray that there s like at least Christmas movies everyone s bad in them like in my mind this is another delusion of grandeur we re making a blockbuster that ll be in theaters you know if some people that I don t know yes I yeah and I my delusion is that like I know I can t act but I m like somebody s gon na write me so then it s I m writing you perfect see I m manifesting this into my life so see am I manifesting Harry Styles ruining my relationship and so now that Florence s tits out somewhere what what if the plot set the plot twist of the century is JoJo siwa breaks up my marriage and I am gay the amount that you tease you being gay well it s just because it feels like there are some there are some gay synchronicities about me what s the life I m talking about do you watch gay porn not lesbian oh no I do watch lesbian porn exclusively I only watch lesbian porn but I think that s a straight girl thing um other things I tell myself to be heterosexual at night as long as you still get hard for Joe I only get hard for Joe okay well it doesn t seem like that when the last minutes of the show I know but sex is fine yeah experts would say sex was more than fine it was just the way you said fine that made me like well I was just making sure sex is sex with Joe is great this is like because I know his mom s watching even though I ve told her not to shut up Marge get out of here MOG I ve told you to mind your own business go back to the Vlog keep it streaming I feel like this is such a niche podcast it s like us my mom my mom nothing okay let s get into advice though all right hit up that shoot okay no I got ta feed this woman yeah I m struggling this is what happens I also had this weird thought in my head was like oh before I get on the plane I m gon na cut up a bunch of apples and bring some cheese slices and I ll also make some hard boiled eggs so I ll be like protein and nourished and I never do it and you sat there like it was like cement in my mouth and I ate what I could she literally took two bites and left it on the dining table and it s probably rock hard and honestly I was waiting for you to go to sleep so I could just throw the A A Bowl away in your neighbor s trash can I just don t like it s just because I don t think oatmeal tastes great but it s just something I forced down my body I think you could have a lot more joy in this life anyways that s for a different person you write into the system the second half of this episode s weird because our break was weird and then like we had like the puppy running around and I was like trying to work it s hard being a working mom it s hard being a working mom and I m not comparing it to being a real mom I know this episode is going to hit me hard with criticism that I m not ready to be a parent because I m being dramatic about my puppy and it s like I m being dramatic about the puppy because it s just where s the deal let s normalize being honest about our A A overwhelm that s that s something that everybody can relate to all y all A A are overwhelmed stop acting like you re A A not that s a weird way to comment something about me and my life thinking why don t you just cry instead why don t you just take a deep breath and be like I m A A over around and see I have no well I won t get into this why don t you start with some advice come here my baby Uno come lay down God help this poor woman single girls around her man oh this is on theme as in you know Harry being around me and JoJo being around me okay so long story short I m and married it s been hard since we re both so young and being in a big commitment at the same time trying to live a normal life my husband has been out with the boys a lot lately which is okay I don t mind where I get a little uncomfortable is when his boys bring a bunch of single women and my husband doesn t tell me so now he s acting different when I try to mention how I feel he tries to justify uh his boy s actions and dismiss the fact that he s not making me feel secure send help wow girl so she s in a long term committed relationship they re trying to live life as year olds yeah they re married yeah okay but his friends are all living the single life and bringing a bunch of single girls around while they re all hanging out and that makes her feel some type of way uh I super relate to this because all of Joe s friends are basically single so sometimes he ll be like I want to go out with the boys and it s like yeah go out with the boys but there is like this thing where you re married and it s like the assumption is I m coming right you know what I mean so it s very hard but we re in a different Dynamic like that s that s abnormal for our age group but for year olds the normal the norm is the boys go out yeah go out yeah and there are girls around and I think that you know it s a bigger I m never insecure the Joe s you know with JoJo siwa or Harry Styles cheating on me girls that are ready to have fun around what I don t like is the disrespect to my title as the wife because if the wife s not included but there are some frivolous oh so friends if the wife isn t invited but all the single women are invited that is A A up that upsets me greatly so you ll if you ever call and you can hear other girls but you re like but you didn t invite me to this event it is so then what do you do because this is the pretty it s this it s a similar predicament yeah so I take a deep breath and realize that I also spend a lot of time around men you do yeah I do I have a lot of guy friends and so and I have a lot of girlfriends too it s balance yeah but I think the hard part and this is me projecting you can tell me if I m wrong but it feels like when you go out it s like me and you are going for a hike and getting lunch which is like so see and that s it s like we re doing nothing right like it couldn t be more like but I m also about to go to Vegas on a bachelorette party and go to a strip club okay and he s cool with it so what s your advice is if you have legitimate trust issues that s different if you have an annoyance and a pit in your stomach that s it s like because I m annoyed is this is my annoyance because there s something scratching at the back of my head that says my husband s cheating on me or am I annoyed because it s annoying because it s annoying yeah especially if she s not invited yeah and then there s other women around if you re concerned that your husband is cheating on you that s a different conversation and it I think there s two levels of that are you concerned for legitimate reasons or are you concerned because of an insecurity that you should work on internally if your husband is Shady and acting shady slap that A A in the face with a A A raw fish and I think you ll be able to know the difference yeah can I see this paper because she had said um I try mentioning how I feel and he tries to justify himself is he missed the fact is he trying to justify himself or is he explaining the situation in a way that should quell your anxiety I do think in a relationship it s important that you feel heard even if the outcome isn t necessarily in your favor so I do think that you need to get him to a place where it s like if you re going to continue to do this I want to know like I like I want XX and X out of it like you re allowed to do this but I want you to check in every few hours or I want to be involved one out of every four times or yeah and I and while I get that I m gon na play Devil s Advocate only because I don t in my own relationship and this is sort of like holding a mirror up to that but I don t think it s I I don t think it s right to treat your partner how you wouldn t want to be treated and I don t know that like having a checklist of items is gon na get rid of your insecurity if you don t work on your own insecurity so it s like for myself I m going to work through it right now I am not being disrespected by Joe s friends not being married that actually has nothing to do with me and now that I stopped them I can t stop them from being single like I can t change that what I can change is making it an assault to my title and status with my husband because that is an insecurity that is born of my own toxic thoughts right yeah because my marriage is valid yeah and I agree with you like giving him a checklist is only going to make him resent you yeah I retract that however I do feel that you need to be here yes and I feel like he needs to understand where you re coming from and so you guys need to be in the middle somewhere and for your own mental Comfort do what I just did which is really A A awful to do but like play Devil s Advocate put yourself in his position unless you think he s a cheating lying piece of A A if he s a cheating lying piece of A A beat him with a A A fish but if you think that for a second this might just be something that s going on for you that s not founded in substantial evidence of him being a shitty person give yourself the relief of am I making this up because it feels like I should make it up because it s annoying and it s okay for it to be annoying but save yourself the emotional grief if there s nothing Beyond it being annoying and good luck to you it s hard to be and I can t imagine being in a long term serious relationship at let alone married because I didn t even know who I was then no so I pray that you guys can come to a solution and grow together and not a part yeah I hope that helps and let s get on to our next question I am years old and have been with my husband for a total of six years ooh subtle Flex I have had three boyfriends before my husband and those relationships were extremely toxic and emotionally draining I have never asked anything from any of my partners but one thing don t watch porn hmm um I don t know why I m so insecure but it s constantly in the back of my mind the idea of my partner looking at another woman getting turned on by another woman and watching another woman to pleasure himself really bothers me it hurts because I believe they are better looking than I am and they are what my partner wants I m attractive healthy and I like sex I know this but I do suffer from body dysmorphia which might be part of the problem I have caught my husband with porn in the past in his computer history twice I didn t intentionally go swoop snooping he has certain programs on there that I use for work the second was within the past year he never apologized but instead said something like well I m sorry it bothers you never said he was sorry for hurting me never tried to talk about it and worst of all never tried to give me reassurance Am I Wrong to not be okay with my partner watching porn Lizzy has talked about it before so I would like to understand how she is okay with it and how she can uh even watch it so there s a couple of things and I think a theme in today is um having good communication with your partner I feel like and I think having a solid foundation within yourself yes because if you re it is hard to bring your bag it s it s not it s impossible to not but yeah but you have to become aware of what you re bringing to the table in terms of baggage I think she is because she stated it pretty plainly and the first thing I want to say is honey you don t deserve those nasty A A thoughts if you are telling yourself that you are not your husband s go to A A spank bank memory but I think that s hard to do when porn is categorized by fetishes so it would be hard to and I have a SIM like I don t mind if Shane watches porn but I m not the kind of couple that like I want to watch porn while we re hooking up together I don t want to do that either and I think a lot of men do like to do that but I do feel for her in the regard that people have a go to when they go on a porn site like you go and my husband s never gon na be a lesbian with me but but my point being is that sa you deserve better than what your mind is telling you you deserve better than what you re just your body dysmorphia is telling you and I hope to God that you can find within yourself the confidence to tell that monster to shut the A A up before even dealing with the fact that pornography bothers you that s a different thing to tackle but you don t deserve the nasty A A your mind is telling you those are lies those are slanderous lies and I think something important in a long term relationship is checking in with each other because you can assume things can get uh routine and then maybe you re not checking in maybe your partner has a fetish or the room he likes yeah that he that he s not vocalizing because you guys are in such a routine so I think maybe uh like becoming each other s fantasies or playing into what each other likes or re checking in and rediscovering each other sexually will also help you feel confident and less worried if he s looking elsewhere I and and that s not to say do something outside of your comfort zone but I also think like the end of her thing is like how I m okay with it and how I can even watch it it s almost like I don t see it it s not a threat to me because it s not a person in the in the room and I don t know like I have a lot of sex worker friends too so it s kind of like normalized for me because I ve you know in the past I ve edited pornography and shot pornography like in not in like a grand way but like if a girlfriend s like hey will you shoot this thing for me I m like yeah I ll shoot that thing for you because I d rather do it than someone you don t know yeah who s gon na steal your footage and sell it because A A that but um for me it s more of like a stimulation tool than it is a threat to the relationship my Integrity in my husband s mind yeah and I personally view it as I I don t think there s like a connection being had or a fantasy being had with this person I think it s very transactional in the sense of like maybe we were both too busy or working a lot and exhausted and I went to bed early and he needed to get off and it s like that doesn t necessarily bother me I don t choose to I don t want to know about it necessarily but it doesn t bother me yeah I mean it doesn t bother me and at the same time like sometimes I d rather jack off than have sex have him jack off no me oh like like you know there s differences it s like sometimes I need to just manage this task really quick and then I m gon na go about my day you know like I used to have a joke in my stand up that I spent a majority of my mental energy wondering whether or not I should masturbate or take a nap and I just find myself sexually frustrated and exhausted because I ve done nothing but I also think like you know I don t if he has that and he needs to go after it he has that need to go after it I don t I don t I mean I don t know honestly I blacked out a little bit at the beginning of my and forgot where I started well he also I think giving somebody an ultimatum is like you can t do this is also a tricky place to be for your partner yeah um I think if he s not rubbing it in your face he s not telling you about it and your sex life is still fulfilling and good yeah I would look inward if you could and try to overcome those demons yourself and maybe ask him to meet like maybe you re not getting all the validation or fulfillment you need from him either maybe if you could be like could you compliment me a little bit more I know that s also it seems like an impossible thing to do but I feel like it s necessary especially if you re like you re saying you have body dysmorphia I know it s like something like Shane I need body validation I don t really need body validation but like coming into a relationship with Shane he needed it more than I needed it but it s something I had to learn because if it s not something I require for myself it s not something that I m just like naturally giving out constantly so when I know that it s something that my partner needs it s something that I try to remember to go out of my way to do and so maybe it s a conversation you guys can have in that regard as well yeah articulate your love language and also inquire about his yeah equal rights yeah well I hope that helped um I also don t love porn that much but I won t say that I ve never look so I mean I m not psycho like I m not like oh let s more poor and more porn more porn but I do think and it s like you know I seek out something that s very specific because I a lot of porn does skeeze me out like it gives me the ick and it makes me uncomfortable that s why I don t like watching Men in porn scenes because more often than not men and porn scenes are portrayed as something that makes me feel like not having sex because it s so aggressive and weird and I m a very tender person who want like I my relationship means so much to me that it s part of the whole part of everything for me like Joe is everything for me which is why I m so mad at Harry Styles for threatening my relationship and I just feel like but no Harry I will not A A you I feel sometimes as though I can feel the production or I can feel the job it just doesn t feel real like although it s like they re pretending they like it I can feel that they don t and it s no I can t wait to be out of this yeah nothing gets me like softer faster yeah and that s why I m always like Googling like tender lesbians loving each other nicely softly lit like that s what I m looking at right well I hope that helped and I hope you all enjoyed today s episode uh don t forget to follow us on social media we re at the Sip official we re also on there personally Lizzy is vlogging every week she uploads on

and they didn t want to A A up their outfits they re pretending it s the happiest place on Earth is it actually honestly you had a good time the best time I ve ever had I believe in magic are you gon na be a Disney adult now I am yeah no you re not yes I am but not in the same sense that believe that bleep that if I bleep it what are they gon na think you said make something I don t know it s not editing hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of the Sip official I m Elizabeth not okay joined by my beautiful co host Ryland Adams hello hello everybody Welcome Back and our dashing Dalmatian cameraman Chris Chris Hi how are you happy to be here he has his mask on and that is because every time you guys come in my boyfriend somehow gets sick are you vlogging right now oh no I was just getting coverage oh sure for sure I m sure that s what she was doing this is off the rails do you have anything to tell us that s streamlined like let s really yeah okay so I ve got three points that I think we ve derailed from already maybe just two back to the first one I for decades my best friend Haley and I have had this song stuck in our heads but we can not A A find it when we Google the lyrics well why don t you use that app that tells you what song you re listening we ve literally because we can t find the song so it s just us saying I want to know which song it is because it s etched in our memories from when we were like and like taking shots in my room and it s by this artist called smooth e smoothie and the lyrics are something like just make sure you don t call before I know it s something dirty it s on the D it s as long as you get gone and none of the folks go all right all right all right okay I but that s all we can remember the punch line the punchline is we ve been for like years literally I m not exaggerating for years we ve been trying to figure out what the A A this song is and the last time I was at our house I was like I m done with this I m sure this man is on Instagram because we literally went through almost every single one of his music videos on YouTube was like this is enough enough this is enough it s been decades I m reaching out to this man directly so this was the beginning of November I DM this A A and I go hi it s sneeling it s the only time I ve ever wished I had a verification check on my name because I was like it s a shot in the boy to fart in the wind this motherfucker s Never Gon na respond I just got a response from him no way he s that s why I was on my phone telling you it s important he s dming me right now and I m probably gon na lose his attention well you re like in connection with him right I m literally talking to this movie right now and does he have another song he said I mean it s on one of my albums guaranteed so just load up on Spotify or apple this is what we ve been doing he s not even gon na tell you which song you know he s like it s on the D are definitely my lyrics what song great A A question I said right but what if this man doesn t know his own song you re kidding me no it s driving me A A crazy smooth this is this is not it bro you were acting like you had an answer I know I felt like I was so close I felt like I was so close where was his song playing that you know it so well uh we would just play it on repeat at my house like we d like Tina kid tell me where your sister lived there s that s Andre Nickatina doesn t matter there s flaws in your storyline if you play it over and over then you obviously knew how to fight because it was on a mixed CD that we like got from somebody else because this was the A A s yeah we re old yeah someone just like burnt it from LimeWire and it s all about that oh my gosh those were the days where you make your mixtapes or your mixed CDs your LimeWire I d be out in the yard playing croquet with my best friends just saying oh man playing croquet are you joking no not at all that s what we would do in high school like on our weekends we d set it up in our yard and we would also we made up our well this is boring yeah it is okay this morning no well you made up your own what oh my God act like that s a violation you loved every second of it I ve never seen it every time I try to have a child with you you act like I m doing something I m not trying to have a child with you but if you re gon na wear a pair of pants where your penis is bulging out of them he walks outside and she goes your penis looks huge today what no he did not think what he went he went no I did my dick back and I was like wow I was thrown off guard I didn t even know my dick was out it s not out it just was bulbous it s bulbous in those pants wow yeah wow we all aspire to be Jon Hamm in sweatpants so it s what honestly we do don t we speaking I was wearing Alicia Marie s vlogmas Pants last night and she James wanted to take a picture of me by the Christmas tree looking cranky and he took it and I looked like I had a John hampinos like it s a it was a big juicy a big juicy dick moment okay I ll have him send the picture it ll be here speaking of Jon Hamm I watched top gun Maverick this weekend you haven t seen it no wow best movie I ve ever seen ever yeah well I m sure I love it I m sure you did it was so fantastic and I hadn t been sleeping on it I just couldn t get Shane to watch it with me but because he s been like down and out and a little bit sick and under the weather I finally got him to watch it and oh my gosh Tom Cruise that mini man he knows how to make a movie Laughter shots fired I bet he s taller no no no no no let me just explain myself I bet he s taller than me I haven t Googled it but I m just saying next is Miles Teller he looks he s a tiny he s a wee he s how tall is he actually can we look into it and how tall is Miles Teller because he looks like a giant I think Miles Teller is like a normal size young man oh my gosh A A was so good it was so good I actually thought about bringing us mustaches to wear for the episode because it s voted movie of the year is From who God knows I don t know just that s a headline they did tension so well I loved the storyline I just could not have you seen yes of course it s been years and years and years so there were some spoilers that I was upset about it s one of the few sequels I think is better than the original it was so good okay wait wait what do you mean spoilers well like you find out that uh that his whatever his what do they call them it s a sequel so anything that happens in the original is not a spoiler bro I m saying I should have watched the first one first but I couldn t Shane didn t have the patience to do that with me God I had seen it but years ago awesome okay and so here I am and I got like that guy s dead and I m like spoiler how tall do you think he is five seven yeah I think so too whoa that s exactly right hell yeah well I say I m five eight Shane and sis I m five seven so me and Tom Cruise are probably the same height I don t think he s miniature I just think Miles Teller is very tall in comparison how tall is Tyler like an even six they didn t even try to give him that box you know to give him like the the how tall do you think Miles Teller is and even six I think six three he that he looks like a monster in that movie I mean six and a half wow six five six no six six and a half like one half like not not even like yeah so I m right ish okay uh brighter than Ryland you know what I m saying what about your Vlog with Chris yesterday oh yesterday s vlogmas is me giving Chris his gay manicure of his dreams that s all you have to say yeah he s here hey Chris I just wanted to touch upon it I hadn t seen that yet what s the thumbnail it didn t pop up yet because it s only Monday today it goes live tomorrow on Tuesday oh my gosh I asked you before the show too and did that go live and you said yeah yesterday I wonder what I thought you were talking about because it definitely was not my vlogmas oh no I said today I thought you meant like whatever it doesn t matter this is boring but Chris do you want to talk about your gay manicure and how it changed your life I mean in a negative way I ve talked well I ve talked about how I ve wanted it on the podcast several times so I ve wanted yeah you wanted the ride yeah and uh yeah it s just a thing I ve wanted forever and then Lizzy shows up and I thought something else completely like completely differently was happening and you can tell them what you thought it was I mean I thought we were making a present for him a present for you and then both of us sat there and we talked to vote you both decided that you don t deserve a present this year because you ve been a naughty boy so Chris and I brought you a basket of coal you re welcome and I was really excited and it was a short lived thing but I was very happy for that period and it was very exciting and I ve never felt cooler you let your freak flag fly Chris wow you re saying boys with painted nails or freaks yes I am wow she s canceling herself all over the place today so since I ve seen you last you ve been a jet Setter I have been everywhere and I m in between and what s ironic is when you were at Disneyland I was like don t you dare bring covid to my house right before Christmas yeah yeah and then and then when I was tired he s like you look like covid you A A well no I think say it because I didn t want you to feel bad if you re already feeling bad but I do feel like you negatively manifested this illness upon yourself for Shane yeah no I feel like you take photos of yourself in the worst position possible for I don t know if it s for pity or for no sometimes I m just shocked by the way that I look when I wake up it s like where do you go when you re sleeping A A why are you so A A up in the morning even Chris s response was a little like hey are you okay girl honestly that s how I wake up all the time and I m like what like because it s rough you re lucky Joe wakes up after you honestly sometimes we don t even sleep in the same room together and I m like Ugh what what goes on like where is he doing this to me is he just like taking me and dragging me through a A A field of thistles okay so take us through the highlights of your trips well first and foremost I don t have like an actual recall of a time that I went to Disney and it was like you know we re here for Lizzie s childhood dreams it s always a chore in my like every time I ve gone it s like playing tourist for somebody else and I have like so many things going on I ve never got to go just for fun for the fun of it yeah so I picked two of my funnest friends okay thank you very much yeah that was definitely a jab you know I m not that fun honestly I probably wouldn t pick me either I m like can we go back home and watch top gun Maverick no I think you re very fun if I went with you I don t think we could do it to back to back days I think we would probably just get park hopper passes and not do everything okay and then spend the night at the hotel and drive home or just walk in the hotel room and then go home okay so what was so magical I went with a friend of mine Shannon whose engagement I tried to ruin um let s ruined her honeymoon did I tell you that they want so remember when I ruined her in proposal they got engaged at uh uh Disney World and I found a Costco yesterday we were trying to go and then you almost ruined the bachelorette party too true because you were like what you have planned is boring to the bridesmaid okay she goes I think we should go to Vegas well here s the deal the she had pitched that we get A A up in the bride s mom s basement the week of the wedding yeah call me crazy but I don t think a bachelorette trip should be the week of the wedding in case somebody Falls over and needs to have teeth replaced and also like the mom s basement I mean I m not dog like it might be a great baseball yeah it could be something more fun it was a lot it was a lot and also the basement didn t exist anymore the mom had moved out of the house with the basement it was and it s good that I had some pushback on that okay because I also knew that the bride it doesn t matter so she says they re going to Tahiti for their honeymoon and then I open my inbox and I have A A coupons for flights to Tahiti oh should I meet you there these are crazy cheap it s under round trip for a little old me I could just stay in the room that s what I m saying including flights yeah no way it s not even for you guys to come here I know both flights round trip for me to go to Tahiti I was like I m A A there dude and she s like no Lizzy I just took a scream and hate you literally literally I took a screen grab and sent it to Jordan and I don t think he even responds to me anymore but that s fair I love you Jordan you re a good man he s a good man I have to say that Jordan is a good man okay so your standout s from Disneyland with Shannon I went with Shannon were they really pumping sex that s sense I couldn t tell okay but maybe it s the covid talking and then gotcha didn t even blink he s like whatever bring it on um no I couldn t really smell the scents like even in the Haunted Mansion where you re supposed to smell the gingerbread like it didn t really um Laughter lately tube which is the only common like thing I ve had every time I ve had to go anyway um great I could smell the pot I could smell the popcorn okay this sucks man I had the best A A pickle of my life the better than the ones we have here yes so we can stop getting them you can still try to get them to Disneyland I mean no we ll be getting them today um and with my really great friends Sarah so the two of them Sarah is a planner and Shannon is a Disney A A so between the two of them they executed the best hours of my life and I m not even cheating you we did at least at least hours at the parks wow yeah I was not I was not well afterwards I m very I m like my body hurts did you have some good food besides the pickles we ate all day at California Adventure Park I don t know if you know this but California Adventure Park the like the moral of the story is food well yeah I watch YouTubers that specifically go to theme parks and like hit all the food stations inside of theme parks because I m always like see I should have on that I d seen a tick tock of a girl in Disney in the Disney park who asked all of the workers what their favorite holiday food treat was and so she went and got all those and she s like taking bites of them and it s like making my mouth water watching this A A eat this huge macaroon so I told the girls like my objective today is to get everything that this A A got and we go there they re disgusting they re disgusting the macaroons don t get them you don t need a macaroon that big and also they re not that good hmm she had like three cubes I ve never I never trusted macaroon I had never met a macaroon that I like like I never swear by them and I m just like what s the deal no they suck they suck yeah A A a macaroon unpopular opinion I hate a macaroon yeah most popular here Chris you want to be the odd man out go ahead be controversial I dare you it s not a safe space I think they re okay there s nothing to like about them yeah what do you like about them I don t know they re kind of right I ve had some tasty one what do you think a macaron is isn t it like the pretty thing with the thing in the middle yeah yeah well it looks like a krabby because he thinks we re all so stupid I mean I mean how could you say that they re okay but I have to assume you don t know what it is I went to one restaurant where they were very soft and the filling in the middle was actually tasty and it was like bring sand to the beach oh okay so we re in line This is after fireworks The Last Ride we re gon na do is the Matterhorn we re in line for a A A ever even though we have Genie passes this girl behind us is like having this gnarly conversation with this guy about why she didn t bring her boyfriend with her to Disneyland and she looks him dead ass in the eyes and goes I mean why would I bring my boyfriend to Disneyland do you bring sand to the beach and I was like she insinuating that she s here to A A around on her boyfriend or her boyfriend is Disneyland because Sans at the beach no the point is like why would you bring your boyfriend who you like have sex with to Disneyland where you could have sex with all of the eligible men at Disneyland but it s like I don t think there s any eligible man at Disneyland trying to A A like I don t know like I ve never thought like I need dick where am I gon na go Disney I mean is that a thing I don t know there is a date a Disney dating app like Disney has curated their own dating app so for other and you have to get um you have to qualify it s like Raya but you have to like answer enough Disney questions and tell you and like validate that you love Disney enough to be on the Disney dating app that s a lot to take in that s a lot to take in at this hour of the morning I also have to say I we went so hard and I m I was wearing like baggy pants that were sort of rubbing against my thighs and my thighs were rubbing against each other I m chafed I m shaped to the Gods like hurts like we were walking to the car the other day I was like Jesus is like back of your legs hurt like their thighs I pulled my pants down it s look it looks like I ve been like riding a A A horse why didn t you wear like biker shorts why would I think to wear biker shorts so you don t chase I didn t know I would chafe in my life pants and pants yes that s what I m trying to tell you I thought chafing was because your Skin s rubbing again I thought so too so it s not chafing you got like a weird rash from like un like you got a UTI or something well don t you always say if you don t shower after Orange Theory you re gon na get something bad what a yeast infection so you got that no it s a chafed I don t know how you would do that like I don t either against your pants yeah I ve never chafed in my life I couldn t tell you I m not a doctor okay but it was crazy and wild and out of control and that was my Disney Experience see you later bye I m sorry my arms cramping from holding my body up I can t I know this is really not it this positioning we thought oh it would be so funny I m just not gon na look in front of the Christmas my back is like all walked out of place we re in our s like are you A A kidding me we re gon na hold our bodies up for an hour eat ass bro get out of here we re gon na if we want to do this setup again we have to change the chairs yeah I don t even know if I can do that for the second minutes of this show I know it hurts so bad I m like we have to be coming up on that minute mark because it s okay your Nashville trip it s only been minutes oh my God okay this is the worst podcast episode we ve ever been apart I don t think so I think it s fine I think it s awful I think it s really good I think we should do it I think if by the end of the video If smoothie gets back to me and tells me the name of that goddamn A A song it ll be a win for everyone oh my God now he s non blocked no you re not no I m not okay um you started to binge write Lotus yeah I get it now what whoa yeah you know what I went back last night as well before I saw you had written that on the document because of the immense fomo that I have felt from watching everyone talk about how much they re just like edging to White Lotus yeah and I just felt so left out because I had replayed like the fourth episode of the first season seven times and I still never made it through yeah I mean I m never gon na go back to the first season but no spoilers because I well I binged it all yesterday so you skipped the first season yeah A A the first season you don t need anything to do with it but I then I almost started doing that but then I saw Jennifer Coolidge is also in the second season I was like What if I missed something from this character they re basically they re virtually unrelated okay except for it s a White Lotus Hotel and Jennifer Coolidge is in it and is she the same character yes okay so she survives spoiler alert geez well right anyway without any more without any more spoilers I ve been the entire season yesterday was super excited because this guy was doing a gambling pool of who do you think s gon na die and I wanted to participate I think it is and it s like we re not even friends I just don t have another friend that I know that watches the show ing him as if we ve been like we ve spent more than like one awkward party together where he was a plus one and I was a plus one like we have nothing in common me and this man regardless he stopped responding to me I just wanted to speculate with a buddy anyhow I fell asleep before the end of the episode and I said and I was dead so I keep ruining so the point is someone dies yes that s the whole point of the show bro well I didn t know that each season opens with a dead body and they don t show you who it is and you have to like watch and like put together your hype your guesses of who who the body is see I m gon na have to go back and start the first season again because I don t even remember who that body was in the first time I mean go ahead and enjoy yourself but again you don t have to do that they re completely unrelated Chris are you watching the White Lotus no Chris only watches Reasons Why and that s my th reason I ve never even heard of it if I m being honest wow really yeah it s not all you see on Instagram about it in front of you multiple times oh from you guys from you guys maybe alone outside what yeah I ve never heard about it interesting okay sorry thank you for your apology accept um I don t have anything exciting to report really my life has just been consumed what s going with your gopher holes my gopher holes yeah what do you mean have you literally already forgotten that you had you put Turf over your no you already forgot out my story because they had put gopher protection before the turf what they had done was nailed them yes I m asking about that they fixed the leaks great we re good to go awesome when we get back to LA the animals will be swimming in the pool stop looking at me eyes on Chris should we just trade sweaters for the next podcast Laughter you know I want that sweater that s what it would be everything on this how s your mental health during vlogmas are you good am I good haha no I ve missed a couple of postings I ve missed all posting wow but I m gon na I m gon na make it I m gon na make up for it I m gon na make it it s fine I m not so it s like it s not like it s over and I don t have the opportunity to just post what I meant to post that yesterday but mine s the post production that I just can t keep up with I feel like I m sitting at my computer all day every day and I did try out an editor how d it go because you know like as we said if you never start going in the right direction I m gon na be sitting at my desk for the rest of my life yeah but he the editor was good it was a good edit it just wasn t my edit and I m not saying like I m an outstanding editor that s not what I m saying but I think because when I m filming I m storyline producing in my head and I already know the beats and I ve already been editing my Vlogs for so long I just really think it would take somebody that s like working alongside me to really get the beats and The rhythms and the way that I like to punch into whatever s going on um and I don t know that anyone s just going to get that naturally with me sending an hour and a half of raw footage right so I ve just accepted my fate as an editor for them so so there you have it wow this podcast sucks Laughter I did do one episode where I or episode what is it called a vlogmas I did a vlogmas where Mr bubs don t start stop barking in the background and I might just not post it because it s so awful I had someone come over and we were making gingerbread houses and he s just like this hey Lizzy had to explain to her dad what our end oh you A A her that A A is so annoying I m still annoyed by the way when he was you remember that when he was doing that yeah I took out of the episode yeah I yeah just talk about clicking out you A A my dad texted me what s art who s RN I was like right now he goes no what s RN I go right now he says what does rn mean I said RN means right now he s saying right now because he s awful and did he understand finally dude I don t know I just had to give up is he using it in his day to day life nobody s using it in their day to day language I was more so in a mood it wasn t like my new personality trait yeah and everyone took it so seriously the problem is it s not your new personality trait this is just who you ve always been wow and that s the problem wow you re a nightmare well if you ever want to have sex with me again you re gon na have to bring me a gift Laughter we ve never had sex that s a lot that s such a lie and you know it you don t want to admit to them here and now that you were the one because I m not a gold star wait what do they call that a unicorn no they call a gold star gold star I m not a lesbian whatever we never had sex don t do this to me unless it gets me a Wikipedia page is the only woman to ever have sex with Rylan Adams I ll take it I ll take whatever I can get via Wiki pages okay and with that we ll see you guys in a minute oh we ve got three minutes no we have nothing to say Lizzy this I m you want to talk now you didn t get me a Christmas present oh yeah I m really awesome I m still waiting for my wedding gift from a year and a half ago and Chris got my A A couch do you not think I m generous enough in the day to day world no no I really do I did have gifts lined up for you and here s where I will say like I keep like well I m a Taurus so like if I work hard at all I m like I have to tell everyone how hard I work dude me to making your present

tree we ve ever gotten it s like just thin enough but it s like perfectly the height is perfect for this room and there are already maybe presents in front of this show and a Louis Vuitton duffel bag all wrapped and gorgeous and let me tell you not one of these is a gift from me to anyone Shane s been like done and he s had these wrapped in his office forever and kept begging me to go get a trees like I have to get the tree so I can finally put the present somewhere and all my gifts are sitting upstairs in boxes and yeah I haven t Christmas shop for any of my friends yet is this duffel bag for me that was actually a gift to Shane from someone so who well I don t know if I should say it out okay are you done yeah I am giving you a Christmas gift though I already have your ideas okay I just have to send it to your house I ll take that I ll take that to the bank and smoke it and then I said I m so sorry like I wanted to do a gift exchange for the Vlog and you were like well this isn t going to be every year I just got excited about one thing no I said this is gon na be every year oh wow it s gon na be every year oh wow it s super sweet too wow I m gon na feel horrible I hope you do

Elizabeth you re kidding me right now huh you re kidding me excuse me you kidding me Aaron all right yes okay first of all we re in a much comfortable much more comfortable positions I was literally about to break my back I might need to go get realigned like should we go to the Joint after this A A yeah we should that would be nice let s go two girls that get snatched two girls one crack foreign Laughter no Lizzy was being so demanding during the break it was crazy yeah right Chris and I are both like hauling down these heavy chairs and Lizzy s like melting into the LoveSac being bring me my DC bring my DC oh my God you did say DC because I said what is that a disgusting behavior and honestly on behalf of myself I would like to apologize to everybody move the bag move the bag what bag honestly that doesn t sound like me Riley has been really good she doesn t chew household objects right but she is a A A no oh I didn t know where you were going with us after we re talking about me when other people come over she gets very excitable and I think luggage is something that like she can t contain herself right from and so last time you were here you had left your guest door open and she had chewed your brand new laptop charger to nothing A A I feel like my door s open right now too that s exactly what I m gon na tell you oh I bought her laptop charger and guess what she does what she goes up there and rudely throws her stuff all over the ground and leaves the door open for Riley to eat everything so I have to replace it again that s your Christmas present thank you I think okay let s get into some hot topics all right okay Drew Barrymore says she isn t buying Christmas gifts for her daughters I hate it you would and honestly on the way here I was thinking wow I don t know if my kids can be friends with rylan s kids rude is it yeah I mean the only reason why is because I don t want my kids to have some sort of like opening thing about Christmas I love that for your kids but I don t want my because like I m kind of that way too and it s awful what way I like to have a A A ton of things to open on Christmas like I love gifts I like getting them but at the end of the day like I don t need anything and then it just turns into a bunch of like mess and A A that I have to re gift later I don t think it s about the amount or what like I and I don t want to spoil my kids like I want my kids to learn the value of a dollar I m going to do what my parents did to me which was like and I know this is a little later in life but it s like if you want to have a car if you want to have fun if you want to do these things you need to have a job to pay for all of your bills like your car insurance your gas your phone bill like if you want to have those luxuries you need to go find a way to pay for them to teach them responsibility that being said I do love Christmas and I will for sure get them gifts I don t think I m gon na go like crazy crazy crazy but I definitely like like the idea of playing into Santa and doing all of these things but Drew Barrymore had said well she gets her her kids gifts throughout the year it s just not like Christmas isn t an organized gift Opera like moment and she said I m not like some weird strict cold Mom I just feel like a better gift would be a life memory I d rather invest in that than a dollhouse or something and it all evens out so it s fine yeah so she said that throughout the year she ll take them on uh trips and I m sure a Drew Barrymore vacation is fabulous lit but I bet she would do that regardless and the kids would come along anyway I just think it is a little bit that s just my phone oh I I m surprised I guess they already live such a wonderful life I m sure that Drew provides them a great one I mean like even I m not even talking about like on a celebrity millionaire scale I m from like something I talked about with Joe this year was like I noticed that he will go out of his way to pack the tree with gifts and I m kind of like I don t know like drained by it like I don t I don t I honestly do not need anything because you then feel like you have to match it you feel like you have to match it there s this pressure and this burden put upon ensuring that there s gifts under the tree as if that qualifies your love for a person and I just don t think that s true yeah I agree and I think it s a beautiful I think for me I m saying for me I don t want to enforce my opinion on everybody but like I was trying to tell Joe like in our house like I would love to change the dynamic like stocking stuffers are fun I like a practical stocking stuffer like Legos yeah like an activity like a rocket ship for kids where you fill it with A A and it explodes it s like I love that yeah those that are craft gifts that are our experiences in themselves and I do think I just think something to open it doesn t have to be big or extravagant or expensive you could have crafted it or it could be a Lego set like you re saying I just think if you celebrate Christmas giving something to enhance that day to feel special to create an environment I personally enjoy I mean I mean I totally get it and like as a kid like my God Mom would go above and beyond putting herself in debt to ensure I got everything that I ever asked for that year but the point being is like as a little kid I didn t want any of the things I was asking for I was asking for things because I saw other kids getting things and I guess that s enlarged the problem because right you re Drew Barrymore s kids not getting presents I needed a Teletubby I d never seen a A A episode of it a day in my life I don t give a A A about the Teletubby but like every other I was like all these A A are getting Teletubbies we do go to school you do go to school and everyone else is like what did you get for Christmas and I went up the talking point and I want to like find a way to like arm my kid with the like the mindset of if I don t need it to for X Y or Z reason and I don t mean need it like you need to A A apply pressure to a bleeding wound I mean like do you need those shoes like do you love those shoes and you need those shoes you know what I mean right because sometimes like sure you don t need a pair of checkered Vans but your heart would feel a little bit better had you had them you know what I m saying yeah so things like that like I love the idea of doing that for gifts but it s like this year like I couldn t tell you one A A thing I need like that yeah and so and when I feel Joe buying things first I m like well pump the brakes don t just buy me something to buy me something right I love waking up early and getting breakfast in the morning or making breakfast in the morning I love doing Legos all day and you can I look forward for a A A height yeah with your family outside of the gifts like your day doesn t have to center around the gifts themselves yeah and I also feel like I spent years going home with just like a trunk full of trash that someone spent hundreds of dollars on and it s just like don t do that yeah don t do that are you doing gifts with your significant other Chris what will you guys do this is your first Christmas together right um yeah so I I got gifts for basically everyone in this family because I love them and we ve become very close and they all like cute little things like they all have a thing yeah and uh I don t want to say what those things are when this goes up I don t want to ruin it but yeah I got them all like cute little personal things that I just think they re gon na be excited about and I m this is the most excited I ve been for Christmas in several years it s like I m very I m very very excited and that s what I think is fun is getting excited and that s why I think having a kid like Shane and I already love Christmas so much I think like bringing Christmas traditions to a child will be so fun for us and give us so much joy but I I do agree with you like spending money to spend money isn t it but I do think like when you re shopping if something really like tickles you thinking about somebody else that s the gift to get them because it s not just gon na go in the trash it s like like it s just been too many years for me of like going compulsory like yeah compulsory Christmas shopping and it s just like I m getting this because they need something to open but they don t A A want or need this well I know some couples do the thing where they like pick a destination and go on a vacation well that or they like write a list of things that they actually need like things that are gone well that takes all the fun out of it I agree I got I did get Joe a couple things because after we have this big talk shows like shut the A A up A A I already got you the things you ve texted me to get you and I was like that is you say yeah I don t need gifts but I ve texted Joe an exact list of all the things but so I got Joe a couple of things but I know he will like them yeah so you know what I doesn t it doesn t matter I m just saying like I want to know the way to train a kid to not feel bad or left out if they don t have exactly what another person has because that s all life is if you re constantly doing this comparative thing of like I want what others have you never appreciate what you do have I mean and I think that s so sad I think that s everyone s present day struggle right at any age yeah yeah you re right and it s devastating like it took me this long to be like wait a A A I ve always had what I love you know what I mean like and that is just like the the feeling of like a home and like a community and a family like that is to me what I I ve always wanted and I have that now yeah so to find that sort of comfort and reassurance I guess that s like an everyday struggle for a family to make a kid feel like it is a home and a community whatever but I don t know I just I guess I don t want my children to feel the way that I felt as a kid but I think that s also just part of my condition and my journey right yeah no it all makes sense having kids is A A scary it really is did I tell you we re not gon na do Elf on a Shelf are you gon na do Elf on the Shelf I still don t really understand the concept of elf on a shelf because I just hear people talking about it and then I m annoyed that they re so annoyed and so passionate about it that I ve never actually looked into what it actually is I think they just have an elf that s like mischievous and he has like magic and if you re not good he ll A A your A A up but even if you are good he ll A A your A A up well but yeah I mean from what I understand basically there s like it s an elf that s come down like on behalf of Santa to watch the kids and make sure you re being good it s Christmas actual report card for if you ve been naughty or nice yeah like he s watching you to be like are you and so then but they re all so bad the parents like the elf saw what you did well the elf is also mischievous because I see on Tick Tock like parents like dipping the elephant like Nutella and rubbing A A all over their kids while they sleep yeah the elves are all mischievous what yeah excuse me my friend I m not my friend well yeah my friend my friend and boss at my old job would go so crazy with Elf on the Shelf she d spend like a lot of money on like the elf painted the walls green and like there d be a bucket of paint next to the elf and the walls were painted and then oh my gosh things like too much I thought I was an intense Christmas person and I don t know if I can hang with that yeah no but I m gon na do switchblade Santa with that little Santa guy that we just got at that yard sale that terrifying guy and we re gon na make a little clay switchblade for him that he holds in his hand and one morning the kids are gon na come out after they re bad and I m gon na have myself all bound up with like a little gag in my mouth hey help mommy you were mad and when your bad switch played Santa gets Mommy so they re always good or Mommy gets hurt that s crazy is it I think you should think about that I don t think it s as crazy as A A days of elf on a shelf acting like somebody came in and and if they re back to you if they re bad mommy s gon na get switchblade Santa okay so watch your back all right what s the next topic the next next topic is uh damn I added this when I was gon na watch the whole series on it but I didn t Taylor Swift fans plan to sue Ticketmaster there s a series on it there was like a you know date a version of Dateline oh maybe that Insider thing that you A A with doesn t matter Taylor Swift fans are livid about the Ticketmaster thing I saw a particularly sad young girl the scream crying her mom s swimming her she s like I was Taylor s biggest fan Runner Tumblr page I stood by her when everyone was making fun of her at all never be able to afford to see a show and I know it s not Taylor s fault I m not mad at Taylor I m just sad like so A A sad I mean so that is more valid than I think the other outrage like I think you re allowed to be sad that you can t get it but and I don t know the details I I tried to listen the way I mean and I got so bored I think the details on it are it s like it s become a monopoly of who sells tickets so they I m not an economist and twenty thousand dollars are what some of these tickets are going for all on Ticketmaster like Ticketmaster yes and it s insane they re getting the re were they reserving tickets yes so they get a bunch of tickets for resale and robots are buying a bunch of tickets for resell because that s how the system works and so now they re marked up to an absurd position where you the when they first went on sale for pre sale there are so many people in line to get them that they could not all secure them at the at the standard pricing level I believe and then Ticketmaster or who the A A ever Dr and were behind that debacle and now the other side of it is they re going on resale for like you know cheap tickets are like three grand and medium level tickets are twenty thousand see like I ve seen tickets for Grand and it s hard I tried watching like I don t know who the A A gon na buy that I tried watching accredited news source to actually get the facts but they were like circling around facts too yeah so I like couldn t tell what was real and then they were saying like yeah Ticketmaster has become a monopoly and like yes I don t know the actual fraud inside of an alleged Monopoly that could be not about fraud so Monopoly means you own all of the options for it and I guess if you were going into business good business would mean you would want to take over the market but now that s looked down upon it s not that it s looked down upon it s that it s literally illegal like we do not do monopolies in America but there are other ticketing companies how could Taylor Swift award see I don t know the legalities of this how could she give Ticketmaster the soul right to every ticket for everything I think it s a Ticketmaster might own a majority of all of the other things see I don t know how the ticketing space works either but when they use words like Monopoly it means that this day run the market on it and that s bad for capitalism they could be people that have Tick Tock accounts and they re not credible at all so it s not just them though do you know what I mean I know but like in New York did I tell you yeah but even they like well I didn t read the New York Times but I was watching ABC and NBC s reports on this and they were talking and it still made no sense and I don t even I m not even sure they knew what they were talking about yeah I think part of it is because it s like the semantics of it are not interesting I think and the bottom line is it shouldn t be that expensive to go to a A A concert I agree and I also think that when I mean this has been a like take Ticketmaster out of it if there s a really popular event there are people for their jobs that buy them go to resale sites and resell that yeah when there s millions of people trying to get tickets to stops or whatever it is of course they re gon na get sold out and of course people are going to try to buy them the difference is what you re talking about is like in a world of fairness and the the variation here is that there is an unfair element okay I guess I just don t know what the I I d have to know what ticket Master is doing to make it unfair right but we re too bored to find that out but we ll still talk to you about it listen Laughter in other Taylor Swift news she said to make her debut uh directorial feature film debut with a script she wrote yes wow and it s already picked up by Spotlight features I believe yeah good for her I like that I mean who knows she ll probably make a cameo I don t think she ll star in it I mean she s been in other movies like New Year s Eve well cats I think the Valentine s Day one oh here I was about to be like you know what I love that she s not trying to be the star and that she just has a Creative Vision I mean she wasn t trying to be a star in those pieces either oh was she not just because like she s like Lady Gaga has become such like I m trying to make Oscar movies yeah now Harry Styles is acting and I I don t hate him for it if I was Harry Styles or Lady Gaga I d be doing the exact same thing but to me like Taylor wanting to direct really like I think she loves to tell stories like she does that through her songwriting and I think now uh turning to directing I think she will be great because she knows how to like completely tell a story yeah and like she said in the announcement of it or somewhere that she had been on the set of plus music videos well she s been directing her music videos yeah and before that I think she just really took an interest in how the story was being told visually which led her to direct her own music videos which has been like a progression into doing a feature film of her own and I think she ll be great at it yeah it s also so A A empowering I love it yeah I love it for her I also A A was I gon na say did you see Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde broke up broke up I saw the headlines I didn t click I ve lost interest I mean I never click either but like I think that he might be A A around with Kendall Jenner again wow because she broke up with her Devin Booker yeah wow yeah wow could you believe because honestly they were at his show a few nights ago and people are speculating that her Haley Bieber and Kylie were all rolling I mean who cares me obviously I m sure they were they re year olds yeah they re like remember when we were yeah and Downing bottles of wine is too wow Haley Bieber always has a health issue I saw another headline pop up that she has another health issue and one of her thirties I don t mean to like say that flippantly I just mean like but she s not well either we re all not well I mean I don t want to compare my problems to Haley Bieber she s had harder problems than me different she didn t she she had brain issues and now she said recently she has like a cyst on her ovary or something I love Haley Bieber let me just come out as Pro Haley Bieber okay that s nice of you to come out as Pro someone when I can feel that you re about to drag someone else you re wrong about that no I m I don t think I am you personally you literally hate on the docket and I was like nothing good you think I hate this person which person Jennifer Lawrence no look down one more oh I know you re about to be nasty I wasn t going to be nice then why did you put it on the list why did you put somebody you violently hate on the list to talk about bro bro I would not say I violently hate him I would say I m not a huge fan of his but you ll consume everything he does with hate in my heart yeah exactly that s called hate watching and that s why I went I don t think it s violent bro he s getting money off my view okay if anything it s like a charitable act on my part if I truly hated this person I would consume none of it I just thought that I learned something interesting okay well lead us into the story first so there have been a multitude of Evan Hansen s right because there s it s a play oh right so one guy so I ll talk to Chris so that you know how in a play they recast people to play the role because they don t play it until they die yes so there have been multiple Evan Hansons yes there are I believe two sets four Evan Hansons who are dating what yes wait wait I m sorry you were bored by this story I m talking to Chris is the is it a love story between two men between yes I hate bro I don t hate Broadway but I m not I don t I m not versed Evan Hansen is a man okay and so there have been four I don t know how many total but there are four dear Evan Hansen s and they re couples oh and and oh that plot just got engaged to another Evan Hansen they re engaged now okay so Evan Hansen doesn t have a lover in the play that he follows straight but it s so it s a woman in the play but the four these are four gay men who have played Evan Hansen in dear Evan Hansen I understand two are engaged now and two are a couple wow see that s A A wild right they re all into them their own type like they re all jacking off to themselves I A A hate Ben Platt just kidding that s sick and twisted right because probably they probably all have four does he look this same as his fiance pull it up show us Ben and whatever just just say Ben Platt s lover show us show us but isn t that interesting and so he is and wow that s crazy crazy you take it all back you don t even know me I surprise you from time to time every once in a while you bring it closer we can t see him they re both oh gosh when you don t have anything nice to say oh right I m talking about fashion not not them oh not how they look or anything yeah it s the it s that uh Ben s the perm version of his boyfriend it is like looking in a mirror when they re having sex so they re just like you re so hot I m so hot I mean you re hot too yeah I ve never been attracted to someone that looked anything like me very interesting all right we don t have time for all this Googling I just want to see all the Evan Hansen boyfriends and see if they re all like twinning while she s busy have you heard about spoiler at the spoiler alert spoiler I forgot the movie it s a gay Christmas movie with a guy from Big Bang Theory I m very excited oh a gay Christmas movie the guy from Big Bang Theory yeah when s it out I think it s out is it the guy that plays gay frequently or that is gay but also plays gay frequently yeah in Ryan Murphy s stuff yeah yes wow okay I ll hope it s better than Bros what s his name I forgot his name here um okay you can Google Jennifer Lawrence okay so Jennifer Lawrence uh clarifies a comment on female lead action movies she sort of fumbled the ball while she was talking to Viola Davis and she said I remember when I was doing Hunger Games no one had ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn t work uh we were told and so that s something she said and it s obviously not true because well before Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss Everdeen there were women in action films yeah Wonder Woman there s so many Catwoman all of them yeah but the point being is um did the internet get their panties in a bunch yeah of course the internet got their parties in a bunch but Jennifer Lawrence was like I A A fumbled the ball guys I was talking to one of my A A Heroes of course I m gon na say something wrong she wasn t even trying to say that it was like the sentiment of it because we do hear that a lot women can t women can t women can t women can t we hear it all the A A time right and the facts of the matter are it s like what I was talking to you about when I was doing your nails Chris women A A can because we have like and we will and we couldn t will continue to because it s and that s the thing that I think people really need to understand I think when we get bogged down in the semantics of Oppression it s like that becomes oppressive if you think women can t just look at Reese Witherspoon and you ll be like damn yeah women can do anything and look at all the women before Reese Witherspoon a woman directed American Psycho like a woman was the first like I believe one of the first directors was a woman so it drives me A A crazy easy when people start saying that women can t do these things and it s like stop getting in our minds making us think that it s harder than it actually is yes representatively we are lacking in numbers so give us the opportunity to have those numbers but stop telling us we A A can t and give her a break give Jennifer Lawrence a break and give Jayla a break I love that she gives herself a break more than anything though because I think we all live in constant fear of saying something wrong but it s always ridiculous like it s all like let people be because the sentiment is probably there throughout her entire career of like oh they re not gon na let you do this so they re not gon na let you like she dropped her huge big I think she was with CAA and she dropped them because she kept finding out that these uh these films and screenplays weren t being sent to her from filmmakers she loved she was like my agents just were like bypassing them and not telling me that they were doing such and when I found out I left and went to a smaller agency because I want to make projects I love like I m not here to be like some big product of a corporation yeah I want to make things I love so I like that she stands up for herself and just like is herself yeah and I think that s a really beautiful thing what else did oh she did you also see she dropped out of the Adam McKay movie that was gon na be uh no but I love that she dropped out of it I would too she was like Amanda Seyfried already did everything that needed to be done wow done slate also I m so sick of there being a documentary a movie a TV show and a movie of the same A A real life story but Dropout was fantastic Dropout was fantastic but we don t need the documentary the television series and the movie and they re still gon na make the movie you know what I mean well maybe some people do and you can just choose which one you want to see they re fine did you watch Casey Anthony a little bit yeah I haven t seen it yet I have a controversial opinion what I don t think she did it well I think so that is even when Shane was watching it uh he was like and I was not gon na watch it well and that he was like you start watching it and you start believing her you start thinking oh she didn t do it but then after he did it he went on another Deep dive and there s all these recordings I guess that weren t in that that really do make her seem guilty I haven t gone on the Deep dive myself yet damn I wish Shane was feeling well now I do want to see him wow Music get that A A on the phone um oh here s another talking about change of opinion I ve watched a majority do you like Megan now there s no way in hell I know it s A A A A you like Meghan Markle I think it s more no no no are you kidding me RN never come back are you kidding me I m not kidding you I don t like her I hate her last wow yeah Joe won t let me play it while he s in the house this is editing and manipulation on their part though absolutely and I m a A A victim I am a A A victim of their love story the way that they tell it swear to God I ve been wanting to watch that too but Shane was a hard no so see this is why I m so grateful you re coming back to Cali like we need each other we need each other we need each other this is A A stupid but yeah I feel differently okay I mean there s still like super processed A A like affected like listen like I ve just always been an activist like when I finally got my start on suits like the producers were like Megan you are an activist huh I m gon na have to watch it I mean she s she was an international relations major or maybe her her mom was and they say it in a way that you think it s they re talking about her um anyway yeah my feelings are changing wow I still feel like Harry s a victim Laughter I hate it here that was the most disgusting thing that s ever come out of me like quite honestly I don t know if that s true okay you have four minutes to hit us with these last topics okay too hot to handle uh okay this is a twofer okay there s a guy on too hot for handle who did not tell his mother that he s what he said too hot for handle whatever the point of the story is this boy lied to his mother about being on the show because it s A A upsetting I d be so upset if my child was on too hot for handle how is he gon na keep that up I mean now she knows oh what is the premise or you re just you re no you re a sexy you re a Sex Fiend and you go on a show about being a Sex Fiend where you can t have sex or you lose money Chris this sounds like the show for you no everybody s chiseled and skinny and beautiful oh my gosh he s come on come on it s big men okay you mean his preference isn t on isn t represented on the show his preference is not represented on the show is what I mean oh it definitely was like ugly is this where like Tana s boyfriend emerged from yeah I don t know if it s her boyfriend but the guy she s always hairy hairy Jazzy so then I should go on the show because I d win easily because I d be attracted to nobody yes exactly so they just put a bunch of hot sex obsessed people in a room together and say they don t have that as hell so should I be watching you would love it okay um anyway that plus Lottie Moss got a A A face tattoo back to having kids is A A horrifying can you imagine if you have a kid and they grow up to have a face tattoo and go on too hot to handle what s the face tattoo say does it matter well did they get it for did she get it for the show is she s a model like her mom Kate Moss oh my God wait her mom is Kate mom yes okay I didn t I didn t and she got drunk one night like blackout drunk and woke up with a A A face tattoo and now she s going on too hot to handle no two different people bro the point being children are terrifying and sneaky little A A that ll ruin the lives you ve gave in them yeah so don t get them too many Christmas presents and this is why you don t give them Christmas presents pcas oh the I I think I m just getting old because I don t care about award shows anymore what is the PCOS the uh People s Choice Awards oh it happened the other night what is that it s just like the you know is it a real one though I mean yeah for what I mean People s Choice pop culture it s not like uh accredited like sag Award right but like what do you get like what is it for the people vote we have seconds we got ta go and that s the Sip toodles A A yes bye Music thank you
Music so Music camera speeds yeah one of us has too much blush on uh marker this is what happens when you force me to perform after the organic fact whatever guys this is what i look like i m a new mother it s serving blush it s serving pride i saw i saw wow chris just is that girl he is ready oh you have a lot of you re gon na have to turn that viewfinder around too well lizzie can t look at her oh yes yes yes i m not allowed that privilege when art when do you look at the viewfinder you act like you ve ever looked at the viewfinder i would like to check every once in a while since when since i never because i m marginally i was just gon na say it feels so good to be together that i don t even want to fight with you today but you re already picking fights with me i would love to look at the viewfinder but i m not allowed because you don t let us no it s because i want to have an intimate moment with the potmas the podium we re not going to call out anything that i say wrong today because i am a A A mess okay let s make a deal um the reason why i can t is because it s an impulsive thing that i m out of control of i know i know sorry so i realized that i m a horrible gay lizzy texted me after last week s episode and she goes you know it s pride month right and i was like oh yeah i opened instagram this morning that s all i could see listen i love pride i love that people love love regardless if it s uh different than a man and a woman only right but sometimes i do feel and this is like a little bit of a hot take that a lot of people s intention is for attention or for money but then i thought about it you re talking about target right i love target so i m not i love target too but i definitely feel like target is uh running amok okay let s go with gay pride let s go away from target because i love target so much and if they ever wanted to work with me A A anywhere i d run towards them i heard in burger king in the uk has a A A gay pride sandwich that has two bottoms and then they have one that has two tops they do yeah wow and that s an interesting combination because those don t work out they obviously don t have a gay person on that team because that relationship is a fail no hold on there s no coming back from that relationship and it s going to end wouldn t that make every A A sandwich a gay pride sandwich because there s a top and a bottom to every sandwich i don t know yes you re right so as is is pretty gay yeah so i find that very patronizing burger king the more i thought into my um annoyance into pride on social media i thought well even if the intention is for attention or for profit what s it hurting me or anyone else if the grander gesture is to be that of inclusivity and it s like it s not hurting me and all it s doing is bringing more awareness so i just have to get over the posts that i think are a little calculated yeah i think social media is always going to have a disgusting twist on most things uh but i think the intention of pride and the origin of pride is beautiful beautiful and deeply important yes i agree and then i think target needs to cool their A A A A stop it with targets i love target dude i just spent mad money at target but you know chris brought us these made in a A A sweat lodge by children in africa so thank you chris for your gay pride we re super gay here and i love the gays this feels like you re trapping me this feels like you just handed me this and said we re super gay here like come on is this the moment for you i m an ally she s an ally thank you chris for reminding us of what s important i reminded you first i yeah but chris came with props wow that is true so and you should see his dick right now who s chris is what it s rainbow i m joking ryland nobody can see chris i can t see chris s dick it s because he s behind the camera good lord i m the tired mess today too chris do you have something more insightful to say about pride oh i just i just love pride month i had a very special day yesterday it was my boyfriend s first ever pride event um and he was very nervous and uh he you know he grew up around a lot of homophobic people and everyone couldn t have been sweeter and more accepting and there were many many moments where his mother showed up and it was her first pride event and there were emotional moments where she was like i brought you my son and held him and hugged him and it was just like couldn t have been a sweeter more like wonderful group of people it was a very very nice day wow yeah that s very cute thank you that backyard barbecue vibe is always cute yeah i was i was trolling on chris s stories i thought me too that s cute huh yeah we never do that i never got to look at so i flew in last night we re back together it feels so good honestly shane and i both had a great flight we had a great travel experience and he looked at me afterwards and he said we might be able to do this oh my god you guys but he had a show to be fair like he s been begging me to go to bed so that he can watch a tv like every time every time there s nothing to watch he s like i guess there s nothing on i m like oh so you re cueing me out of the room so you can continue watching nashville from like years ago the fact that shane is watching nashville for years ago and so he would i love him he downloaded episodes for the plane and i think that distracted him enough i had a glass of wine got a little doozy you know me it only takes one a little doozy yeah and then i passed out on the plane played some solitaire and we were here oh my god it s like the shortest flight too although i have a real issue with people in the airport and on planes in general the other efforts be coughing left and right like it s i know there s some crazy A A going on in airports i felt as though i was being pranked and everyone around me was in on the prank to me because i could not escape coughing it was everywhere i turned people just and it s not a good time to be coughing in public like what happened to the shame of a public cough like taught us one thing and that is we don t cough in public and we take our masks off in airports and planes and now it s everyone s coughing it s a cough for all i m like if you re gon na cough if you re coughing you should be the one wearing the mask yeah or go to the A A bathroom or like don t do it or if you really have to get some A A water bro is your throat tickly what are you doing out of the house if you have an actual A A i just didn t know coughing was such a epidemic all of this to say like last week isaac so i think i ve been around everybody with covet update didn t have copay you know i think you tested too late i think you had you of course i was technically symptomatic when i tested okay and i got two negative tests so i think i was just tired just tired and stupid that s how it goes how it works around here okay so the biggest news of the week i can i say one more thing about airports because i m about to go to one yeah you know how we have to take our shoes off no they didn t make me do that are you pre tsa pre check that no interesting well i was just gon na say like i m irritated that people take their shoes off and put them into the same A A compartment that i m gon na put my A A person so i m not grabbing my purse with somebody else s A A on the on it because like what if you stepped in poop and you put your poop shoes so let s all make a group decision that when we go through security we re gon na put our shoes face up so that the doo doo bottoms are not on the A A base of the thing where i m gon na put my sweatshirt that i have to take off and my A A purse that i m gon na put back on and just get A A increments all over my body A A no no you re right no and i take it back i did take my shoes off i blacked out yeah but i did yeah and i was gon na say it s the same way like when i pack my shoes i put the bottoms facing each other and then i put a dust bag over it exactly chris is having an aha moment chris is like i i d be pooping in them security boxes i thought it was a little box and what s more i should put my poop nothing s more disgusting than a sand than a sandal at an airport the amount of toenails i saw yesterday at least but you re like a little bit you don t even have socks on that s crazy when you take your shoes off i know at security you re gon na be walking barefoot i m in a there s no i m in a silly goofy mood there s not enough sanitizer in the world to clean the bottoms of those before you get on the plane i m also feeling like i might sneeze okay you can do that just politely it s not it s like it didn t happen but like it feels like it might happen so it s all i request at the airport is if you re coughing like i know everyone has to cough just like cough politely maybe pop into your A A sh can you just put that on the ground or something i m putting it on sleep i m trying to be here in the moment with you i know i would that s why i put on sleep okay thanks baby girl okay now into the good segway which is my puppy A A in the bed this morning oh but it was such a cute poop it s like smaller than a cigarette it s the cutest little poop okay amber heard he s this right oh my god if it was a girl i would probably have to call him amber you should have moved it was on joe s side did he pitch you off last night you should have scooched it up i like watched he s like he s so cute because i he s just so cute like i don t know how to explain it he looks unreal lizzy i was like beg cause i m on the flight and i needed a distraction so i m texting her by the minute for updates for photos of the puppy and she s like i had to put you on silent and i said i need something in my life well i was trying to text and i couldn t because the puppy really likes phones he s like putting his little paws on it like moving the screen around he like picks joe s up joe s phone up in his mouth and moves it places like he s super into phones he s very cute um i m not sure how my other dogs feel about him yet completely honest i this is the video i wanted to show you i think i sent it to you last night but we can i ll play it so the audit this is me and bubs this morning this i ll play it so that you can hear the audio because i m a manic A A mess i swear to god i thought i was gon na bring this puppy home and jelly was gon na be so happy well because you got the dog you got the puppy because when jelly saw a different puppy jelly freaked out jelly okay this is a good video so i come home with the baby and this is what it s this is what he this is me hi girlie we got you a puppy we got you a puppy that s your boy that s your mama is that your little baby mama she doesn t give a A A i started scream crying because i was like oh yeah this is a cute video and i was like oh the ending is the tagline because that is so indicative of your personality in general like you go and like you search for a dog for your other dog who has cancer and then the moment it s not showing like the most affection in the world you start scream crying and having a message i was already crying do you love him do you love it you don t love him oh no she doesn t love him and it s like sometimes she looks like she s disassociating and i m like she got that from me which one jelly jelly s disassociating bubs is tripping balls i have to spend most of my time holding bubs and telling him i love him and that it s okay well that s the problem is that puppy s so damn cute that you guys are going to give the puppy attention and then the other two dogs are going to feel as though they re left out i don t think that s a problem with us because number one there s three of us and there s three of them we have our emergency plan in case of emergency i grab bubs joe grabs jelly james is grabbing the puppy okay um but we love jelly and bubs so A A much like my world i held bubs all night the puppy slept in the pen i held bubs all night right and i will always hold bubs but he is having a lot of anxiety about this puppy it will come i mean in time and the puppy relentlessly loves them so like mama will be like one chicken and then the the puppy s just like you ran up there even like she keeps prince and i don t know the puppy s fine though she s not the puppy s fine the puppy s having the best time of his life he like played with the tennis ball this morning but he s too A A small for the tennis ball to fit in his mouth it s so cute look at this chris oh where s he going where is he going to wait for you he s too big he s so little his poops are this big oh my god he s so fast and he barks a little bit so we put bubs in the kitchen and because we put a baby gate up so that the dogs can still be places and we can still live our lives but they re not going to eat the baby right i don t think they re going to eat the baby but um so bubs is on one side of the gate and the puppy s on the other side and bubs is like the puppy s like trying to figure out how to bark back but it s like a bark is so much for his tiny body that he like shoots a little bit every time he like lets one out and uh he was so lit over his kibble last night that he was like hopping on his back feet so he s like front feet went down and his little back feet just kept going like up like this he s the cutest he slept super cute in his little pen i kept the pen right next to my bed which is on the floor so we re face to face it s basically like he s in bed with me but he s in a safe and confined environment where the dogs can t eat him and uh when he was ready to wake up he just started jumping up and down in there and then he came and just played in bed with us he wants to eat my hair out from the roots i almost brought him that brings me to my next point is i was so excited and i go lizzy does this mean i can be the god dad oh my gosh i don t even know what like that means but you know i know it s like a high honor so i thought oh my gosh do i get to be the god dad and lizzy replied to nothing no you re wrong no you re literally wrong i haven t called you multiple times the godfather no you have not yes i have to no you have not yes i have you text me so much i m never i don t know i ll find it if you don t find it because i know for a A A fact no i said you got to come meet your god son because she captured the moment that she no she got with the puppy that s not what that is to for them to give me the puppy i because i had to he came in from florida i have to give them a picture of my california license so they know who i am okay and then when i get the dog the delivery guy has to take a picture of me and my license to prove that it s me picking up the puppy this is the official photo that went to everybody at the company to say i got the dog it s so embarrassing can you look at that face like screaming um sorry the least flattering photo of me ever taken and like my like legs are bowed i look crazy and then i said oh my gosh am i the god dad or what and she said you space re i ve literally called you the god dad since the second i pulled the trigger on this dog you have been his goddamn and i was so offended i said we re breaking up right now and then she s just said sorry i have it right here no literally right here this is too far down in the game oh no this is literally like when i bought the dog i said you re his god dad oh so you re going to be scrolling for a week send it to me later and i ll put the rest okay well i know i m right about it because i literally said you have to come meet your god puppy okay or your god son or something do you want to talk about it am i really do be texting you a lot i know like noise stop like all i do is be texting you every thought guess what i m thinking now ryland okay lizzy you ll never guess tell us about the manny oh okay so uh a man first of all they kept calling it a nanny that picks the baby up and brings him to you so he s not i didn t want him in the cargo hold because i ve just it s sad to think about that yeah um so an adult picks up my puppy and then travels with him in his lap all the way here from florida and just like sends me pictures of the puppy on like every flight like having a snack in texas like the cutest A A you ll ever see and lizzy was showing her true colors lizzie can not not be lizzy which is the funniest thing to me because she s sending me screenshots of her messages with the manny who i ve never she s like texting him in all caps you can be honest with me right this is the cutest puppy you ve ever delivered with like five question marks and it s like this lizzie doesn t know this person no also i had no idea who he was i didn t get a picture of him but i kept seeing like his feet and like no offense dave did he has his toenails out no he didn t have his turns up but they were like dorky A A feet like i was looking at these feet i m like in my mind i m like his name s dave and he s got dorky feet like he s probably a A A weirdo and he like was calling me elizabeth which i get he s calling me elizabeth because that s the name he s been given but all of it i was like what a weirdo calling me elizabeth with these A A sketcher weird shoes on like velcro shoes like it was A A weird and then when i seen it yeah and then i get to the airport and i finally called him and talked to him on the phone for the first time i was like his voice is kind of sexy like that s weird it s super not the vibe i got from dave also i kept calling him dave and david and then everyone on the group chat would call him david which is not his name and um and then like when i finally see him i m like i m looking for like a dorky guy in velcro shoes and i don t see you he s so hot he s the hottest man you ve ever seen he s got like david beckham tattoos up to his throat and he s like wearing under armour blacks like mesh sleeves like just a hot A A guy like just a vibe and he d never been to lax before so he was up at her at departures instead of down at arrivals so i had to like run up the stairs i m like running i told my my friend brandy went with me because joe couldn t come because he was with the puppy the other dogs and i was like brandi turn your camera on and film me so brandy s got her camera out and she s filming me and i just jump out of the car and run away and she never sees me again and then i found him upstairs and was just shocked by the hotness of him like literally like he was like a dave beckham and did you share a moment no i m a married woman okay i just looked like that scream crying A A and he s like all right dude i got ta go and i was like thank you dave then i m holding the puppy you the

chopped down a tree with an axe no tried to fix a car with my bare hands do you remember when we did a sketch about this oh my car broke down and i was like can you help me and then we i was like in a snap your shirt s off yeah like where did your shirt go you re like i m trying to help it was a really bad sketch we should react to that live do you want him i d probably find it yeah i m pretty sure it s on my youtube channel plugging my youtube channel what is it not enough of you follow me there i don t know how to even tell you what it is was it um is it this one okay here let s see if we can place it let s scoot over so there s room for the video sharply so these are the things lizzy would drag me into frequently we d film it on one do you remember those flip cameras that yeah that s what we would film these on that s right crazy i would call them like hey i have this dumb A A idea for a sketch will you come do it with me okay put it right here and i ll do a clap we ll put it here for sinking Music what s up because this car was literally dead look at the breakage A A jump cuts for me i didn t understand coverage i was a pre law major here i come here comes just jogging and breathing rylance hit me hell what are you doing look at that my car won t start this isn t what do you think i m doing where did your shirt go we were embarrassed wow i had a six pack yeah you were hot what happened remember you used to pee in bushes all over the place what happened to me you were really hot in bushes you were so fun back then too oh back then no i m just kidding you re still fun uh no so i got home to a car battery dead and i thought i have like free i have a five year warranty free roadside assistance but i saw on my app that it was just the battery so i thought i could take care of this myself and so i jumped the car and i m thinking okay i just need to like let the battery charge for a while the car s telling me oh leave it running for minutes i was like weird but i guess that s how you recharge your batteries engine s running that doesn t work so then it s like okay i start googling how you can charge a battery so i spend on a car battery charger that doesn t work so then i m trying why didn t you just call aaa well i have roadside assistance through the car company that i have and you didn t call them either free but i thought oh if it s just the battery needs to be charged this is something i can take care of myself why did you think that because i thought if i had to send it off to the dealership i was never going to see my car again and i just wanted to get in my car and have a good time and then because it s a german car i didn t have the tool to access the stupid battery so i spent a day trying to find the tool and then i charged it for a day and then i thought maybe that s the wrong battery so i found a different battery in the car then i charged that battery for a day never worked i failed as a man and now i had called the roadside of service and it s at the dealership oh they really have to take it to the dealership to charge to change the battery they had to replace the battery full blown oh well aaa comes out and just does that for me but i don t have a cool car so i can just go suck a bunion over it this is i only know this about it s the same people sick bunions everything no yeah when people are really upset about stuff they just go and suck a bunion because it makes them forget about all their problems everybody talks like this my story was a flop and i was going to cut it but then you just saved it with your no you know we should cut us live reacting to that sketch i was just sitting there trying to focus on what you re saying like i m going to have to tell them after this we re going to have to cut that live reaction because it s just dead A A air live on your youtube channel no they re gon na be able to see the sketch right and it s like still dead air you know what i mean like it s not good and it s like quite frankly do we want people to know that s what we ve been doing because it s not live on my youtube channel it s unlisted it was one of the the worst ones for sure absolutely there were better than that absolutely there were maybe like when we were A A giving that chick in the pill i have never laughed harder than when you were giving that chicken that pill and i i have i don t know if i ve ever thanked you for giving that chicken that point we reacted to the wrong video and now we can t do another no we never will never do it again so go to my youtube channel i ll link it in the description below like comment and subscribe i post every years lizzy was house sitting a house that had chickens and one of the chickens needed a pill and you have to so you have to get the chicken s mouth open and shove the pill down its mouth to get it to swallow the pills and i have an irrational fear of chickens so there s no way in A A i was doing that i m chasing this chicken around the chicken pen and i m trying to get it and i m trying to put it in the chicken s mouth and lizzy s just like feet behind me screaming swallowing no you re screaming swallow it at the A A chicken i m dying of laughter because that s when i had a drug problem and i was on a couple xanax at the time so i was low key barred out okay so go and watch that in the description section below it s much uh it s much more rewarding i m in my press juice uniform i haven t watched it recently it s a good one dark dark days dark days um did you want to talk about your college students what s that what you said do we have college students in our demo oh damn this was a real altruistic idea i had okay cause you know it s that time where seniors in high school are graduating and going off to college and uh i remember when i graduated and was going off to college right before i went in to school and maybe you remember you don t remember anything like you don t you i remember okay you don t remember a tv show two minutes after you watch it correct so i remember i had to do an alcohol educational course online before i went to chico state but all i learned from it was that i do drink excessively and that and a new term which is browning out instead of blacking out but we used to call it rolling blackouts because we would just black out a little bit and then come to and then black out a little bit regardless nowhere in my alcohol training class did it say hey girl you drinking because you hate the skin you re in and i was thinking it s more importantly it s like a college student knows they drink excessively you know what i mean if i have five to seven drinks five to seven nights out of the week i m excessively drinking it s why i left college quite honestly right but i was thinking like if educat if alcohol education was more about identifying why you re drinking and talking about your anxiety and your emotional status and where you re where what you re trying to mask if anything or if you re like just describing different kinds of drinking like are you drinking a self medication let s talk about it as opposed to you re drinking a lot it s like no A A i m drinking a lot i hate being here i just i just i realized also like i disassociated my first year of college entirely just waiting until the day i could go home and then i didn t go back my sophomore year but i came back my junior year because i realized i should but it s like and in college you were trying to cover things too it wasn t it wasn t socially drinking no it was never socially drinking having fun it was always i hate being in my flesh suit i want the A A out of here i hate myself i don t know how to be around people i m gon na black the A A out and then after i blacked out i would get post party depression which is a chemical condition that you get when alcohol is leaving your body and that s real and then you feel more shame because you blacked out and you don t know what happened and you feel more anxiety so you drink more like i used to have this mindset like if i just keep drinking it s okay and it s like that s then you never have to face the consequences of what it s like after you ve done you re done drinking i did my majority of drinking in high school which is interesting i feel like most people do do it in college and yeah there was nothing worse than monday morning when i had to face all of the people i embarrassed myself at at a party the weekend prior not knowing what i had done or said because i was blacked out yeah and it s awful awful awful awful feeling and that s why when i got to college and that s what everyone was doing even more so on a larger scale i looked around and thought this is like what most of these people think is the peak of their life like they re dreading the day they have to graduate and face reality which is getting a real job yeah and that s honestly what made me look at myself and say i need to hightel it out of here and make what i do for a living what is the highlight right now but i think it s a good thing to realize like why even now i don t drink a lot i have like a glass of wine twice a week but even sometimes when i do that i m like am i having a glass of wine because i was like i m over today and i like want to like be buzzed out a little bit or am i just like having a good time yeah and you know not even just for high school seniors becoming college students for everyone like there there is there s not a problem with having a drinking problem but the way that i think about it is i don t have a drinking problem i have an emotional problem and drinking is my solution to that problem so if you realize that you re using alcohol as a solution to something solve the problem because by the way like since i started working on what my actual spiritual problem is i m so A A comfortable like i take it as such a compliment that you said that i can t help but to be myself because i used to A A not and it s like some of my best friends are like i never knew you hated college like i never knew you couldn t stand being there and it s like oh no i like A A hated existing and now i A A love existing i think for a lot of people though like facing their problem is is more dreadful than just continuing yeah and to drink and that s that s the lie of it because no matter what if you hate the skin you re in and you re contemplating not being in it and the easiest thing you can do is free and benefits you that s the chemical thing in your brain say like it s like a demon in your brain that s like A A you you don t deserve this but the reality of the situation is we all A A deserve it yeah we all A A deserve to be happy healthy and free no happiness is hard it s something you have to work at constantly like i m finding even for myself i like try to live in like a happy healthy state of mind all the time but i recognize that if i don t meditate frequently if i don t go and work out or get outside and walk i find myself like getting down and down in the dump so it s not easy to maintain that and i guess and you don t need a sorry do you want to contribute no i was saying it could be it could sound easier to self medicate than to work on things that free you and make you feel happy and natural euphoria yeah and to add on to that i ha i am so A A grateful for everything that i have today as a result of the work that i ve put in because like i m going through some like A A A A you know what i mean like i had to stop myself from crying the whole way here today and i start every day like dear universe i am so A A grateful that you have brought this joy into my life dear universe i m so A A grateful that you entrusted me to be jelly s caregiver and her to be my caregiver right like dear universe i m so grateful that you introduced me to people that i love so deeply who have enriched my life so much who have loved me in return and helped me on this path that we re and we re all walking home like all of those things because you know i ve mentioned a few times like i m leaving here to go uh to go somewhere today and i m going to do something very sad i m saying goodbye to somebody that i ve known my entire life who played a big part in who i am um and it is like an adoptive father figure of mine and he s always rooted for me and he s been there through all the chapters and i have to say goodbye to him and i am so A A grateful that i have the opportunity to show up and say you know something cheeky to him one last time you know what i mean but when i was using and when i was avoiding life s burdens or what people call life s burdens because quite frankly i think it s a blessing that i get to be there yeah um and it s and it s sad and it s awful but i it s i m finding gratitude in the darkest most A A up A A and when i lost my god mom kissy is when i had first started heavily using alcohol and drugs to like suppress my feelings and i didn t get to show up for her you know what i mean like i didn t get to go to hospice as many times as i wanted to and when i did go i was hungover and that s A A sad yeah and that s something that plagues me and makes me feel bad i know that she forgives me i know that she s with me always but it is like in this life so much easier to show up than to live with the regret and the shame of not doing so because you were self medicating somewhere yeah and life is A A beautiful and tragic and funny and weird and it s like we re all just here to exist so just A A do it go get a stupid A A puppy like just you know it s short we re going to find ourselves at each other s deathbed soon and i m still going to be correcting your A A not too soon baby girl i mean like years but it s going to fly it s going to go fast and i m still going to be correcting your life s life issue i ve been really working on that one or actually i m probably gon na go before you but my last words are gon na be like lives if i ve impacted your life that deeply i hope i m there for it lives is my rosebud which is a citizen kane reference for those of you out in the podium i m glad you brought the sentiment of a this is us episode to our podcast now that it s been canceled yeah so you re welcome everyone should we get to some silly things or yeah get to some silly things unless you ve got something A A sad up your sleeve i don t know if i do yeah silly moving right along chris show us your rainbow dick i don t mean to cut you off though like if we hit it if we have more sentiment let s go for it no i honestly think we we beat the sentiment over the head and now we should mourn it s okay i just didn t want to rudely cut you off i think we re done okay well into some kardashians would your audience hate and never think about it i think these topics though are hilarious if you watch the show or not because i just was beside myself the other day when i was catching up on the kardashians and kris jenner wanted to spend some time with her daughter kylie and they were trying to do normal people things yeah that they immediately admittedly had not done in two or three years like chris is like we should try to go to the grocery store and kyle s like yeah and chris goes i haven t been to the grocery store in two years and kyle is like yeah let s get gas first chris can t get gas like she doesn t know how to get gas i m like so their assistants drive their cars to the gas station fill them up and then park them in their house again and all groceries are delivered what kind of i just want to know like i m not even hating on that lifestyle i just want to know what that means what does that mean for their mental state so out of touch i also love kylie in the car wash wow it s beautiful beautiful but they re also active they re finding pleasure in life s simple things and i love that they re like going through the car wash acting as though it s disneyland on A A drugs like what is this a mom light you rolling we got to bring the kids back to this and it s like yeah welcome to everyone else s life everyone s been bringing kids to car washes to shut them A A up for a millennia also i wish someone had told them to like roll down the windows when the A A fans were going because that s what me and my dad used to do in my youth and it s like that A A hits difference as a child it s like the hysterical like ah like of the A A have you done that uh no but i call the windows all the way down when they re doing the dry and it is like if you re a little kid it s like i mean a twister it s like the most exhilarating stupid A A you could ever do but it s like the most joy you can bring in under and under after it s like they re jaded i ve seen too many fans they don t give a A A like i understand how the evolution of this happened for this family because they can t peacefully go do a lot of those things without the headache of and even if they can t it s the anxiety of watching people film you or whatever like i get it but i also just i wonder how they find happiness in that reality because they re not allowed to exist as regular people i think they have fun kris jenner has a good time oh well yeah i don t think chris jenner has a problem but i think for like kylie and kendall it must be a very lonely life yes it looks glamorous yes they have they both have jets which what a flex because kim and kylie both have kim and kylie air they re both billionaires i know and i feel like they re but it s also a big chunk of their billion dollars these jets are million or kim s is million dollars like that s a big chunk of her portfolio and then to keep it running it s like a hundred it s like the only like i know this is stupid it s like i i love everything kim kardashian and i rarely A A hate her but her on that jet was the most obnoxious thing i ve ever seen talking to all of her employees like i should get these made for it s like not relatable to anyone now i get like talk about it with kylie yeah like i mean don t talk about it with your A A assistant that s weird also like and then after that forcing everyone to listen do you have a facetime call where you then say exactly the same A A to the person on the facetime call which was pete you know what i m gon na dig this hole deeper not into it not into pete davidson not a A A stan vomited when she was like i was dtf for that bde i m just like not i i don t think i ve ever heard anyone say bde in reference to like a person specifically i get like you can not to like someone they re dating you know whose fault this is cazzy A A david larry david s daughter dated A A what s his name i already forgot his name pete davidson he thought he had a taste of the A A high life got comfortable around famous people then went out and started A A the biggest women in hollywood and how A A dare cassie do this to society she has unleashed a A A plague that can not be contained i hope to god kim marries him and has his child so that he s A A pulled off the market i think if they re happy they re happy and good for them i don t think it s whatever my pet peeve with kim is that this whole season is surrounds her booking huge jobs but she s been doing this for years and every time she acts as though i can t believe they picked me this is the craziest thing in the world but you have to understand that her early start was everyone s saying no no no like you re thick but for the past decade it has been yes yes yes and i get that she s still fighting for every milestone i love that she loves her moments i get it like celebrate the small things that are big things but these are huge things but i just am always rolling my eyes a little bit that she s like it s just the biggest thing for the tenth time yeah it s like is this and if she is really this excitable about these things still yeah because everything does become a job but she s still like she loves it she s built for this good for her yeah and i love that for her and then what i don t love is pete davidson and machine gun kelly oh my god people know you don t love them and they re sick of you talking about it i ve seen a lot of people being like can you guys stop A A on uh not a machine gun yeah machine gun like no lizzy you re wrong about that you need to listen to his album it s like girl i ve heard his album everything yeah everything i hate i dive into i A A don t like it i don t like his voice i don t like his face i don t like it okay okay okay i don t like the way he is around his friends megan fox looks like she doesn t like it either i do love me some megan fox she s a hottie battery she s a hottie potato have you seen the viral tick tock going around where A A are they getting a little tiff before the red carpet no that s a good one too but this is a dinner party and A A what s his name cougar bronson what s his actual name colson brown coulson something coulson burton baker coulson whatever okay details he s doing a A A toast and he s like loyalty loyalty loyalty lots and loyalty loyalty and megan fox is just like yeah and it s like you can just see how much she A A hates him on her face and it s like i get it megan you don t need this A A i love that she told pete like never in a million years is kim kardashian gon na A A your weird A A and then she like calls him and she goes kim the A A i like how kim put like a pr spin on that like megan was just sort of like oh cute fun we love it but it s like really megan was like kim A A what and her sisters are like as long as kim s happy like and she seems happy it s like well she might just be ecstatic that she s out of the kanye A A gloom which must have been a burden some few years oh yes but i don t know if we need to hit on any of the other kardashians i do think it s important that we note that kim that chris has a A A fake emmy gifted by which one of her daughters so kim went and purchased somebody s real emmy and gave it to chris to manifest and i

never thought i would do is it good quite honestly i think it s on season or or and here i hear i m coming in at season and it s pretty hot hot it s yeah good like damn that s pretty good i think you should check it out you can dip in at season like you did on selling sunset at season five and i think you ll be just fine i don t think any backstory matters here no nothing no you just want and what s funny about it is they just go to different locations their job is to fight with each other right and they go to different locations dripping in designer outfits to fight like they re like let s go to lake arrowhead to fight let s go to big bear to fight let s go to aspen yeah um do you want to hear something kind of cool but i don t even remember which housewife it was what so i was friends with this girl who was friends with a boy who was the son of a real housewife of beverly hills okay and he lived in his mom s pool house and his mom was always gone so we did mushrooms in her pool house no idea which one it was but that s my claim to beverly hills fame it was awful um the other thing is i really feel like i m missing out on a big part of the zeitgeist without um being able to watch the season of stranger things because i i dipped out i don t even think i made it through season one yeah and but now everywhere i go like even at the coffee shop the other day the person was like are you watching stranger things i was like oh no why would anybody say that to you because everyone s watching it it s like a conversation you also just call dutch brothers a coffee house a coffee shop okay yeah so you re talking about the guy at the drive through an attack a specific no you re not attacking him we need to uh she is the woman at the drive through at dutch bros said are you watching stranger things yeah why would that be because you start conversation it s like a conversation starter it s like if something s hot right and i m working at le pen with titian but you re a server going to someone s table i don t i still feel like if i m observing it s like my go to it s not like what shows are you guys watching what are you having for lunch that s what my hairdresser does that s a hairdresser okay but then like every episode is they have million dollar budgets and i just feel like it s not something i can just jump into season whatever i think you can did are you watching uh no i had it played out in front of me all of the episodes played out in front of me but i have always had this thing where it s like my attention can not be kept by this show me either and i just i love paul ryser and i love millie bobby brown i A A love millie bobby brown in a way that is so disturbing i should probably be on a A A watch list and i love all those little boys i think they re so A A cute i just need to know what million dollars looks like visually you saw it that s where in stranger things it s a lot of visual effects was that season one they probably weren t having million episodes no but they had a lot so like when you whenever they re in the upside down or like honestly sometimes visual effects can be as A A benign and frivol like stupid as i just don t like the fact that there s a red light flashing over there get the red light out million dollars i spent A A thousands of dollars getting a red light out of a short film that i will never release for anyone to see i i understand i don t understand i understand but i don t it s like i can t even imagine million dollars and for one episode i don t think the set s as cool as the visual effects that are done to it the sets are probably more like blue screen green screen there s probably you know actors with dots all over their faces that then get made over in cgi but i know that the evil guy in this season looks very practical effectsy okay and sometimes you can do practical effects with visual effects and that enhance it and augment it to a certain degree but like that show is clearly so much A A money from the practical to the post effects to the A A everything and it s the last season right and it s the last season so maybe i ll catch up are we stuffed are you gunned up on uh top gun maverick no but i need to see it we ve been watching top gun at the house you watched the original recently oh we watch it all the time because james s dad is the uh us air force pilot who has logged the most hours in air what yeah he s famous in the air force wow jim penland he was just at our house man yeah so and he still has the mustache and he s coveted at our house no i told you we were all tired just tired and stupid well i clicked on last night there was a video about the training that they had to go through i didn t even realize miles teller was in it until i watched this wow i mean i haven t i don t was he in the trailer yeah i guess i didn t recognize him in the trailer i haven t seen the trailer since the trailer came out he plays meg ryan and goose s son all grown up oh wow and you know spoiler alert well no i don t want it from the s i i m going to go i need to watch that before i watch the original you know i don t remember on the A A list to talk about the fabric on the A A list oh right because i m so excited i m dying i am too i wish you weren t going out of town right now so we could go i know i don t even think i could go i have three A A kids at home that are all breastfeeding have you seen it chris no but there s also a new amc theater and i m really excited to see it what do you mean uh the amc really on the closest i don t want to give away but the one that was closest to us shut down and reopened in the mall and it s all fancy at the village and stuff oh yeah let s go if i tell joe it s for working and i really want to yeah i mean that mustache i want to see if joe can rock the mustache i A A it s gross maybe but i love me a man in the military i m here for dear john and i m upset that his lady moved on from him and i get that they tried to jenna dawan this is years ago no i m talking about dear john like when amanda steve read the book whatever anyways i love a man in uniform i specifically love that mustache and i am all A A for it i wish you had already seen top gun so we can talk about i haven t seen but it s been like so many let s just move on can i just make i m gon na have a marathon and then we can do a whole thing about it years after it s after everyone s seen it including me uh do you want to talk about austin butler getting a minute standing ovation at the cannes film festival for his uh uh elvis presley as elvis yeah so here s what i thought was interesting first of all austin hi what you re into austin no i know austin no you don t yes i do you know austin austin when he was still with vanessa hudgens did a photo shoot that pira the company that i work for where i got this little j for jelly from um he was doing a photo shoot and his stylist was pulling from pira and so she asked me to put together a bunch of A A for austin butler and i like googled like oh who s his girlfriend i figure out it s vanessa huden so i gave him a v for vanessa and he loved it so much that he came into the store and he was like i was doing this photo shoot and i wore a v for my girlfriend and i loved it and i wanted to come see this and i was like austin i pulled that for you honey so we re friends we haven t talked in seven years but we are definitely friends and you might even say that i am his personal shop this is a big move like because he was on a cw show i believe yeah the sex and the city carrie diaries or whatever which was like not good and so to get plucked and have a role such as this which is going to be a huge moment yeah in movie time well here s the crazy thing he gets a minute standing ovation the pressly women are like shook floored slack jawed love him he s so cute he s a good guy he works really A A hard he lived as elvis for two years wow like did a very immersive deep dive into who he was tried his hardest cared the most and was delightful probably to be around he seems very sweet gets a minute standing ovation and when it comes to actual critics reviews of the film very mixed mostly cold i saw though that most of them were positive about his performance it was about how the director decided to the director who s very artsy fartsy buzz leemon lumen what baslerman lerman there we go bazlerman sorry all my glasses on but he s the same guy that did the sexy romeo and juliet with leonardo dicaprio and the chin actress claire danes you know what i mean you know what i m talking about well i think it s just i mean when you re making art you choose a direction and they and maybe it wasn t the most factual direction i don t know i haven t seen the film yet i heard that they don t like that it s so many flashes and it s like it s a biopic that doesn t focus on a soul event but paints the entire biography i think i don t know i m really A A excited to see it yeah i can t wait to see it and people are really upset with tom hanks s choice to do a weird dutch accent i guess but if the if tom hanks wants to do it yeah tom hanks do it he s an american treasurer let him live and that s that okay some rapid fire really fast uh this is something you put in here china is having swimming tests online yeah so i didn t realize this but i guess like china s like really big on swimming like swimming s like a pillar of their educational system like they value the A A out of it i didn t know that but during like kovid pandemic times it s like there there s another outbreak or whatever and they don t want to have a bunch of kids at school doing exams so they put out that they were gon na do swimming tests online which like is as absurd as it sounds and so people like took it and ran with it and it s some of the funniest A A i ve ever seen like obviously they decided not to do it but it s like oh wait they decided not to do it yeah because it s just so silly well there was people like jumping into their beds and showing yeah you looked different you looked at the link you put it up here then because it s so A A funny watching these people like they put their goggles and their swim caps on and they just jump into their beds and start like kicking and A A stroking and they re A A going i want to know is there a shanghai university the school said the move is to ensure that the graduation process process proceeds smoothly amid coveid how can you graduate your swimming class having swum in your bed like how can a teacher qualify you as being a good swimmer it s so funny because the thing that s like that we re all neglecting to like mention is like they re not talking about swimming technique they re talking about like the value of swimming it s like when you take a yoga class in college there s written exams on it like what s this about yoga what s that about yoga so it s like there s it s a written exam about swimming but i just love that people were like this is absurd it killed me um it s basic theory of swimming okay we only have eight minutes so do you want to get into these ones or should we get into our advice i think it s very important that we recognize that xomg pop A A made it through the first round of A A and america s got talent what s that what s that xomg pop is the six girl A A child girl band that jojo siwa and mama siwa put together and they need america s got talent when they have jojo siwa yeah that s huge exposure so jojo put them together yeah and then she got them on america s got talent yeah and they A A blew them all away simon cowell s like i don t like it i love it and then they all got like because they re so good simon is simon cowell going to live forever uh sonic hell might be an ai version of himself he s probably digitally downloaded his soul and plugged it into a A A road i think how they re cloning dogs simon s been the first to be absolutely like that s why his eyes are a little bit different than they used to be like they sag a little bit in a weird way that s not like it doesn t make sense of like age wise for him and it s because he s a clone of himself i don t think he s going to age further from here like this is it for simon and he ll be on these competition reality shows until yeah until the world explodes keep on dance until the world ends oh wow oh wow okay google voice good voice let s get into some advice though oh my god that fried the A A volume you re gon na have fun with that in post very big fan of all of you guys i love watching the steps i m very that can do it my cousin has his boyfriend and him and i have a video here and there and you know i find that i like him a lot more and it seems like he likes me more than a friend should i tell my cousin that no thank you bye bye is it your cousin s boyfriend or his friend boyfriend she likes him as more than a friend and she thinks he might like her back how close are you with your cousin that s a sticky situation but love is love baby oh well i mean if you really do envision uh being with this person for the rest of forever honestly only say something if you see this as your husband because you have to be willing to risk a rocky relationship with your cousin for the short term if not long term yeah because hopefully if this is a relationship for you that will pan out your cousin will eventually be able to come around and be like wow you two are so much better for each other than him and i ever were but you are in the short term going to lose a friend yeah and it s family so really don t A A that A A up unless you have to A A that A A up i would go more this has to be your destiny this has to be your soulmate destin lover for the rest of your A A life this is and if he s if your cousin has been with this person for a long time let it go if this is a long term relationship that you re A A with where they say i love you they live together they have things together in common like animals whatever let it go and if it s something you can t kick the feeling of after months and months i don t know how long this is growing no you can t do years because if the cousin has then been with them for years then it s a more explosive breakup well no i mean like if the cousin were to break up with the boy still give it a year you can t like that s you know what i mean unless your cousin s awful if your cousin s like really bad like if your cousin s like the kind of person who doesn t like dogs totally A A this guy but if your cousin s like a good person and you re friends with them and you value and love them don t A A that up that is so hard though yeah but like don t be thinking with your dick that shit s dumb have you heard the song no no well i also want to know like under what circumstances are the two of you alone together without your cousin and how does the boyfriend feel do you think he s leaning more towards you or more towards the cousin and if you think that you guys have this undeniable connection then i think you guys need to have a conversation the two of you to execute the boyfriend and the girl that likes him no yes they need to talk because she can t risk all of her marbles if she doesn t know he s all the way there too i wouldn t it s like uh think of it like this morgan and shane think they have morgan thinks she has a connection with shane she does not talk to you she goes to shane and says hey shane i ve got feelings for you do you too and then your ex lover and your A A sister sit you down and say we talked behind your back and we re in love does that not hurt more than your family coming to you first well obviously they ve talked because how else would they fall in love she s saying do i tell him i like him more than friend and she s using the word like him more than friend i think you have to see you have to judge by his actions and your interactions yeah and i don t think you can act on anything that s not a sure thing i could totally i think she needs confirmation in some way maybe that not be a conversation but yeah if morgan and shane did this they d be dead to me for a very long time that s not forever that s my point so you have to be willing to lose the cousin yeah and you have to know that the guy that you like is in it you need that confirmation somehow because if you A A up if this guy says no and you tell your cousin you re A A on board A A download tinder and find somebody who s available and you re not dating your family member just get off to him in your head jesus well i m just saying you re so crazy sometimes um so my friend does only fans and one of the things that he plugs on his only fans is like my cousin s boyfriend s in the shower and i m edging and we like looked it up because we re creepy but all of us are like don t be edging to our boyfriends and like even just saying it to be titillating on only fans like don t do that while you re at my mind if you are keep it to yourself well they re trying to get an audience on only fans and it s like i totally get it great marketing tactic don t do it on dates where i know you were at my A A house like i know you re not spying on my mans in the shower but like don t even like let me kind of think you might be ugh see even if it s just like for the attention grab like pick a different day this says red i m afraid that we re oh no what it says our memory card s full i hope that we re gon na have enough space oh i guess we need to leave thank you guys so much for watching and don t A A your cousin s boyfriend follow us on social media at the sip official and all of us personally as well that s really scaring me i got ta go i love you guys so much we ll see you next week goodbye and thank you if that s A A i can t afford to do another episode with you right now Music you
Music thank you Music are we rolling one take one what hey hello you guys and welcome to another episode of the Sip I m rylantis Adams of course joined by Elizabeth welcome back to our Halloween series of the podcast where this week I got to choose what we were wearing do you regret everything I regret most of it I know your husband s kind of upset yeah he didn t know you were gon na be like a A A school girl I didn t well it s a devil obviously I m clearly a sunny devil you re the devil I m the angel yeah and not strategically picked by the way it s just so it just so happened that I gained pounds and had to wear the larger costume I was like there was a small in one and a medium in the other and that s all they had and she s like perfect I m the medium and I said well then you re the devil mama and at all you know it checks out you know what I m saying I m pretty sure I think my gloves are on the wrong hands though do you feel sexier than ever um I feel sure sure yeah all I wanted to do was like take a A A picture with Lizzy we re running late because today your plane was delayed by an hour and you when you do these day trips there s just enough time for us to fit everything in and right now we re like barely have an hour to record yeah otherwise I would have shaved for you all I would have put on a little eye moment for everyone I like the natural look though it s like I feel like it s a good influence for our audience like you can be hot with no makeup on yeah but the beard is throwing like is it A A up that it doesn t throw me I still think you look hot I think for like my own like Instagram photos yeah I would like to be clean shaved and this seems normal and fair good to me I I think we need to talk about the fact that both of us are wearing fake breastplates oh why do we need to talk about that because I m concerned that people are gon na think these are my real titties I go oh Lizzy yours are so much bigger than mine and she goes no I just have my real boobs underneath yeah so these are not my titties these These are these are fake titties like rylan s titties just happened to match my skin tone Lizzie s got her whip I got a whip and a H did you scare yourself a little it s not that angel I m not used to this in your eyes they got bright for a second when you cracked the whip that s so funny yeah so we re just a couple of girls in our fake toddies I mean I m a little bit concerned that I m gon na have to wear these titties through the airport because I literally have to jump right off this couch into an Uber and what if I go through that scanner thing and they re like Miss what the A A I m like listen I think that is the best Vlog footage you could think of you know I m not gon na Vlog that you I barely block I can barely well I can t even say vlog but we have good news what um it is official I mean I don t know see the fact that you don t know makes me feel unloved well I just have to make sure like Shane will give consent outside of your presence because you are like your big presence oh so it s like I don t know if he felt like intimidated intimidated you had to like what about me is intimidating But Lizzy since we have been thinking about the alpacas has I mean you saw it on the podcast demanded which a lot of people are still rubbed the wrong way it s like giving them Vibes of when you were all messed up but here s the deal if I was a man none of you would be upset about me being demanding amen so you can suck my nuts well I don t name your alpacas Lizzy I don t have any none of my men friends demand who are your members in the way that you do who are your men friends I mean I have a few name names Chris Jared Shane right my brother I was watching a movie on the airplane on the way here Mr harrigan s phone or something like that and um Mr Harrigan gives this young boy a lesson don t ask for what you need demand what you want and I was like hell yeah yeah yeah hell to the end and I will say it I don t think it s boy girl I think it s Lizzy specific like you have a very specific personality that I love about you we re not afraid to ask for what you want but sometimes I need to remind you we don t demand we ask I demand that you name your alpaca Lizzy I picked the one with the buck teeth in the screen here s the thing previously Lizzy was choosing like the out of in the pack like the the looker of the pack I ll just say it was I yeah Ziva is the looker right but I mistook who Ziva was if we went I thought Ziva was the white one with brown spots not the brown one with white spots okay and I m saying like we re not like we re not showing but no it s fine name your ugliest alpaca Lizzy so Lizzy was demanding that we name like the breadwinner if we were like going to competition which we re not like no that is the alpaca you would take to like yeah compete that then that s the thing are there okay we re you no we re not doing that we re they re nothing you should um and you should compete and so I was not down for that but then Shane was outside when we got home from lunch when I was going to introduce the alpacas to Lizzy and Lizzy was like I love this one yeah and uh I was like oh that s like our personality alpaca because she is the one that has like awful teeth no listen to me she has these buck teeth personality one you re the most toxic alpaca mom I ve ever met and your tape is showing I know I m taking the tape off it s better than nothing so she does have like these very intense buck teeth like but she also has like a beautiful kind of smokey eye oh she s and she has like the roundest eyes I I ve gravitated towards her eyes and her Ginger appeal and she does like the very top of her Mane yeah is the same color as Lizzy s I love her and Lizzy goes this one could be Lizzy and Shane goes oh my God I kind of like that for her because and I was like I m the personality one and we haven t named her yet so I do you think that tentatively that alpaca will be Lizzy I ll always call her I just have to make sure like Shane s consensual outside of your presence as well no matter what I m calling her Lizzy I m fine with that one being Lizzy I didn t have a name for her just yet I wish that you were more than fine with it no I wish that you were static to name your all pack your personality your hideous your physically you can t hear me asking you to name your your next dog Rylan oh I ll name my ugliest dog Ryland I will do that for you I ll name my personality dog Ryland I chose the personality I ll back up I know but I wasn t saying like let s find the ugly one and name it Lizzy like that s not how it worked and she s not ugly she just has buck teeth but if she s got bug teeth and it s almost like someone broke her face at some point because it it grew in the jaggles I love her more because of that like yeah I identify with her because I feel like as a person I kind of like this tooth is was always an insecurity of mine should we call her religi relisland no I like just Lizzy I like an homage to just you you are my BFF so like I don t mind having an alpaca named Lizzy but yes we ve gotten the alpacas I don t think the actual like journey of them coming home has aired on my Vlog Channel just yet but it s a very fun process that has happened and I just want to say like inside of this process I don t know why I m this girl but I am like I ve been to Murdoch s a hundred times which is like the Walmart Farm Oh I thought it was the feed store it is the feed store but it s like the Walmart you can get everything the Walmart Feed Store yeah there s clothes for for Farmers there there s tractors there s supplies there s dogs there s everything you could ever need if you have a farm and so I ve been to Murdoch s times but not just in Murdoch s pretty much everywhere I think I m that girl that can do without a cart because I feel like me getting a cart is oh you re gon na fill it up special no it s more so like my shopping experience like I don t want I don t want to feel like settled in like I don t want to commit to the store in that sort of way I feel like if I have a cart like I can t like maneuver out quickly if I m like you feel trapped yes and so like I never like committing to a cart but I always get in the store and I m like then it s even more Awkward like because I get the cart not to be awkward right and then because I don t have the car I m so awkward because I m trying to hold like feed yeah that s insane buckets and things and then I end up getting a car anyways and I was just wondering if anybody else out there identifies with me like you go to Target and you get the handheld one we ll see by the Target it s not because someone s worried about being awkward it s because they re worried about filling that card up oh see I m the because if I grab a cart it s like all right whatever I want is going on this card uh and I feel like I m committing too much to like having my me in the store do you know what I mean I mean I guess I understand what you re saying but I don t identify Laughter like me personally the devil does not identify even if I go to like Trader Joe s it s like I can t ever commit to the cart unless I m with somebody I have to use the handheld one have you talked to a therapist about this no and that s what I really need to uncover is like why can t I commit to a cart if I m alone yeah what is that about I don t know are you okay I don t know and it never has worked in my favor ever like ever because I m never going to a store and just need what I can fit in one of those handheld things but I ve never learned my lesson would it be shocking if I was losing feeling in my arms Music sitting here feeling like a lot of oxygen is being cut off to the majority of my body right now I feel tingly and weird deep breaths um and then on like another note of my alpacas like I couldn t keep like initially like the idea in my head the fantasy of like keeping them a secret until I revealed that the Vlog was like so there it was like so me and then the second I got them I was like posting like I just I had no self control because I just love it you announced them on the podcast before it was even official I know but the podcast is like you guys deserve it you re like you re diehards for us yeah you re the podians you deserve to know things before the rest of whoever anybody any of the rest in the world the trash of the world like I feel like you guys are very die hard you re an exclusive group yes you get everything first on the podcast yeah and so then when they finally did come home I never go into like my unrestricted messages but I was just like oh I want to see like what people are saying about the alpacas and I got this really nasty message just about like YouTubers moving out of LA and how it s become trendy to like get farm animals like Jeffrey got Yaks and now we re getting alpacas and we re the most irresponsible people in the world that don t deserve to have animals that are like this and I was like what first of all you know nothing about me or my situation like yes I post my life online but I didn t like the poster that you want to be defending or something oh I think it is okay I think it is yeah yeah but I just think like it wasn t like we moved out of California because we wanted a breath of fresh air like and I think a lot of people that I know you can t take me serious it s just how good the hair is and how much it s really it s an expensive wig yeah it s a really good one I went to Cherry Creek which is the Beverly Hills of Denver stay focused on your soapbox finish your speeches beautiful and justice for all but no I think like during the pandemic like everyone you reflect on what s going on in your life and la like I love la la has a very special place in my heart but it s not the most wholesome place to have relationships that are friends even and as a couple of wholesome girls I would just like to say Colorado is where women like us belong oh yeah oh yeah but I just think like the evolution of us getting to where we got alpacas was not like this irresponsible or weird or like trendy like we weren t like oh oh you didn t get alpacas you were getting are getting farm animals so we need to do that to like be relevant or something which is what this person was insinuating and I was like they up because they were like they get this for the Instagram photos and I was like the Instagram photos yeah that s why you guys are having a baby no just kidding but that s not why they got the alpacas sorry no no I I mean it s so ridiculous I don t even know why I m responding to this yeah I was just like well it s making me think of something how dare you what I found out the name of that YouTuber that has those blind French Bulldogs what it s Joey Graceffa Graceffa Garcia Joey he has he has four blind French Bulldog puppies right now and I thought that I would use our platform to make a plea to Joey to please God give me one of those blindies okay I d love to rescue a French Bulldog all right there s one named Jack Jack that can maybe see that can maybe see yeah and there s one named Leah Michelle which I think is so A A funny I would love to take one of those puppies on like contact me please okay sound off and jokers of his comments below get me that A A puppy um did you like meeting the alpacas I loved meeting the alpacas and I liked the way that their lips felt on my hands is that weird to say their big eyes are so beautiful but I want them to just kiss me like I want like I love to just hold my little dogs and let them like because bubs will hold my face like this with a paw and icky now does the same thing like icky will kiss me and hold my face and I love it I want to be able to hold those A A alpacas but I know for a fact if I was ever left alone here you d catch me out there just like covered and spit from having tried to like hold all their little necks against their Wills I just want to cuddle and I really think they should be free arranged chickens I think you need to have all the doors open because when I was washing my hands earlier in the kitchen I just had a vision of like an alpaca could just be here curiously no and I really want them to get to know their space that is their primary space that is their safe space so I think I ll have them like exclusively there for the first week while we re really getting like used to each other because they are in a new environment but because our entire property is fenced in and alpacas don t challenge fencing they will as because like I m also like slowly having like um positive interact actions with the dogs and the alpacas like still through the fence yeah but like our other neighbors in the neighborhood their dogs co exist with the alpacas they re not like besties but they like they re brothers and so I m trying to get to that stage as well but I want to do it very slowly to make sure that it s like a nice a nice positive blending of family families but we will like they won t just like the alpacas won t just be like free range the whole property all the time but for like a few hours throughout the day yeah and then I would like to be their safe space is that is that fossils that s something we can arrange oh but I just love them so much I m grateful for the way it happened the way that they look at you with their eyes I ve never felt so seen and they re so they re they re I can t get over the way their little mouths feel they re just so soft and they have like permanent Smiles their eyes are these big beautiful eyes and what I love so much is even though they re not like the cuddliest of animals the second you like walk out through the barn they come to you yeah they like want to see you and interact with you and it s just so like they re a big stress relief like I do wish I could get all of them in one bed with me and just like sit it s a good escape from the rest of the world like I d like to sit on this couch and watch some A A with them I love them well that farm door back there that is like my dream to like that farm door the half of it open yeah where just their heads can be I want them like up in this house I mean Never Say Never Never Say Never um so I don t know did you want to talk about like the way straight boys can t seem to dress themselves and I m not a straight shamer like I m not one of those gay guys that s like to anything but gay yeah but like I have noticed that sometimes straight men struggle to find pants that fit them appropriately yeah and I I wonder what that s about like because it s more often than not it s the pants are way too tight way too and it s like we re either getting like moose knuckle situations or butt cracks and I want it s like you feel your butt crack out and like I feel a camel toe you know what I mean you got ta feel a moose knuckle if your balls are so sensitive that you like wince and Agony if I like so much as graze your testicle the wrong way you feel your A A moose knuckle and it s not cool my guy well I went through a phase where I liked skinny jeans but you never looked absurd in your skinny jeans you weren t rocking like the like Wet Seal skinny jeans on men but now I can t even imagine like I like a baggier jean that like hugs the butt a little bit but it s loose through the thighs and then tapers in at the ankle because I m not like I can t do the tick tock Trend that s the baggy baggy denim no but I don t know like we were walking today and we were just having some issues with some of the straight men out and about there was there were one too many like two tight pants like aggressively aggressively their butts like hitting you in the face and then so and but like sorry I just burped and I got a whole cauliflower moments right like yeah like Joe s butt is everything and what kind of jeans do you have that man in chinos and is that by his choice or your choice it was my choice originally and then he bought a pair online to be like sexy for me and he put them on he s like oh A A and I was like yeah you can t wear those out without me but Joe s like also got a really nice little tushy situation like Joe s like like hot like just got like a body a body yada yada yeah like he s like a built strong man arm style like shoulders for days like he has to shop at a different store because he s got such big bulky like he s got he s like a stretch like one of those stretch toys or He Man I would liken my husband to He Man for sure did you watch that heat shield or She Hulk show I watched an episode me too I watched one episode I didn t hate it I hated it really yeah wow Music um and while we were at lunch Lizzy escapes me she s like I got ta go I was like okay and she texted me from the bathroom that she s watching wedding videos on full blast blowing up the bathroom well here s the thing if I m A A in public I m definitely watching something with high volume on my phone what s worse like no because you know either way it s like if you hear the bodily sound horrifying yeah for the person it s for me it s for my disassociating it s not easy to A A in public so if I m gon na A A in public I want to like disassociate it like you A A out there yeah of course I told you to fetch I the first text was fetch me my Squatty Potty and you didn t so it was a rough A A that s the other thing that sucks about traveling all the time it s like the toilet paper s trash and I don t have my A A Squatty Potty no your

Journey yes and what do you mean by that I just mean every time I like bring up babies and you re like uh don t bring up babies I m like babies I think when we talked about the Kardashians when there was like babies I was like uh had a little baby Envy but I m not like I ve never like pressed or mad about about it okay because I was worried you were very sincere about it and I was just like oh whatever and I felt bad like yeah it s not I mean but even like I can t even say mine s harder than anyone else s because a lot of women have yeah infertility struggles like and have to do some of the same steps that even we re doing because they you know yeah so and I think like timing s everything when it s right it s right like we ve had a huge a few hiccups in the road like the first uh the first round of the egg retrieval wasn t successful like the and before we even got to trying like the donor had had her period through the birth control so like before we even got to the stage um but other than that we did meet the dog you have to stop fondling your own titties while talking about this I don t know why and we we like our egg donor had a breakthrough menstrual cycle hold on let me tuck my fake titties in I don t want to have a titty slip you re gon na have a titty slip because you re ripping your titties out Lizzy Rylan let me you do kind of seem like uh like we seem like we re at the beginning of a porn absolutely and it s a real fun porn because like I have the beard and the boobs you re like this sexy devil school teacher my shit s falling off no I m not a teacher I m a I m like a dork don t age me I m like a young dork no did you realize that we are the age that most of our teachers were yeah and I try to forget that all the time no the other day I texted my best friend uh and baby mama Haley and I was like dude it s been years since we were cakes yeah yikes yeah yikes yeah yeah yikes yikes yeah yeah you have to give up they re not gon na stay stop it they re not gon na stay I know well it doesn t matter I didn t shave so like yeah everything s ruined everything I don t get my picture because Lizzy s perioded through her Metro through her are you on birth control yeah and you re perioding yeah is that works and and you re perioding oh now she acts all all knowledgeable women s reproductive it s not like I know a A A thing about my own hoo ha but at least I know it s not called perioding Also earlier when I asked you if you re alpacas menstrual you re like I should find out well yeah I mean one of them s a child they like because the previous owner of the alpacas I think I already talked about it there s a baby do I look a little purple in the arms like honestly look at this arm it looks a little purple right I need to get my grandma s oxygen reader over here for you like honestly I feel a little blue you re lucky because your skin tone really matches the the totties yeah yeah which I it s disturbing them I m not as blessed as you win that Arena I also have these crazy farm farm Tans James also has a set of totties that comes with a face and it is perhaps the most disturbing thing you ll ever see I saw on Amazon you can get full bodies yeah we so we have arms and we have face and we have I don t know if we have legs but I ll show you the face and you can put the asset up if you want to but you re gon na have to blur it um tell me more Mommy oh where is it you want to milk me after this no I don t think I could milk you honey why you don t produce milk you don t know that I do you don t whoa yeah terrifying huh that is icky s trying to get him out of it he s like this is wrong this is wrong who is that that s James wow yeah it s disturbing as A A here I ll bleep I ll blur the totties so the audience can see I don t know if it will be in Focus Elizabeth I m sure it is thank you for trying you re welcome so we met our donor what is that legal what do you mean is it legal to meet your donor yeah why did you meet her we wanted to get a sense of what our child was going to be like really yeah where did you meet her where did she live we ve met no over Zoom okay um I mean we ve met our circuit over Zoom as well you met your surrogate yeah over Zoom why do I think people don t meet these people I mean a lot of so like the the egg donor she s done this one other time and she said the previous family asked no questions didn t want to know anything wow but Shane and I really feel as though like one day our child will be asking questions like we re not uh we re not thinking like they re going to think forever they came from Shane and I together you know like they re gon na find out how this works and they re gon na think oh I do have a mom somewhere I thought we were gon na tell them I m their mother in my mind we were gon na tell them I m there I ask you to get you pregnant every day this is such a slap in the face that you now wan na you wan na disguise yourself as their mother when you won t bear them it s the way you re really happy did get really serious about my will today and asked who was going to take my children in case of an emergency and I was like why are you gunning for them no I m happy to be the third place taker the third place okay all right the third installment Okay the third is that for any of your other baby mamas Lily s mine if anything happens to Haley and Aaron and she s a really good one she s a price point she s walking she s A A walking and she s like full blown communicating does she say Ryland when she walks no thank God Lily never say Rylan Ryland no Rye Rye stop this is right I know she s watching you know really Lily Mama Lily mama say Lily may she responds to Lily may Lily may say right right right this is so not how I want her to know you actually it s pretty safe it s pretty it s like this is exactly how you should be known sometimes I feel like when you re in a wig and a dress you become like a yeah she s a different woman oh my God and we love her yeah almost you don t you don t want to be around me in a wig quite honestly uh no that s not true you re very fun okay thank you it s like a liberated you it s like me after a couple glasses of wine it s like you after you smell wine you re so funny oh oh what do you want to do you me stop it I m a married woman Lizzie did almost like pull a finger in my butt when she was doing my corset I did not yes you did I did not you did you were bending over like a little A A and you were trying pulling your skirt up and I said you put that down and you went I pulled my dick forward so it wasn t weird it s all weird all of this is weird Laughter Joe was like I didn t know you guys were doing A A I was like this was ryland s idea I made fish heads I said Joe don t A A worry about it our audience is women and gay guys if you re straight in the comment section let me know I m actually curious if there s some of you and are you gunning for Lizzy let s know if there s a threat to Joe no no did we already talk about how upset you were when you discovered there were no like yeah nobody hitting on you in your DMs no nobody s sitting on me in the DMS I m fine ever not everyone needs to be hit on in their DMS some people need other things I don t think I m getting hit on in my DMs either so you said someone said hey cutie on Snapchat right that s a DM okay whatever whatever Mama should we transition into some advice though all right so today s advice though is starting with two am I the A A submissions awesome so it s a little am I the A A themed they re a little bit longer so stay with us I think it will be worth it hi Rylan and Lizzy I hope you are well and Chris and Shane too if they re there I m not sure if I attract crappy people in my life or if I m the problem and I m hoping you can help me I don t have any I don t have very many friends and I never have long story short none of my friendships last people either betray me or hurt me and I m someone who can only take so much before I have to separate myself from the relationship fast forward to present day I m friends with someone who I started a book podcast with during quarantine she has been pretty shitty to me throughout that time not allowing me to post on our shared Instagram telling me uh what to wear for pictures to the point that she s criticizing my outfits and calling them cheap fast fashion she gets mad if I don t respond to her ASAP and picks apart all the little things I do I put up with a lot of it because the podcast was her idea so I let her be in charge also we have fun together and we ve grown the podcast a lot so much so the Publishers send us books to review for free but this past week I got sick with kovid I didn t respond to her texts for a couple of days because I was sleeping and she has since blown up at me when I told told her I might not be able to record the podcast this week because of how sick I am she showed no concern for my well being and instead was Furious that I didn t tell her sooner she threw such a temper tantrum over text that now I don t even want to do the podcast with her like ever this just kind of feels like the last straw how do you know when it s time to cut a toxic relationship off versus when uh you should keep fighting for it it I don t want to become known as someone who just cuts people off as soon as things get ugly but I also don t want to waste my time and energy on a shitty person am I the problem do I just attract shitty people or do I need to stick things out longer there s more to this particular story about why I think it s time to cut ties but any advice you can give would be appreciated thanks for taking your time you guys make me laugh and I love the podcast on both your Vlog channel so much I mean I think you ve given us enough evidence as is to justify cutting ties I would uh evaluate sooner when you re meeting people I think as we get older it s harder to find friends that will treat you right especially if you ve come to a place where you respect yourself enough to say goodbye to a relationship even if it s toxic so yeah good on you for knowing what s healthy and not healthy for you um but I deal with Lizzy every day so like I get weird I have to go um no I mean I I agree with that and I think a big part of if you ve noticed a pattern of like shitty people coming into your life that you have to get rid of then I wouldn t say that you are the problem but I would say that there is something that you need to tweak in the way that you see and respect yourself so that you stop attracting people who come in and bombard you and take advantage of you yeah I agree and if you really look up front people will tell you who they are they ll give you signs they ll show it through their behavior and I think you can only learn that as you get older because we all want to especially because it s so hard to make friends we want to think the best in people yeah we want to make friends and we want to have a good time and I think a toxic person can really mask themselves with a lot of fun yeah throughout like weaving in things that make you go and they did that but I ll give them another chance because I do this all the A A time like I ll notice something in a person that I m like that kind of makes my stomach feel funny but maybe it s just just me and it s like that s not me giving myself enough credit it s like no Lizzy your feelings are valid and if you don t want to be around someone you don t have to be around that person and you also don t have to give them space to be awful to you like this happened this happened to me like two weeks ago I was like yeah I remember I was texting you we can t go into details about it specifically but like I ve been around this person where it s like every time I m done being around them I don t feel good like I actually feel bad I feel like I ve been picked on and I don t like it and I think the first step especially when you re in deeper with someone such as you are in a working relationship with this person who now you re having to do this with uh like if if this was just your friend it would be a lot more simple I do always think you should choose your headspace while also being honest with yourself because it s like if this is a pattern and you are the common denominator you do have to look yourself in the mirror but if we re putting that aside it s like you really do have to choose yourself yeah and this sucks if this means that your podcast that has now become successful has to go to the waistline my advice would be to first try to have a very civilized conversation face to face with her because text messages you can t always tell the tone things can go and Beyond it being about being able to tell the tone you take back your power and you show yourself that it s okay to have your feelings and to voice your feelings and to make yourself a priority when you don t do the chicken thing of texting it you have to do it for yourself to gain the strength and the momentum to do it like personally and I think like you were saying there could be some misunderstandings is there something wrong with your flight no I just wanted to check okay there could be some like misunderstandings on both ends that Harbor resentment and if you don t talk about things that bother you yeah it could like if you really pissed me off I never told you you pissed me off my resentment could come out in different forms for things that are completely are relevant to the situation in which I m mad so maybe throughout this business with both of you like you not being able to post on the Instagram are you not having access to maybe the analytics or something and that s something you want maybe there s all of these things that you guys need to just lay down communicate a table and if you want to continue this podcast you re gon na have to start anew you re gon na have to start fresh and you re going to have to create boundaries and say like this is exactly what I want and this is exactly what I want and we need to tell each other when we piss each other off like even sorry I m I m going along just really quickly your nipple is hanging out now stop it I m sorry I had to tell you and since we re just because we re already distracted it s not waistline it s Wayside okay okay and I feel like there something you said once like did kind of rub me the wrong way it was a nothing and I was like I do have to tell you this because I don t want to hold a result no I don t love him like once he says once as if it s not daily but I think it s very important I agree with you I think it s very very important to communicate specifically because you re in a collaborative position so even for yourself before you walk from this relationship give the relationship and yourself the opportunity to voice your concerns and it doesn t have to be confrontation it can be a dialogue no yeah I know I m saying you want the confrontation because I would say someone hold my hair but um even if it s unrelated to the podcast I think if you re going to have a business with somebody you have it s a relationship such as a love reli like a love relationship you have to have an open communication you have to let each other know when you hurt each other s feelings and you have to grow together instead of a part so you need to work at it like you would your boyfriend or your girlfriend yeah and also I have to say like it s shocking to me how well this podcast has worked for us because generally I would not work with my friends right yeah no I agree and I think it s because like if I do something a little weird I tell you or oh I think it was even I know exactly the scenario I was like anxious about telling you about but then I did because I was like you re coming to film a podcast this weekend and if I don t tell you yeah I m going to actually like wait what was it resentful it was something with uh my brother who like helps you with fine oh yeah it was yeah and it was totally a misunderstanding and it wasn t necessarily your fault at all but because I felt I was like well I recommended Lizzy and yeah yeah so I was like my stomach was turning and I was like if I don t tell her I m gon na be like resentful and take like Digs at her so I think a lot of the digs coming your way yeah could be resentments that are not related but I think you need to have a sit down conversation Start Anew and be honest with each other if you ever want to have a shot at this podcast if that doesn t work you have to cut ties yeah and I think not even about preserving the relationship but about retraining your brain in the way that you handle all of your relationships starts with trying something different and instead of just cutting ties and running it s speaking unconfrontationally unemotionally about what you want and need in a relationship without it being a problem to want to need things yeah yeah and like quite frankly like I don t think working with your friends works yeah it s very special circumstances yeah all right let s get to the next because we um through a lot so I work in a pretty small office and I have one co worker that I and almost everyone else in the office just can t stand she s at least years older than me and I find her to be incredibly immature and annoying if I m being honest she recently had a family member pass away and for the last few weeks everyone in the office is going over the top to be overly nice to her and make excuses for her when her work isn t up to par since I would not consider her to be my friend I have not been doing this because I think it would be disingenuous and I don t want to pretend to be someone s friend just because they re going through a hard time I m not mean or anything I m a cordial towards her I just don t go out of my way to comfort her or ask her how she s doing constantly I have also had family members pass while working here my partner was actually uh Jesus my trigger warning trigger warning my partner was actually contemplating uh suicide about a year ago while I was working there as well which was one of the hardest things I ve gone through but I still showed up every day did my work and didn t try to talk about it in the office constantly am I the A A A A for not pretending to be her friend of course I care that she lost someone close to her and I feel for her but we all go through hard times I m interested to hear your feedback I love you guys Lizzie you re on oh my God I m an icon and I m obsessed with every outfit you wear please start telling us where you buy your clothes honestly as well yeah mostly it s the Gap in Abercrombie but um I don t think she s an A A I don t think you re the A A either I do think it would be disingenuous for you to start a relationship because of a traumatic event in someone else s life if it happened organically or you guys had a run in I don t think it would be weird for you to say like I m so sorry or if it s on uh if if you re included in a group email with all of your co workers that like your boss started I don t think it would be awful of you to just weigh in and be like I m so sorry I hope you re doing or like wish your condolences yeah but I do think going out of your way and trying to forge a fake relationship because something awful happened to somebody isn t something that you have to do in a workplace I also don t think it s great for the person who s going through the loss no because then they have to it s almost demanding of them as well yeah in a weird way yeah and it s something that drives me crazy is like the amount of times people ask like are you okay like no I m not like and no and you know I m not and is it fun to explain why you re not okay like everyone knows so yeah I didn t even think about it in that regard I think quite frankly like if a person is coming to work it s allowed to you re allowed to be very Grace gracious to them someone going through like a major loss or like a life crisis like be gracious be patient especially with her work not being up to par even if that s something you re having to pick up I think being understanding of that that s the kindest thing you can do yes but I don t think because I personally like I ve been through some things and it s like like I went to work the day like both days I lost somebody I went to work and I would have not been able to like I welcomed the distraction because otherwise it s like I m sitting in a very quiet space and my body s still in shock and I m not like for me I m talking for me I m not ready to process something that quickly and like I need a minute you know what I mean you haven t had time to process yourself the last thing you want to do is talk to somebody you ve never been close to work yeah like maybe if you have a bestie at work yeah like you if you re and you re and you need to talk about it with your bestie that s one thing but if if like Joe Blow at work is like hey I m so sorry I heard about your massive loss do you want to talk about it s like not with you Joe Blow no we ve never been friends yeah I do think the kindest thing you could do is if you re on her team and her not being as efficient at work means that you could help pick up a little bit of it would be the nicest gesture you could possibly do because it shows like yes we re not the best of friends but I am I am not above like helping you out in this trying time yeah and you don t have to do it forever it s just no like and yeah you re not an A A not at all and I m sorry to hear about what you were going through too like that s that s really hard it s a lot to go through I am in high school and I m gay but my mom wants to pay for my college I m really scared that when I come out to her after I have left she s going to hold that over my head but she won t let uh but she won t let me pay for it I also can t come out to her now because of safety I know that when I tell her it isn t going to be good because she is very Christian and Southern which is not a good combo for the gays do you think I should come out before college and not let her pay or wait until I graduate and then come out and still not let her pay or just let her pay any thoughts uh you have would be appreciated hmm I mean at the end of the day she s your mother and I feel like if she doesn t come around that is a huge loss for her I wouldn t hold on to something you know is who you innately are I think the Best Buy hold on you mean like stay closeted yes okay because so you re saying you would not stay closeted I would personally not stay closeted I came out at a little older of an age because it took me a little bit longer to like come around to like assuring myself that that s what in fact it was I mean I remember you wanted to come out when you had a boyfriend yes and that was a big I kept being like as soon as I have a boyfriend is when I ll tell my family because it s easy for me to just be like Oh I m in a relationship and this is who it s with yeah I thought in my mind I was like that s so much easier for me to like digest and have them digest I mean and it s a little bit like just choosing to like tell your parents you re sexually active which I also like for me like I don t have that relationship with my parents like I m not gon na come home and be like guys I m A A you know what I mean it s weird but I do feel that there was this uh this whole thing that took over my life until it happened where I felt like I was lying to everyone around me I felt like I couldn t unlock my potential I felt like my personality is who I am and I felt like I was hiding and like pushing down who I was and I truly do feel like when I accepted myself for who I was when I became comfortable in my skin and I didn t care what other people thought about it is when I became successful because I allowed myself to be me and live authentically as who I am and I know it s not that easy for everyone like I think a part of me moved to Los Angeles because I I like I wanted to do everything I wanted to do but another Allure there was like I didn t think anyone was going to get judged for anything because everyone was a Melting Pot of moving from everywhere to in pursuit of their dreams yeah so I think that was a buffer that did help me like I I don t know if I was in Colorado when I came to full terms with it if it would be so easy for me to do so but I do think in doing so you will find what your future will hold faster yeah I also think that when you decide to diminish who you are or to to hide who you are for money which would and money is your tuition in the scenario you start training yourself in a really toxic pattern and I understand that school is very expensive but I I think that more than anything you you can not put a price tag on your emotional well being and what Rylan said about when he finally became himself he became successful when he finally came out to his family he he and no longer had the burden of the anxiety of the quote unquote lie that you felt like you were living with you blossomed professionally and personally yeah and the same I think is true for myself so not in a gay way but in a in a different way in in my alcoholic way I hated myself so deeply that it felt like I was living a lie because I didn t want to be here right and I never wanted to be here and the second I was able to come to terms with that and accept myself and love myself was I able to thrive personally and professionally as well right so um and you know for like a long time you you make it seem like oh no I m okay with living this way because I can t afford to live another way but that s that s a lie and when you re doing that you re just keeping yourself from actually living and I think the faster you tell your mom the faster your relationship will become repaired yeah I feel like the sooner the better because like you re going to feel even more in myself like my mom knew I was gay but it was more so for me I felt the lie and the LIE grew within me not her so it s like and it wasn t necessarily A Lie it was just like it was the time it took me to come to terms yeah but that s how it felt internally so I think that s one thing the other thing is really evaluate where you want to take your life when I was in high school I didn t understand the implications of the debt I was getting into or signing up for ask yourself what you want to do when you grow up and the best steps to get there and maybe if you re worried about financials maybe start and do your the general things the general credits you have to do anyways at a community college that doesn t cost you everything all at once yeah like I wouldn t make money your end all be all because you re going to find a way and also uh but I do think that it s really important that we acknowledge the fact that uh it doesn t feel like a safe space for them to come out right now of course yeah and I think that that is a that is a valid thing that you really need to check in on like what what is uh what is a safe space for you to come out in and if safety is a concern a backup plan or until you re old enough to leave the house and be on your own don t yeah don t put yourself in danger but also really really focus on the specificity of that word safe what is not safe about it are you in physical danger are you an emotional danger what is unsafe about it are you or are you just terrified of the response that you re gon na get and and really weigh out what the reality is of that fear is this an anxiety bread of your own insecurity or is it an anxiety bread of you know growing up in a in a physically and emotionally abusive environment and I agree with you I was going on the information we had his concern is his mom is religious yeah so there s that but I felt like your um punishment may it be would be financially based on what we got but I agree with what you said oh I m I m like not even just for this specific inquiry but for anybody listening who s right grappling with the same issue um know what that is because like also I didn t think it was safe for me to tell people I had relapsed before I got sober this last time and it s like when I hold on to that secret and I don t tell people because I m like oh I m gon na lose my job or I m going to lose this relationship or I m going to lose this person s trust if I tell them that I was on drugs or like had relapsed or whatever that s not true that s keeping myself in a sick in a sick cyclical potential possibilities there s the potential of consequence but the the grander consequences is perpetuating a live emission and allowing and like and every time I did tell somebody oh I had relapsed it actually built trust because I was being honest and yes there s a very big A A difference between coming out as gay in in an in an unsafe space and telling someone that you relapsed on drugs but I m talking about serious yes yeah no I don t think that s invalid at all you re speaking to your experiences um but good luck to you and we wish you the best yeah good luck life is like you ve got your whole life ahead of you that s exciting and the sooner you can live it authentically I mean better sorry guys I m losing a lot of oxygen peaking in high school I titled it that dude honestly like I wish you could feel what my arms are like right now does my scar look like it s turning purple a little I really am telling you I need to get out of your situation honestly scared a little bit these boob plates are really like tight like oh my gosh yeah oh where d my phone go oh we have one more okay what is it peaking in high school yeah hello guys hello hello you talk a lot about self love but I find that so hard all I think about is what I looked like four years ago in high school I was athletic and I didn t even worry about what I looked like I am married now and I look in the mirror and I hate my body my husband and family say I look uh good and the same I did back then but I don t see it I used to always have to wear makeup and I stopped that and I felt good but I m back to that again I just don t feel comfortable being myself I worry about going to the gym eating what I wear just everything what is something you do to love yourself I think we talk about it a lot on this podcast which is like enacting habits that produce a healthier state of mind I understand falling into Ira especially I m guessing it s not that physically drastic if everyone around you is saying I don t think you look that different or you ve gained weight but like I understand to a degree like I feel like recently as it s gotten cooler here like I ve never been like oh my gosh I m gaining weight and I know I m not like plus sized whatsoever but I do feel like I ve been eating more than ever and like the bottom layer of my stomach has like gained a little bit of pudge and I do keep being like oh what are you doing what are you doing why are you doing this and I ve never like ever thought about that sort of thing ever like it s not a struggle that I have had um but I think it is just taking steps in your life that make you feel better even if they re challenging if it s going to the gym even if you don t feel great because eventually it will make you feel better not only releasing endorphins but over time like physical results as well I also think that um something that I m trying is I m trying to remove my self love and worth from my physical appearance so it s like I what what uh what does happiness feel like to me like what makes me happy those A A fried pickles make me mad happy dude I m gon na eat the fried pickles like that hands down I m gon na die one day and I don t want to have died missing one A A fried pickle and that has been kind of my mind stay in like how I ve been just eating and trying things and living and loving as well but it can get you to a place where even if it s not physical I think like over time eating like eating well it does change right and those pickles are also gluten free like it s like it s I m not talking about doing heroin because it makes you happy and you re gon na die one day and you re going to want to do in heroin but I am saying value yourself differently your value is not determined by your weight on the scale your value is determined by your happiness and your kindness towards your fellow man and that s it and I think asking yourself what the deeper issue is like why are you in a place that you re constantly worrying about this anyways like the day to day routine that you have right now unfulfilling do you want to make a change where you re doing something that may like you you were saying earlier like if something makes you happy go after what makes you happy go after the feeling that makes you happy Chase happy and go after it yeah if you re not feeling fulfilled by your life it you got it like honestly it can not be about what you look like we re born with our bodies expiring your body is going to change your face is not going to look the same that it looked day after day after day you have to start to love yourself for something more meaningful Danielle robay came on our podcast one time and she was talking about her body image issues and she said that every time she starts to have like negative self talk she ll think about doing something that s good for her fellow man and when she puts herself into a service position she s no longer thinking about herself in a physical but she s thinking about making the world a better place and I think that s like a really beautiful thing you can do and I m not talking about like you know going and building houses in a foreign country I m talking about something as simple as saying something kind to somebody else reaching out to someone you know and saying hey I really love this about you and or like yo I was just thinking about this one time you exuded strength and I wanted to point that out like why do you think you re passionate about finding things that light a fire under your ass because then you re more involved in that and how excited you are about whatever it is you re working on or like building up to that you have less time to like consume how you feel about how you look and I also feel like we re such A A for talking about that like right now while we look this hot wow perfect titties do we keep going no you ve got an airplane I ve got to go you ve got an airplane to count you ve got to go I did start thinking next episode is our th episode you got to get this boob plate off I really do have you got to change before this Uber comes I am I am fearful of how uh you might be treated in the airport looking that sick yeah I mean I got stopped in the TSA on the way here because my sweater was tucked into my pants and it s like what are these totties gon na do um all right you guys well good night no uh good night and good luck uh thank you for watching our podcast we so appreciate it uh Happy Halloween I

in fact I did you were able to execute effortlessly okay so how s your a m morning routine going oh we are done with that that is not who I am that is not who anyone is meant to be it s really not it s not for anyone really no and these A A that act like they do it and they act like they re so productive and doing all these things they re like yeah well you re asleep at pm when the rest of us are having fun well it on by day three I was on the couch with icky and we just knocked out hard like you could have A A robbed the house A A scalped me taking my A A feet and all my organs and I wouldn t have known it and I woke up and I texted Joe and I was like hey man come film me and the dog sleeping out here for the Vlog and he s like I ve been gone forever I left right by your dead body and like the dogs barked we re jumping on you like and I was just like well A A maybe this ain t for me and then by day three I forgot to set my alarm but my body woke up naturally no my dog needed to A A at which was already passed to the point of time that I was gon na go to the gym but I will say I m a little bit on the fence because it is nice to get the gym out of the way are those stupid classes packed is a a m class pass yeah you guys need help I think they have jobs they probably have jobs and families and this is the time they could go you know what I mean I but I had no reason to be there you know like I know business being there with them like I have nowhere to be I can tell by your text messages like I could tell she was going to bed earlier because I d text her at like P M to no response but then I could tell as this was wearing off she would start texting me like responding to me in the morning but it d be like a m and I was like this is a lot later than a m A A I do think that I am going to stick to a m oh but I m gon na alter it so like the thing is also like I m waking up at am but I m still not able to do the full routine because it s not just waking up at am it s like journaling making a to do list like all of these things that are all for your mental Wellness so that you can clear your head space so that you can be more focused on your work and my I realized like and this will be in my Vlog but my Mantra from Michael Jordan is my goals are non negotiable wow and that s and I mean that with every fiber of my being my goals are non negotiable and is that from his documentary um I think that s just his mindset he s a real crazy competitive A A he s like I was going for the championship my goals are non negotiable so you know I got it and it s like I want that well I hope you bring that energy to our Christmas movie that s been hard passed on again same guy it went from a soft pass to a hard pass but he had good ideas and he loves us you heard the ideas you said those were good you were speechless you were shook by them or maybe you were whatever I have hope that I ll be a Jennifer Coolidge and I ll peek in my late s or we re not giving up we have that whole strategy I know we have a strategy but I m just saying even if it doesn t happen to me until yeah it s like I ll be fine next week if I m at the Golden Globes crying at we re good you know I don t know but here s well I just got ta say maybe a Daytime Emmy but whatever what I m really trying to say is let s set a goal our goal is next week let s put our package together and hit your agents hard in the face with it yeah my agents that kind of exist yeah no we ll go to where their kids are in daycare and we ll make sure that they hear our A A cracks and you better believe we know where your children go to daycare I go to pick up and I m like oh my God you walk here too they re your agents we re just going to call them I mean are they we are going to call them yes are non negotiable time between I don t even know which agent is my agent yes you do they follow you on Instagram you told me kind of whatever I m married oh that s right this A A got married on the slide I can not believe I told Lizzy without uh any hesitation but it s pretty impressive that you didn t slip anywhere I told one person who who was it no technically I told three people but it was the ones that I knew wouldn t say anything and would care I was pretty loosey goosey with it I was like telling everyone I was married and had a husband and who nobody told anyone to my knowledge that got out on the internet at least oh yeah no I wouldn t tell anyone like that I told Joe Joe told James when I told Haley yeah so Haley knew fine yeah fine it was pretty exciting I was just sitting in my massage chair editing editing my Vlog on maybe a Sunday night I don t know some some kind of night it was a night it was maybe Saturday night no we got married on a I don t know a weekday a weekday that s why I started working um and I was like I just got hit with these pics I was like and then I started crying and I was like and it was crazy Chrissy oh I could cry again well the more that I think about the wedding industry the more I m so angry for everyone yeah because there is this unrealistic pressure I feel to put on a big ceremony that feels like has to cost a lot of money yeah and then when you actually go and execute and get your marriage license they re like okay that s thirty dollars and this is five minutes of your life and it s like what s everybody making such a big hoop up about well I think for me the wedding is about celebrating the commitment and the the beginning of the next chapter right and I think that I really like that I like the idea of celebrating that okay but I don t think that we need all of these elements that have become quote unquote tradition which it s like I don t think the tradition is that you waste fifty thousand dollars at the low end right there s so many other things if I was gon na spend Grand I could choose a lot different things honestly but that s you know that s and that s part of it like you can throw a regular part be probably for like five thousand dollars and it s like a Swanky ass party but the second you tell someone it s a wedding the prices go up and everything s a lot more expensive and we had explored doing a lot of different things for the actual ceremony and well before this I I don t know like the wedding in my head like having the celebration for people didn t feel authentic to me or Shane because I felt like our relationship has always been the two of us because most relationships are like yes there s people that have been around the entire time we ve been together but I still felt like the shift and the energy Vibe and the celebration was as potent had as it would have been had we had a big ceremony maybe more so because I would have been so anxious and the more that I m thinking about this part of your celebration do you have to pick something up it s my dog s vet okay I m so sorry if it wasn t hello fantastic thank you so much for letting me know and he s got his bed awesome thank you yeah that jacket also smells like his brother so if you wanted I don t care if it gets dirty if you wan na if he wants if it helps him just to sniff it but no pressure you re psychotic I m not psychotic You re Gon na Love My Dog crazy I know I felt so bad for podcasting and you re like does he have his bed does he have the jacket that smells like his brother can we get him to smell the jacket that smells just like his brother and I m like listening he s never had a surgery before I was gon na tell you too like I was gon na be like with you guys if I get a call from the vet I have to take it but okay yes icky well we ll get into it we ll get into that back to your marriage thing and I was I was holding it for a long time and you re looking and I m like okay answer your phone I wouldn t have interrupted but it s like he s my baby I know I get a I ve had two animals neutered or spayed in the last month so I m just triggered by it now you know what I mean right because like all surgeries I m just like no it s awful it is yeah like and I know it s routine but no matter what they re like do you want us to try and revive him if something should happen like yes I do A A no at the vet this morning I literally said I was like if you have to make a human sacrifice I want you to go that far and if you need me to provide the human I m going to be doing the podcast with someone who deserves it and I will be there in about minutes with his A A skank ass bound and gag okay back to my wedding back to your wedding back to my wedding I for myself just felt like the celebration was more intimate and more of something I could uh actually be inside of the moment with the two of us because I wasn t thinking about making sure everyone else was good yeah like we went and it felt so fun because nobody knew like we didn t even tell your mom and talking about her we texted everyone after everything was done with the photos being like we re married and I did feel a little bit bad like oh is it mean of me to not include like the closest people in our lives and like of course Shane s family is in California but the same I think A A that and that s what I ultimately decided and so then we ve been planning like a party and the more I even think about that I m like maybe Shane and I should just go to Mexico and have our vows on the beach and just like ex like celebrate together there s something about having to merge all these people I just hate it I hate it I hate I don t know what s wrong making you unhappy don t do it I don t know the wire that s missing in my brain that s like I needed elaborate celebration for my wedding for me as a person who like loves you and like wants to celebrate you guys and all of that it it s about you guys you know what I mean right so if you are hap if that makes you not happy why the A A would any of us want to force that you know what I mean yeah I mean I d rather at this point do just like a dinner where we like rent a room in a restaurant which I think everyone just like and it can be more like cocktail hour where there s food coming in and out and people can drink what they want eat what they want and we can all just like have a low pressure evening together yeah that s fun Music we definitely wanted to get married before we got the kid thing like moving in full effect and the craziest thing we ve been going on this like egg donor Journey for a very long time and like we finally had gotten the schedule for like when the donor was gon na come to La for the pros the retrieval to happen and I thought it was happening on Friday the th and I got an email the day that like we were posting the wedding video being like she s going in today and I was like the bags we results of the potent tea of the a I don t know the right uh terminology we haven t got like the viability I mean I don t think they would have gotten them out had they not had there not been enough you know they wouldn t have gone into surgery if they wouldn t have gone into the roost who had the chicken not laid the eggs yes and I think they know like too much nowadays about like what they re doing but we they still have to like go in and see like when we went in to have our consultation with the fertility clinic it was like us sitting down with the doctor and him explaining in Spanish not really but like I couldn t understand right oh like he s just like he s explaining it in another language that you don t understand because it s also medical and then if it s like in stupid terms it was basically like if we get of eggs that s great and of those are probably like ready to get cooking and of those like we ll probably get six that we can the three are boys and three are girls and I m just like okay hope it works all right whatever just call me when this A A is pregnant I have a new pregnancy fear unlocked what apparently noses expand oh noses are ever growing no this is different oh like a pregnancy nose hits different oh like for the pregnant woman yeah wow yeah I would oh my gosh I can t wait until you re pregnant on the podcast and I have a huge nose and we can talk about like because I can t be pregnant I can t wait to like I m gon na be sitting here like I wish we can t breathe because I feel like every pregnant woman s just like I m like particularly sensitive so I m like A A you drinking I wish we could be pregnant at the same time I know I kind of feel like your baby s gon na be born and then I m gon na be pregnant no stop it I think that s probably the case though right not

to like have someone else do it so that he Associates them with horrible things instead of me and he s so sweet this morning he was just like I could cry right now actually talking about it he s like him but he s like I love you I love you and you re like you don t even know what s about to happen this recovery is going to be hell and then on my way out bubs is like you re taking him and not me you guys are gon na go for a walk without me and it s like it s not a walk Bobo they re taking his balls bro and it s like I took bumps the last okay so last week also I recently scratched Nikki s A A cornea which is why I ve started you scratched it was me it was you it was me you re the problem it s me hi nice um so I scratched Sticky s cornea with my eye while trying to clean his A A skin fold so that he didn t get a yeast infection on his face A A me right now I feel less bad about accidentally kicking my cat oh so you ll talk about that here well no no now you re saving content well no now that I know that we re not all perfect parents and accidents happen yeah we re admitting to scratching your dog s eye it wasn t like I was like scratch you A A dropped me completely across the kitchen into a cabinet is so aggressive when it comes to food he s acting as though he s still a street cat and he s never gon na find another meal again so he s harvesting food so I try to feed Cheeto first and I m going to feed Cheeto and Louie s being a nightmare down there so I go to like gently like move my foot to move so he s intentionally kicking the cat no I was like I got ta move my foot to make contact with his body and just sort of ease him off in a different direction my hands my hands are like this but the same time I go like this to move him he s mid air and he starts flying across room and I was like it s like you re a ballerina the way that your A A foot is turned out right now to look in and I literally sat there in the kitchen like holding him looking in his eyes being like are you okay what did I just do am I such a bad parent and then but then he like as soon as I opened his food he was like A A you bro I m hungry and I was like okay I think we re all good but it was a real moment I had this morning it was very traumatizing and I was never gon na share it but then you said I scratched my dog s eye and I was like well if we re talking about accidents I wasn t like I wasn t like scratching at his eye to keep him out of bubs s food and I wasn t kicking at him and folds to protect him from a yeasty on his Beastie anyway so I had to take him back to the vet to make sure that his eye had healed and it had healed and the doctor was like I m so impressed with how you guys administered this medicine I was like thank you how did you do that like a A A boss because Uno scratched his cornea oh it was so devastating he was sitting there like this is the world s worst event ever yeah because you have to put a cone on them so they don t itch it and they re just sort of sitting there looking at you like this there was a time that I thought we were never gon na get out of cones in our household dude it was like Uno s cornea Riley had to get neutered then Louie got I don t know the difference between neuter and Spain I was blowing around whatever so anyway he s cured but when I went back to the vet I took bubs with me so I could be like look dude we re going to the A A bat like I m never taking this A A somewhere you would want to be without you so I take bubs and I m like you know since we re here we re gon na get his claws A A managed so on the way there I m driving on the one one with both of them icky s a A A nightmare he s jumping all over the place I m like I can t do this like we re gon na get in a car accident and we re all gon na die so I put him in the back seat and he takes a A A in my back seat while I m driving down the and it s raining and I m just like well I can t do anything about that so there s just A A live turds rolling around back there he s A A jumping around like a maniac I ve got him coming up going back coming up going back he s on the floor he s on the floor back there all of it s a A A nightmare I have to pull over eventually and pick up the poop in a little poop bag and just put it in my A A cup holder like because I m not gon na just throw A A out onto the street because I m not a monster and then we get to the vet and I give him to the vet to go back and get his cornea checked and I go can you guys give bubs a nail trim and they go did someone call you about that and I said no I just thought I d bring him because I was bringing Ikea no so we have a we ve flagged his profile because last time he was here I guess he was a little bit aggressive and we had a hard time doing his nails and I was like nobody said anything about that to me they were like well has he had a sedative this morning I was like no my dog doesn t wake up and takes a A A Ritalin like he s a good boy he s a good boy he s a good man to this podcast because you know that he ll bite all of us no every time I go to your house Bob goes because he s protecting us and then I walk and he s like I sat down in Lizzie s office and Bud was just like you were antagonizing him do that to animals like drop kicked his cat for example but like Chino so like Cheeto never in his wildest dreams would like play by Shane because Shane like doesn t ever like instigate him but for me I m like putting like my hand in cheetah s face like this and she was like but we have fun it s like fun for us we have fun yeah so he and he s abusive to my dog so my dog says I m just sick of your A A and Rylan has a problem with that anyway I just said maybe nothing happened maybe they just seen his Instagram account and they think that he s aggressive so if you guys want to just try you could just try they re like yeah we ll try and I was like no pressure like if nobody feels if somebody doesn t feel good about it or if you feel unsafe if he sheds blood it s you know it s your problem not mine but I m so sorry that that had happened to you so they take him back and he s a good boy and he got his nails trim wow I said see he s a good boy he s a fine boy he s a good boy say it he s a good man yeah yeah okay well I hate to break it to you what our intro has gone out of style I A A told you this was gon na happen when we did this in Colorado I was like bro it s four more episodes here and then we re back and I get caught and I couldn t take the constant bullying from the comment section and I m like okay we ll get a new A A intro guess what we got a new A A intro and now everyone s mad again that it s from Colorado okay calm down scaring the children I m so sorry please apologize to my goddaughter right now I forgot her name you A A rat Lily it s okay Lily Lily it s okay um yeah so I don t know do I just use the old one that we made three I don t want to use the old one anymore because it makes me feel bad about myself okay settled you guys are getting a Colorado intro and that s just the way it is but I think we should do oh what I was gon na say I think we should revamp the Cali one oh my gosh we were here for six months now oh my gosh we re not here for six months you re not no I thought you were I have alpacas waiting for you when are you going home I don t know six months from now an undisclosed amount of time I know I got a call like don t hate me I m on my way back right now that s what we did last year because I started having like breakdowns and I was like I got ta get out of here this is crazy the way that he lives his life makes me A A crazy yeah it makes me crazy too but guess what the sun s coming out this week so everything s fine okay it s about to pop out over this mountain and we re gon na be so happy I can I make a pitch what because we also don t want to have a Christmas A A intro during summer you made a very specific Choice when you had US Film during this year it wasn t Christmas oh there s snow yeah oh so what I think we should do is we should do an intro that is non locationally tied and not seasonal fine okay we ll think about it I have an idea okay obviously I m pitching you later because it s got to be a big reveal okay um I felt really left well okay do you want to talk about the rain that ruined my life or me feeling left out from your antics what s specific about the railroad in your life we get back to this house oh no and it s leaking it s been leaking not forever no no I found a leak in this house last year what number oh I think that was like an AC problem this is the problem we oh my gosh no because it doesn t rain like this in Los Angeles and it s been raining non stop for like two weeks yeah and so it s really testing everyone s roofs and so we found out that the roof needs to be replaced and now it s gon na cost like so much money and it s ruined everything and now I m gon na have to hear people banging up there on my roof for two weeks sounds like a good time for us to go to Mexico I think so should we yeah take a trip to Mexico I mean obvious well I got ta get my passport renewed because I lost it um my passport expires in October but I feel like you ll be gone by then so we should go now I have an appointment in two days oh my gosh let s go to the Esperanza yeah let s go Esperanza okay I don t know what s going on with Jenny in Georgia But Lizzy is talking about it with Instagram as like it s some hit things well I m talking about it on Instagram you ve never told me talk about it with me no that s not true I always like to be included in shows but you won t watch the show that s not true then watch the show I will watch the show but what s the drama in the storyline like you re asking people are they team Genie or Georgia Ginny okay and it s a mother daughter Duo and so what s the beef uh should we give advice you texted me and you said don t give any spoilers so I can t tell you the beef well you can t tell me their issue we can t solve it on this podcast I will give you a a uh umbrella of their issue and that is that Ginny feels her mother Georgia is um overbearing and that her personality takes the center stage and that she has become sort of a sidekick or an afterthought to it all so her mom s a narcissist yeah she thinks so but I think that her mother is doing everything within her power to protect her children and is this a popular show yeah I hope so I mean I don t know I like it I ve got it s I like that this isn t who stars in this I don t I don t know these people okay um but it s I m really enjoying it I ve enjoyed two seasons of it and I had to wait forever for the second season to come and I think I m gon na have to wait forever for the third season

Globe like everything like eight I know I know that so so like eight posts a day like she s always posting eight posts today I m gon na do this I m gon na and then she doesn t win but she s like freaking out for like her co star or the person that does win and she s like yeah yeah and then I guess that moment went kind of viral like we need this energy of women supporting women yeah and now Jamie Lee Curtis is like reposting the meme of yourself like different times it s like okay Jamie Lee yeah I know you have a problem with her I don t have a problem with her okay I have a probably one person and you re over here on the podcast A A on literally all of Hollywood someone s got to if I don t who will speaking of Jamie Lee Spears what s her name this is like Brooklyn Beckham Jamie Lynn Spears she s on that wild show did you see that link uh yes Special Forces which is crazy because Shane and I watched the first episode over the weekend oh really yeah I just saw a trailer first like if you want to see Jamie Lynn Spears wearing a hood over her head getting dropped from a helicopter headfirst into the ocean like what so they take all these celebrities who are maybe retired or has gone through something no they do like one of the Spice Girls is on it like one of the biggest NBA stars they have like all walks of life happening inside of this show and they re going through some sort of like military boot camp to see if they can pass and it like tests like physical emotional they re in the desert in the heat with limited food and they re like putting them through all of these crazy obstacle courses like they re like jumping backwards out of a helicopter crazy and so we watched it because I was like yeah what s gon na happen with Jamie I got Dr Drew s on it he leaves oh I guess I shouldn t give any spoilers but uh it s it s interesting but like the tone is so weird like that can you listen to me I m listening to you no I don t think you are no I am I m reading the Articles I m telling you about it I watched the show and she s reading the article live on the book I m not reading the article I m looking for the pictures girlfriend okay continue so like it is fun to watch them do these challenges but then they try to like get them to break in like this weird closed off room and the military guys are like we don t know anything about you but and then they like go into their whole history and try to like push their trigger points what is the breaking point uh like what is it well they push them physically they put them through like so they quit so this is how like the end to see who lasts yeah who can make it to the end and in the first episode like two people are already out like Kate Gosling and to get out you quit you just go I m done you quit or you like break a bone or you re dehydrated and you have to tap out A A can you imagine being that A A up for cash then you re like yeah I ll do special I think I think I would Shane probably wouldn t

rocketmoney com sip rocketmoney com are you ready for some piping hot topics really there s a lot going on in the world there is a lot going on in the world it s award season girlies are dropping music where do you want to start um I guess we ll start with Miley Cyrus who served Liam uh Hemsworth some perfectly Petty single music and music video on his birthday more than the message it was her walking up the streets in the Hollywood Hills in that YSL gown just like dropping it for me do you know where she was going no do you know the full drama and the full tea I feel like okay I saw all these headlines where she s like dragging Liam Hemsworth in the song and I go and listen to the song and yes it s definitely about Liam Hemsworth because she s like we bought the house in Malibu that burned to flames which is like couldn t be talking about anyone else yeah but then I listened to all the other lyrics and I didn t hear her once talk about him cheating with like people while they were married so the house that she filmed this at is the house that he rented to A A other women in while they were married and how do we know that uh because someone said so I think somebody did okay I m not invalidating that I just want to know the source because if it was some random A A on Tick Tock that s like this house was rented by Liam Hemsworth in and I think he A A women I happened to be one of the like that s like if this is true I m A A pissed for Miley Cyrus but I just don t think it I don t know that well he would say I m gon na go work out so that s why she s working out in the video and she s wearing the suit that he was wearing that they got married in and that he was wearing at The Avengers movie premiere where he told her to behave herself he wore the same suit it s his suit that she s wearing but he wore it to his wedding and the Avengers premiere yeah I m sorry that s what I took from that oh you think that s tacky I mean I just think it s odd which was first I mean I know some kids like have like a suit but he could probably borrow a suit like he s Miley Cyrus s husband I think any stylist in the world or any like brand would be like yeah we ll dress him that s what I m saying like literally so it is a little weird but damn her body like I don t like is it wrong to comment on somebody s body in today s world if you think she looks good you can say so I just wow that A A hits Pilates like daily yeah I was like whoa I think that often when I look at her like but I also think like singers like they have to do so much to stay in shape for singing for like two hours on stage her daily life is a parkour course you know I feel like Miley s just ready she s like ready yeah I feel like you could be like I feel like she takes on a grocery store like it s a parkour course like I feel like I could see her like running up walls everywhere she goes she s like like she s like the cereals on the top ledge and she s like yeah she s like a monkey she s like swinging through coming in on a wrecking ball when she has it she s doing a triple back flip off the top shelf with her cereal box I just feel like she s that A A she s got she is that A A I love her I love that she is sending this is unrelated and I didn t put it on here but JoJo siwa posted a pretty funny Tick Tock in response to the music video where she s like doing all these other things but she s like not doing it right because all she s thinking about is the music video so it s like overlaid over the music video so JoJo s just like pouring water on herself thinking about the music video and like overspraying her like whipped cream and she s just thinking about this because she s a lesbian I get it she s a little lazy um go I just can t get over the visual of her walking up the Hollywood Hills in that A A gown yeah I just like could watch that that like four seconds over and over and over like I could probably get off to that okay okay I d like to see you try okay wow no I don t want to see it is that what my only fans should be I think gay man comes to straight porn it s like Hilary Duff and Miley Cyrus is that quick readable is that a good clickbait title Abraham comes to straight things maybe I m not I don t know well I also liked uh that there s another article I found called Hell hath no fury um and that s like then a woman scorned but apparently Shakira also came out with a Revenge song today for her ex because they split up and this was just like a list of like a bunch of different women who had come out with Revenge songs I don t know is that interesting to you should we move on I m gon na like if you have like a tidbit for me I wanted to go through it together but if you don t oh Demi Lovato s song which one when she s about being finally how about Wilmer yeah yeah I mean I think people like pop stars sing about their lives and of course they re gon na sing about when somebody A A them over yeah it s so crazy that I ve been scrolling for like minutes and there s not a single A A mention of Taylor Swift here did you find any facts Chris um So based off what I ve found uh there are a lot of people that believe that was the house uh that she was cheated on in but there s nothing confirmed this just it seems to be a lot of speculation uh who started the speculation I don t know on Tick Tock oh it was listed somewhere else because no one on Tick Tock has their own ideas because all the websites are like poland postson com you know what I mean like it s not life I feel like Miley will hit up caller daddy before the album comes out and maybe we ll get some clarity the only statement I found from Miley was from saying basically saying she was not cheated on and that was in read the statement because it sounds like you re saying she basically said well it says here let me find the quote I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating is what it says interesting take that Tick Tock no I mean that might mean that she didn t cheat oh yeah I mean I don t know I would just say until I know that until it s like TMZ reporting with facts I m not gon na take some girl on a green screen and tick tock s word for it but this A A believed in Santa so I mean yeah but a lot of people seem to think that it is the house yeah a lot of Articles so all right all right what do you have for us um Kim Kardashian threw an insane A A Birthday Bash for Chicago s fifth even this took my breath away like a ramen bar I mean that was the least impressive part for me no do you know how expensive good ramen is to have a whole A A ass bar she carpeted her entire house pink because it was raining I think it also might have to be because her floors are probably nicer than that shit ass carpet they just rolled out so she s probably protecting her floor regardless of course but a stunning display what do they do while all of this is being set up they Instagram it on one of her Instagrams I feel like I could see the crew that was setting up and they like one guy comes around a corner and sees her camera and just goes right behind the corner I just genuinely want to know the price tag on a party like this because we re looking minimum of k it s a lot for one day maybe a few hours and some Instagram posts yeah like it must be nice to be racking in Kim Kardashian money I just even feel like I mean I don t know I m not a billionaire I wonder what I would no I probably would I d probably be out of control because I m not a billionaire and I m like edging on out of control that s what I m saying these parties just truly take my breath away I love that s all there is to it Kim calls her her mini like her twin because shy does look the most like her and she also seems like the sweetest one North scary as A A did you see that might be out of that court that Chloe posted of them singing happy birthday to shy oh my God A A North is like happy birthday she s Kanye okay it was like it was scary it was some of that like impulsive this is a child I think we got ta move on I was I mean I it s some of that I m an impulsive child who did weird things like that too and I m A A scare myself so as a former A A scary impulsive child I can say that there are impulse control issues biologically passed down from her father wow okay I m not the only the almost terrified of Northwest I don t know why you re acting like this is some a hot take and I m a monster to get kids she s a kid all right moving on and no hate dude I ll take us I ll take this one on okay Britney Spears is Joey outing leave this A A alone you guys A A leave her alone yeah you guys need to chill the A A out this is so toxic I was enraged for her and since this restaurant by your house yes we used to go there all the time to get that fried chicken sandwich but you can only go during the day like if Britney would have called me I would have said you can absolutely not go to Joey s on a Friday night like a non famous person has a hard time dealing with the amount of people at Joey s on a Friday night like it s so busy that it s a mad house yeah I would have just said hey girl Brittany we ll go there on a Tuesday morning when everyone s at work and at school but Friday night no no no no no girl I also would have said Brittany you don t need a Red Bull and they re all reporting on the fact that she s like having a full blown meltdown and speaking gibberish and it s like yeah every A A in that restaurant turned to her pulled their phone out like she s the A A zoo animal and started recording her how would you react you idiots I hate I just hate it like Justin Bieber had multiple breakdowns about like feeling as though he was a zoo animal and it s like you guys are causing this further this woman just wants to go out to dinner like everybody else because it is like what do people enjoy in life one of those things is going out and enjoying a nice meal yeah and Brittany is not allowed to do that she had a bodyguard she had her husband with her and still people were just like and then it becomes this huge news story Sam walks out to go get his car and everyone s like Sam stormed out on Brittany in a rage because he was the speculation of it all I m just like you guys are so A A toxic and he s like Paparazzi the next day being like I went to get the car for her it was probably downpouring because it has been for two weeks in California and I just feel bad for the girl just let her go out to eat you guys let me live anyway anyway what s next the critic s choice was last night but I couldn t tell you anything A A about it because I I can t find it anywhere it s on the CW and it s like nobody has the CW still exists it s like and I looked I have YouTube TV can t find the CW so I would love to tell you Critics Choice who are the critics it s just another one of the Golden Globes I m sure you ve been to one when you were you know gallivanting about town yeah sure so we can t tell you anything about the Critics Choice Awards because I couldn t find anything on it even though Chelsea Handler was hosting so I probably would have wanted yeah I think I heard her opening monologue was funny and she poked fun at that new diet supplement that I guess is like an actual yeah it s actually medication for diabetics skinny all the celebrities are doing it yeah also can we like stop normalizing this A A terrifying skinny culture there s yes but can we just like stop it they re doing spin offs for I mean the spin offs are actually for quote unquote obesity to help because it curbs your appetite and it does slow down your like want to eat unnecessarily so they re making people did start taking the diabetes drug itself and now they re spin offs that are created for like obesity and so but I think what popularized it like allegedly that s what all of the Kardashians like Chloe and Kim got on like a year or two ago before it became super mainstream and popular in Hollywood and now it s going like yeah Nationwide I mean sure but also like extreme dieting in people who are not obese and who do not have the the need to have an extreme diet right I was looking at pictures of one of I m not gon na name names because I also think that s toxic but I was looking at pictures of a woman that I idolized as a child world and I m looking at her and like as an adult now I m like this person looks ill right like this person is so thin that I can see their bones and the outlines of their muscles and it s not because they re buff it s because they re too thin and we just never know I mean everyone s going through their own mental absolutely everyone has their own body issues absolutely and at the same time I m like I know this person s diet because they ve boasted about it there are articles online of them bragging about how little they eat right and it s like I m sick of it yeah and like it s because it s wild to me it s wild to me that I m told over and over to eat healthy I have to not eat and I m like that sounds bad I mean I think I mean that s very Hollywood and it sucks that like Hollywood is projecting that out because they have a megaphone right but I mean I think we should just exit the chat if somebody s doing like I don t think we should be influenced by the people that are no but it s hard not to because Hollywood is who we look up to these are the people that we see the most of that they re public they re publishing their nutritional diet plans and they re calling it things like this is my nutritionist plan for me but it s like I don t know a single A A actual Doctor Who would say yeah consume under this amount of calories a day as a grown ass person I m curious about whose diet it is I m thinking of a couple people but I ll tell you about it after the podcast because I don t want to like send people off and running to find these things but the point being is if you re overthinking about the food that you re eating stop it eat what your body needs I m not talking about going out and like getting a A A big gulp of nacho cheese because I ve done that and I have to say afterwards I don t feel well but put fuel in your body that makes you feel well and feel well about it yeah there s no A A harm in eating and feeling good about what you re A A eating enjoy your A A food A A sorry Mama I saw a great Tick Tock last night because I m also on my period And I was like well I guess I should go to the gym and this Tick Tock was like don t go to the A A gym on your period don t punish yourself for being on your period and needing to consume more calories because you re on your A A period like all these things it s like oh my God I did I do do that like in my mind I m like well I guess I m gon na restrict myself and not have that things like A A why yeah like A A why I really liked uh my during the holidays my yoga teacher kept being like do not come here as a punishment to yourself yeah eating more because you re eating more than you usually would come here to like mentally reset enjoy yourself yeah and feel good but like don t go as a punishment going in as a punishment also makes the experience that much less fun yeah like when I actually had like yesterday it was like a rainy day I was doing my laundry I was like having a productive at home Sunday and I was like I m gon na go work out because I have the time to and when you like go because you want to and because you feel like you want the endorphins from your body is so much better than being like I have to fit this in before I work hours this week because and I m punishing myself for what I ate over the weekend it s awful no I like to go to the gym because it helps me A A sleep at night because my brain is a A A Whirlwind of A A helps exhaustion it exhausts my body it makes me happy and it s like I m also I ve never been the type of person who works towards like an actual like I don t even know the word for it but it s like a benchmark goal you know what I mean guess how A A fast I ran a mile last week wow yes um okay nine eight minutes and seconds wow A A dude right that s good I m a A A good ass Runner A A and that s why I like going to the gym I like to have this like I know I could do this I know guess how fast I can Route meters well I don t know anything about that seconds that s fast okay I don t know what that means I m just saying like these are the things I m proud of and no and you should be yeah but it s like I want to normalize doing things because they re A A good for you because you enjoy doing them because they make you feel A A good because they make you proud and I think it s good to be proud of eating A A well no for sure the Golden Globes were something I could watch Laughter it was made exciting you wanted me I mean there were like clips and I uh it was on YouTube TV so I recorded it and then I like would fast forward to people I loved one of which being Jennifer Coolidge oh my gosh I just live and love for her having this moment in her life because it s interesting from the outside to think she s always in my head been killing it like she s a staple in a lot of the entertainment I ve consumed but when she s accepting Her speech it was her first Golden Globe win and she s like I always had small jobs that would lead me to the next and I d barely chug along and I was like crawling my way to what I thought was success but life was happening and it was never like it never happened for me the way like that I felt I was working for it that s how I interpreted it at least and for her to have this moment I think like back to back I don t think she mentioned the Watcher it was really mainly the White Lotus but I feel like she s having all of these massive things blow up right now and it s so incredible to watch her at this not I don t want to be like ageist but it s incredible this chapter because in Hollywood it is like as you get older you like phase out and she s not being faded out at all thanks to a lot of great opportunities and I love that even she was like Ariana Grande changed my life in a lot of ways overnight asking me to be in the thank you next music video and then just her I I just like her being like I m getting invited to all the parties on my hill from all my neighbors I ve never been popular like this I and then she s like in the Old Navy commercial she s just like saying yes and everyone s asking I just like I couldn t be more excited for somebody s success I love her and I m like is she trolling or is this who she is that s because we ll never know well that s what s so beautiful what s the world I ve always wanted to play a dolphin like what like flipper yeah well you re pretty good I love her in her interview she s not much different than like every character which I think is the A A core of a beautiful actor someone who can bring exactly who they are to these lines and and be authentic like I A A love this A A you know we ve been really into the Real Housewife of Beverly Hills we like go we like finished the recent seasons and then we re watching backwards we ll like finish season seven and go to season six or whatever and so somebody like Jennifer is vocal about her love for watching The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills too so at one of the interviews at the Golden Globes they were like would you ever join and she s like oh A A yes I would oh hell yeah and I was like that s what I need in my life to like see her in like White Lotus and then also have her on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills it s like I want to see her in real life like I want to see her Mansion I want to see her like I want to see her day today and be able to compare it to her acting jobs it s probably the same which unless she s trolling but I don t think she is I just couldn t be more excited for her and then the Creator Mike White of the White Lotus when you used to serve it you used to serve him at penguin really yeah and I used to serve him at the juice box see I was a uh he liked the grapefruit mint drink wow yeah um is this his first Big Show no okay yeah he also wrote School of Rock I just love that in his acceptance speech did you see it when he won for the white line honestly the Golden Gloves I was like is this so it seriously awkward he s like kind of drunk and he s like saying he s looking at everyone in the room and he s like for a show to have so much success that every one of you in this room passed on I m sure they did I m sure they A A did I started thinking though I mean the even the first season is like an All Star cast like Connie Britton I love I think she s incredible like Jennifer Coolidge they really hit a home run with having Sydney Sweeney before she really Rose to fame with Euphoria but I just thought it was funny that he s like oh you in this room passed on this little show yeah so I think he s A A great he was like sobbing in the audience for Jennifer Coolidge yes Mommy loved him I love him and then you would put this in some girl from like the dragon show was drunk Oh I thought you would care about that I watched the clips and she didn t even really talk she was just back there like acting like she had three cocktails yeah I don t know why Twitter and Tick Tock got all crazy about it I mean I think we do know why why because it s Twitter and Tick Tock and they go crazy about A A everything yeah you can fart and they d be like okay Haley Bieber rocks the nepo baby shirt have you seen so you know nepo baby is like all the fad to talk about these days it s like nepo babies go back to the dawn of time A A like well I think is my assumption is that Tick Tock is discovering all of these famous people have famous parents and then they found the term and now they re mad at all these celebrities that have famous parents correct and so a lot of these celebrities now because Tick Tock I m assuming is enraged or being asked about it in interviews like their thought on being a nepo baby and they re all like Tom Hanks is like look I ve got five kids only one is successful tell me nepo babies could have helped these up like what s going on with Chet you know what I mean nepotism couldn t help chat to save his A A life and I like Kate Hudson was interviewed and she was like the nepotism thing I mean I don t really care I look at my kids and we re a storytelling family it s definitely in our blood people can call it whatever they want but it s not going to change it also and yeah my theory on all of the people that are enraged about nepo Bay babies it s like these kids are growing up in households where their parents are professional actors all they know is growing up on a set watching their parents run lines if it s family friendly content they re probably running lines with their parents because it s really a good uh exercise for a kid even to play imaginary to read to memorize when I was little to keep me still Helen would give me scripts to read and she was like if you give me notes on these I ll take you and get your hair done later so so like I grew up reading scripts and my point being these kids lives are acting so if they choose to act they re going to probably be good actors because it s been in their blood their entire life and so the thing for like I believe there s room for everyone I think there s also a lot of people in Hollywood that moved from the middle of nowhere brought their car out here and have found massive success Selena Gomez if you re hating on all of these people who are nepo babies what if you became successful and then you have a kid and they re now privy to that success then you are what you re hating on the internet it just doesn t make sense to me no and I agree with all of that but I also can not stand Will Smith s children oh I m just kidding you should probably cut that Laughter the thing also though like you re saying with Tom Hanks is like you can you can open doors for somebody but it s not gon na stick unless they re great like Chris who are we talking about the other day that you re like I didn t realize they had famous parents and I was like yeah but they re really A A good like they really brought it do you remember who that was like we we actually had an organic I mean I don t remember specific we named a few people I know one was the girl from stranger things who I was like oh look at this up and coming actress she s incredible and then her mom was like Uma Thurman or something oh yeah and uh and but she s incredible and super charming and like I I hate how much I love her yeah and what I thought she I think I if I m being honest I was like oh here s a new up and coming person good for them they got a break and then I found out like Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke s daughter yeah like truthfully I was a little bummed by that but she s incredible I don t I think that the bummer comes from uh the less privileged of us who don t have that kind of wealth and availability and I think but but no matter what that the facts remain Chet Hanks has the same wealth and availability as Colin yet no A A career for it do you know what I m saying and I I stand by saying there s room for everyone you can come from absolutely nothing and uh work your job to work a little harder you have to work a little harder but that makes you enjoy the success all that much more in my opinion though there s a woman on Shark Tank and I don t know remember quadrant is she the shorter is she the short haired one uh that Jennifer Lawrence made a movie about Joy oh yeah so she has a whole thing in her heart of heart she s like I don t like to work with nepo babies she s like they don t work as hard they are not hungry for it they have nothing to prove I like to work with somebody who comes from a different background who s been hurt or wronged has something to prove a A A Vendetta she s like one of my business associates has a father who left and never spoke to him and later in life when he got the riches that he worked his A A ass off for I want to bet on that kid because he s got something to prove to that dad like all that all of those things and all of that is true because these nepo babies most of them have families that have a lot of money so if they decide I don t need to show up to work today they re fine they don t need to make the dollar yeah but there I I bet and that s why I think even like Kate Hudson like acting I feel is a little different than like entrepreneurship right because if you re like passionate about theatrics and you like that s what moves you and that s what keeps you going I think that is a little different than being like an entrepreneur in a business which I do think like I think that s very similar though because both are like self startery things where you have to be a hustler and you have to go out and make these things happen for yourselves and sure you know a famous person can get their kid an agent but a famous person can t make their kid talented and never have a work ethic or have a work ethic and it s like it s Hollywood s proven time and time again if you don t show up on time you re out and more than being a nepo baby or not a nepo baby people have different personalities like you could be privy to anything and have a good work ethic or a bad work ethic yeah you know what I m saying yeah okay um do you wan na which of these do you want to hit on oh was it price Dallas Howard oh my gosh yes we were talking about Jurassic world who looks exactly like her father and she s great in those movies she s very talented wait what is this oh Megan was cut to cater for teens after the trailer goes viral you put that in oh so I guess the making trailer really did go viral yeah and so one of the writers is saying that Universal then cut a bunch of the Gory kills because they wanted to cater to a lot of the teens that added to the virality of the trailer um that s not something I would have ever known inside of the movie I think like Shane was a little disappointed because not because he didn t think the movie was good but because there was so much hype and because like the reviews from critics were so like out of this world amazing he was like well it fell flat to me in comparison to the reaction right but I didn t really consume any of that I went in open hearted and I was like Wow and I I like Allison Williams I feel like she shows up in a lot of things that I enjoy uh Allison Williams has been resurfacing for me because people have found a new hatred for girls which I appreciate because I there is nothing I hate more than that whole A A series are they hating on her now no but she s a loathsome character in it the way that she expresses herself and the things that she does and one of the things that s going like around on Tick Tock right now is her character made a music video that s just so bad and so that music video is going viral right now and like some of the comments were funny like wow to have the confidence to perform this scene knowing some people aren t gon na know this wasn t just a private Endeavor of yours we could know though too yeah Brian Williams yeah well but very different categories he s a news he s like a Nightline news reporter right but like we just take a minute and just just like the people he does know the people that Rylan does know are very A A odd to me very Niche very Niche and it makes no sense no Laura Dern also an apple baby see um but yeah also I was confused by this because I thought we were talking about Megan why can t you use this to more of your advantage that is an off air conversation okay oh H s book H H yeah I want to talk about ages do we need to break down and come back for H well well I definitely need to break down it ll make it easier for you to cut that A A out I got a Costco pack of two like water bottles and I heard that new water bottles make a new woman so if you want one of them I could you know we could be new women together okay one day three Mark do you really want to be water bottle buddies yeah why not for real it s like one of the big ones with like you got ta is it like a Stanley oh it s not a statement A A you okay let s talk about it A A I just don t want it I don t even know what the rage about Stanley is it looks like a really basic A A cup honestly like I bought a Stanley Cup before my wedding to drink Smoothies Out of and like does it do anything no and nobody has them at the time and it s like it s annoying it doesn t fit in any A A cup holder like it s an annoying ass cup I hate it I m not into it A A you and A A your Stanley Cup too yeah okay also every time someone talks about it I m like do they mean like hockey okay so this H book H s book is it called spiraling what s it called a spider I don t know but people care it sold like million physical copies in the first day have you watched I could be making that up who cares about everything here is made up it s really it s a lot of books yeah people don t buy books so like people care I mean I think people are buying it for the virality of the A A in it and it s like I ve seen one super positive thing and I ll open on that and then we ll just dive into ripping this guy I do A A but he wrote a really beautiful tribute to his mother in it okay and then he said a lot of other dumb A A things so what s the penis clip going around because apparently he had like out of context I don t understand the clip and I m like am I stupid or are you guys not explaining I mean I think it s insane that it was written into his Memoir but what was the problem with his penis what s that A A called when your dick s exposed to the cold for too long well it s not just your dick but anything also I would love to know the context how frostbite he got frostbite yeah I m like how did you get frostbite on your dick he was probably doing some like anything of service and I m some and we re all A A for being like we re thinking you know this is the problem about talking about somebody s book that we haven t read because I know from a lot of these books that people write headlines about they just take anything they can to make a nasty headline well you know know he is bloating people s guns for them with nastiness I also picture pitched a segment where he just goes through and opens all the tick tocks next week I think we should yeah all all like put in a note document every tick tock you ve sent that I haven t opened and we can do that on the show amazing so there s one where he s like the first time I did cocaine I was at a party and I saw a baggie full of what I thought was powdered sugar and I m used to powdered sugar going on this pastry that I can t remember the name of and I looked to my friend and I said friend where s the pastry that I can t remember the name of and he said H you re the pastry that s the entire thing like what you know what I m saying like does he read his audiobook yeah wow that s why I did that voice I m not listening to it you re not numb okay I mean I have big hopes still like I keep saying every week I m gon na watch the Netflix documentary and it s like I m never gon na watch it no you re never you re a liar yeah I like I want to I have good intentions but I want to wake up at am but like we could do yeah who we are yeah yeah and you know who else is and who they say they are Julia Roberts wow come back next week and find out why everyone knows so as I went viral and then I tried clicking on the clip and I was like this I was like trying to follow and it s like when somebody says my aunt s nieces nephews and uncle and I m like to be fair that s a lot of things for this guy right yeah like too much and then I was like okay she s not a robbers who cares like her last name like I m not a Ryland Shane s not a Dawson who cares right she s a great actress did you know that today is Martin Luther King Day yeah did you know that Martin Luther talking paid for Julia Roberts s birth what yeah so her family I guess was tight with him and when they delivered her in the hospital the Kings paid for her mother s birthing bills oh my gosh that is incredible that is pretty cool that is a hot fact that s a hot fact but she

did you want to talk about your thoughts on julia fox before we get into what s really going on yeah by the time this airs days ago julia fox went out in public with a pair of pants so low you could see her mom s pubis vicky weigh in well you got to show her a picture if you re just going to ask her to weigh in like that i mean the words are enough i don t know if i feel comfortable showing your mom another lady s mom s pubis well the thing about julia fox is she s out there getting attention with her cookie out dude okay liz i don t know if i should be looking at this now i probably got ice cream she s like a pardon my french vicki because i don t feel great saying this in front of you but she s like a A A centaur what is the definition of a centaur i hope i didn t get ice cream on your phone it s okay if you did okay there s also salmonella on it so wash your hands before you lick them Laughter touching my phone s like holding a reptile you got ta wash your hands after the control freak in me is having a hard time with this episode right now you don t say oh earlier today he s like i don t like how you re being about the car you re being too woke for the car and then he gets in and he can t take a deep breath because he s so stressed out about it because i m lizzy the whole time we re setting up mom lizzy s like i m just gon na eat a salad and then i ll help you out and i m like i ve been editing the the previous week s episode all morning i m trying to produce it i m like minutes i was like yeah eight four minutes up yet to help you sleep i m like do you think you could help produce the topics in today s show and she s like yeah yeah yeah hey we re talking about julia fox s A A right now she wasn t laying on the floor i ll look into um some miv A A minutes later did you find any no they all suck wow you are rewriting history right now i am not you are gaslighting degrees outside and i m out here hauling all of this equipment into the car and she s like i ll be right out minutes later i m like drenched in sweat i walk inside and i m like oh she said she was gon na help and she s like oh she s a liar i mean i i did say it multiple times i haven t been to baskin robbins in a year i feel like i m more of a cold stone person regularly i don t A A with that A A called stone i don t think i should either after trying baskin robbins boston robbins is like a simple perfect pleasurable but my only beef with them is they don t show their fl there was a lot of retail on the screen for them to show what was going on seems like they used to be there and did you want a cone no i m kind of pissed that i don t have a cone quite honestly well they were even out of all the cones okay so what were your thoughts on julia fox i just think it s bat A A crazy that she s walking around with her cookie out and the other thing is she can t even walk because her lapy is about to spill out too imagine imagine you re in public with your best friend and her labia falls out the top of her pants and so the bottom and what part s the labia like those aren t the lips right i think it s the lips you don t even know we ve been over this no one talked to me about my female anatomy i grew up with barbies that had smoothed over crotches well somebody s gon na have to talk to my daughter if i ever have one about what her vagina is and that s why we have vicky that will be lizzy do you know what that ll be listen this is a lot but maybe mom could you could tell people what the labia is without me listening i m pretty sure it s the lips i m eating i think she s working out a lot obviously she likes the way her body looks and that s how she knows she gets attention so if she s happy doing it i mean what s the difference from having an only fans or just living your life is what she views as an art piece hmm i think you just have a what would you call it like a something on your shoulder a chip a chip on your shoulder um i don t know that i have a she s an enraging person i think that s really what it is you know what i mean like she she makes me A A crazy that julia fox can you believe you re bringing my mom into like celebrity gossip like because you re talking A A about a public persona you re making my mom sit up front lick or ice cream i m just the driver can you imagine a drama channel picking up my mom talking about julia fox your box today on the drama channel vicki adams explains to ryland what a labia is i m still unclear the diagram the lips bro you weren t clear i m so i put money on it s the lips okay so i was looking at my recent vlog i mean recent for me i know this is an episode in the future but there were some um hot name ideas for our puppy that has already that already has a name i was thinking you guys named her really quickly well and which didn t happen with okay that s gon na drive us there s paper in here oh shane would be loving this this is gon na drive me wait you guys there s paper inside my ice cream well show what you re talking about inside not on or if yeah trying to feed me paper vicky are they supposed to pull that out and they drive back through i m gon na give them a piece of my mind can you do me a favor and just suck the ice cream out and eat the cone after no i like to eat it together we can it s too well then you need to mute your mic i A A quit shane won t work i ve been meaning to walk off this show for a long time and if it takes not being allowed to eat my ice cream in this car okay if shane and i were celebrities yeah we would have named my puppy this is a can you just wait yes you would have named your puppy this person has suggested rain like r a y n e so it s a combination of shane and ryland but it s like rain which seems like a kim kardashian name right it is literally a courtney name her son s name is rain that s why but it s but i it s so funny that you re saying this because when i was watching your vlog earlier in the bathroom i thought because you brought her home in the rain i was like oh rain s cute and then i was like oh courtney has a dog name right isn t that like or something or regal like rei ga like isn t i feel like she spells it regularly and another one jared had called her cotton candy she was like oh she feels like cotton candy so somebody was saying a cute name would be candy which is a pretty cute name for a stripper candy okay rude for julia fox oh is she a stripper no she was a dominatrix all right well this isn t raging all right we re gon na break down and we re coming back with the love language test after she s finished this ice cream cone look at all the paper in there mom yes what s life like for you i wonder if i should drive back through for lizzy because that s not fair oh it s okay it s all the way around yeah is this intentional yeah that s what i m going to do they keep the cones separated by putting paper between them so they don t melt together because when you get wafer wet that it sticks but then that s like a choking hazard yeah they shouldn t have done this they specifically shouldn t have done it to a person who s filming a podcast about it and has an audience of like a hundred thousand people it s a bad look you know that s not like something that is appropriate to say right stating facts no like you re always that i have a podcast you want to say people it s like it s just like socially something that you re not supposed to run around i feel like someone should know how big the audience is before they speak because if it s an audience of two it s like but it s like not we re relatively not even a huge podcast no but a hundred thousand people is a lot of people it s not nothing but you can t walk around like i m not bragging about say to a hundred thousand it s not it s not a brag it s pretty socially unacceptable it s not a brag sometimes it s a threat or do you just whoa sorry or do you just sometimes feel like because everyone has a podcast you have to justify that there s some sort of audience like when you do you tell people you have a podcast like when you re on your hikes that you do with like random people that you don t know well when i told josh peck about the podcast i said we have about a hundred thousand did you ask him to come on the show of course i didn t even speak to josh peck i just took his picture from behind like a psycho um but sometimes i think it s important that a person who s calling in and doesn t know who they re talking to knows that a lot of people will hear it right doesn t that seem fair yeah and then when i m making threats i want people to know how damaging it s going to be that they A A me do you see what i m saying are you that girl that s like i will like a company does you wrong and you throw in them like i have a social media account listen i have a platform oh my god wow wow okay here have my cone when we come back a love language test and sonic today s podcast is sponsored by green chef green

to sonic well we re not going to sonic yet it s not out of possibilities okay it s still in play but i m just like trying to figure out what the actual talking points of the show are gon na be because here lizzie and i thought oh we re going to take the love language test with my mom it s going to be great she s going to figure out how she needs to be better loved or how like she can love her partner better and she s like i think you guys have already well vicki knows because vicki is a real one get you a mom like vicky he s the biggest fan she does watch every week and she well okay i did something that i do need to apologize for what do you remember last week when i played the voicemail comparing jared and my mom yeah shane was like funny you re comparing her to a man and like that s not very nice you did like a side by side well oh see that s why i thought it was funny well my whole thing was i thought they were saying you re his mom i never saw it as a comparison between a beautiful woman and a man and my whole thing was i just thought it was funny that this man was high off his ass thinking about how my mom could potentially look like jared and then my mom was like what and shane goes that is so mean for you to compare your mom to a man cancelled canceled cancelled okay so i thought it was funny since we ve already taken the love language test we ve decided that we will take the test how much of an A A are you is what it s titled how much of an A A do you think you are i don t think i m much of an A A i think i m pretty generous i think i can be an A A to like maybe you but i don t think to like the general public maybe to the people who had my couch that one time also are there any more donuts left can i eat a donut yeah there s a lot of donuts left thank you all right mom don t skip ahead okay so are we supposed to start if you want to take the quiz along with us you can i ll list the link in the description section below it s a buzzfeed quiz titled how much of an A A are you so the prompt is have you ever and the first is cancelled an appointment at the last minute mom you did this this week huh i did it last week to the dentist now i have to go tomorrow and what s your excuse why did you cancel what s the real excuse and what did you tell them oh let s see i told him i was busy at work that it just got really busy and why couldn t um because i was busy at work oh fine i don t have to go tomorrow and i m no less busy so i don t know well so it wasn t really a lie i don t really make appointments for myself so it s hard for me to i know that i can t commit up front so i just try not to make them at all and the time before that i canceled the same appointment because i didn t have a car they re gon na stop you from making appointments at this place no those are all super valid excuses thank you thank you yeah but day of they could have booked somebody else it s hard to get one but when you have a valid excuse all right when s the last time you canceled i cancelled yoga but i didn t even tell them i cancelled i just didn t show up well they probably charged you uh they didn t because i m on my free my free thing oh so it doesn t matter no all right no i have not done that stood somebody up no not like not without telling them not without canceling yeah i haven t either you just said you ve never canceled an appointment me not that i can remember but you said to stood someone up not without canceling that means you ve canceled well i m thinking appointment means doctor i don t think any appointment like a dick appointment i don t think an appointment is a friend hangout i wouldn t call like me meeting you for lunch an appointment oh i would i would call that hanging out with a friend like i ve canceled hanging out with a friend but i haven t not shown up somewhere after they ve already arrived and been like sorry not gon na make it when they re like sitting with their cold hot coffee all right um pretended to be sick to avoid going to a party yes hmm i don t mom i can t answer that why my mom no i just not pretended but by the time i have to go i think i m sick sometimes oh my gosh you make yourself sick i think i m sick sometimes you re so cute yeah well the most popular she gets invited to a lot of things and then she s like well i could just hang out with the family instead well that is my favorite thing so eat in other people s desserts instead of ordering one for yourself but i don t think that makes me an A A it depends on the relationship with the person you re stealing the dessert from i guess that s true and how much of it you re taking there are people that just do not like sharing food they re like if you wanted this you should have ordered it i m not one of those people i m not about to eat someone s food without permission to do so and without like if someone s like A A no i m like oh yeah cool i will offer my food if but like the other day i had like i ordered the best food when we all ordered dinner i got like this amazing chicken sandwich and everyone was like how is it and i could tell they were fishing for a bite and i was like it s great yeah i don t think anybody s ever entitled to a bite of your meal no but if there s like fries or it s like a dessert or i feel like that s fine but the main entree stay away stay away stay away unless you re married yeah i agree shane can take some yeah all right bummed a cigarette i don t smoke haven t done that offered a cigarette to someone who stopped smoking no nope borrowed money from someone yep my mom back when i was broke in la she was calling her mom to try to fund my bills everyone sent you money it was a hard time that was before go fund me i couldn t have started to go help i m in los angeles and nobody will give me a serving job i ve dared just follow my dreams i although i did email ellen once what did you say to ellen because you know how they do the like uh they ll like the oprah giveaway thing yeah the oprah giveaway stuff and i really like i would print out like resumes a day and go to go to ever and hand them to one restaurant until they were gone so i really was trying to get a job and pay for my bills and i was like anything i could do i made a sign once i emailed ellen i was like i m just you made a sign yeah like a panhandling sign i m not that i was homeless but i just was what did you say i can t get a job dude did i ever send you a picture of the sign mom i bet i probably have one on a text i ll have to leave yeah yeah i did it and i ve never left your trunk though i got a busboy job i can t remember it was when i was but it s competitive to get a restaurant job was it like hire me as a server sign no i i can t remember it was probably asking for money in some regard wow yeah i because my mom had gotten to the point where she said i have exhausted all resources in being able to send you money to cover your rent you need to come home there was a point in time where i could over draft my bank account if i went to the grocery store and asked to take cash out because if i said it was a credit card and to take it they would just approve it but i couldn t overdraft it and get cash elsewhere so i would use that to pay my rent but i was also paying like rent to live on a couch yeah yeah i was paying a month to live split a one bedroom with somebody at the time yeah so i got there but i never um yeah so i did borrow money borrowed money from someone and forgotten to pay them back probably i forgot though um i think that s bad i think but if you forget you forget i don t think you should forget if you ve taken out a loan from somebody because we re talking like a small loan we re talking like you know like lunch yeah to because if you take out more than from someone i don t think i ve ever asked anybody to borrow more than to okay because there have been times in the past where like i get in sticky situations where like somebody asks somebody else i know for money and it really is like a relationship breaker because i think the relationship s broken when the request for money is made personally and when the person feels like they can t say no yeah because the other person is in such a bind although like it s just money is a tricky thing and you and people don t want to feel used and so that s what i mean if you take a loan from somebody i think you should be as conscious as possible to make a payment plan to let them know how you re consciously going to be paying them back yeah unless you re willing to lose a friendship over taking money from someone which in that case i would say you are the A A oh absolutely well now i m worried that s going to count really bad against me when i m talking about like A A lunch well i mean i don t think it s scored like that okay you never know insulted someone that you didn t know on twitter or in the comments i mean i m sure every day cutting the line have you ever gotten in a fight with somebody on social media mom oh be honest once with a fan and i got in trouble from you guys and you got in a fight with somebody well it felt i i guess it wasn t a fight i just replied back to somebody did i get mad at you what was it in regard to i ll have to think about it but gosh sweet vicki i did i said something she might have had one too many glasses of wine and popped back i bet it ll come to me but yes i said something to a fan and then i got in trouble i think everyone s hit their breaking point at some time like i ve had my own moments as well where it s just like sometimes you reach a boiling point and you snap and it s like yes it s not cute and yes if you re snapping you should probably like take five steps back and consider why you snapped but i don t know it gets tricky out there sometimes yep okay cut in line lizzy i never we got so distracted on so many stories a couple episodes ago that i never really got to know you for this but the way that you talked about this guy nailing me and not taking me to sonic lizzy okay oh yes i don t know i know where you re going i have an example though because lizzy saw chris in the airport security line and was like my husband no that s a lie you were like no it s on the podcast right that s a joke that s a joke so you didn t go up in there i did but it s like i m traveling with him i would be A A crazy for me to not get in line with chris i think chris the appropriate thing to do in a line is for chris to meet you back where you are not for you to go of course why because those people have been patiently waiting one person and we re traveling together we go up to the kiosk together one person could be two people if five people do that then you re five minutes behind yeah five but families do do that dad will wait in line while mom and the ducks go pee pee and they get in line i don t agree because even when we went to the rockies game on the fourth of july uh one we were all trying to find different lines because all the food concessions were like very long lines yeah and so are you on multiple different tabs and well just hold on so because that s different if you re doing different arenas it s different so if you re traveling together it s not different so or it is different somebody else had gotten in a shorter line and i do not feel it s appropriate to meet them in the line where they re at unless you go back so at first i had gone back but then i agree so i found a short short line and i said text me your orders and i ll get it but for the everyone to join you in the line is inappropriate because it s like a big like well just because they texted you doesn t mean they re not joining you in the line yes but it s visual it s like it s the it s the optics for you yes because if four people join in front it s like and also you got to keep in mind this is at burbank airport in the southwest security line which is four minutes long every time it s four minutes long it moves like yeah it goes like crazy there wasn t even a real line i just wanted to stand with chris in the line while we waited for two minutes i understand i just think it s not like i m cutting in line to buy one of a limited op like of a limited item i m cutting in line to go through security with the guy i m going through security with and getting on an airplane i kind of agree with lizzie i think i ve done it at the airport but i even at the rockies game if you go to the airport with your husband and you go pee and your husband s in line are you going to make him step back in the line with you in security i ll try and if he says no i usually go with him but really you would try to bring him back in the line if he was holding the spot while you peter i did the same thing at the rockies game i was in one line and my sister was in front of me and then i made her move back and then we got the call from ryan so then we gave him but i made her move like four people back i just think you have to be conscious of a line all right honestly if if vicki asked me to move back i would move back but it s because vicky s an incredibly good person okay so put mark it as you ve cut in a line i ve cut a line anyways okay so okay mark it all right cut a line then criticize someone else for cutting on a line rylan no you virtually cut it in line you virtually snuck seven different orders into a A A line i ll do it just for the optics gold on your birthday oh like gotten in a bad mood on your birthday yes i did that my whole entire life oh salt uh i don t anymore and i set myself up for success but mom i had meltdowns every single birthday even if they were giving me like wonderful gifts that i had asked for and threw me huge parties it was like the holiday meltdown i don t know what spoiled brat even christmas everything everything i would have meltdowns for every holiday you and morgan both austin did not do that so you know i had a melted on my th birthday because i had to be around someone i really A A hated oh see and that s another thing like a wedding and everyone forgot my birthday not only did i have to be around someone that i hated who was like super disrespectful and rude to me everybody forgot my birthday well it was yeah the throws of kovid but yes okay but that is a thing like a wedding where if you feel like you re inviting people that you re going to be upset that they re there i think moving forward you just should make sure that somebody you don t want there on your birthday isn t there on your birthday oh i had to go to work with the person oh okay got it i had been trying to get them fired but nobody would listen to me during a friend s birthday this is the worst thing you could do i just have to also clarify this person was stealing money from the company there s a reason why he was supposed to be fired okay because i feel like not only am i going to get torn to pieces about cutting at the tsa line as one person with A A chris who i m trapped okay we re past it the person deserves to be fired moving on okay don t sulk during your friend s birthdays yeah don t go to the birthday i wouldn t do it okay repeated a secret even though you swore you wouldn t definitely have done that before sorry i can t i don t have like a st any of you have a specific in mind that you can share no that s even worse in front of a hundred thousand oh my god said bad things about someone behind their back i mean who hasn t like yeah you can t you do feel bad afterwards though like at least the older i get the more i feel the repercussions of talking behind somebody s back like even if there s no capture of it it s just the shame that you feel inherently from being a nasty A A it gives me the ick myself like i m like why did i do that why did i let myself even if it s like in a safe space it s just like one other person that i know knows i m only venting yeah it s still something i m just like ugh it gives me the ick too and i also can not help but to do it yeah received a message from a friend and felt too lazy to bother replying um i mean yes i always try to get around i m right here staring at you you do it to me on an hourly basis most the time i get back to you uh and when i do i ll i ll react to the messages i ve missed in the best hours absolutely yeah you do okay received a call mom do you um do you not reply to people yes you did the other night i sent you a video of watching your friend s youtube video and no no reply my new puppy was in the frame the the video of your friend was in the frame and i never got a reply no i actually i i m marking that what s going on with your phone because my mom has her read receipts on and half the time it s like your message hasn t been read so what are you doing with like you just have a bunch of unread messages when i m at work i m focused and you guys this was a saturday she was probably working i think you sent it kind of late though yeah i did but like how do you not don t you then have or was i at a party when you open when you open your message or when you open your phone though you see or on your text message it says like five on red like you have the phone that s the problem i get overwhelmed i look at it and i think oh my gosh what do these people want and why your attention just call me just call me i do i face you you don t facetime me mom mom s always like haven t heard from you in a while i m like yeah i m the only one that ever facetimes you that s true you re good at it ryan i know i get overwhelmed and i don t know said the sentence what you ve never seen lizzy every five minutes with tick tock no with normal things in society that everybody s seen do i say that no because you haven t seen anything right okay um what you ve never read i ve never said that honestly i ve never said that either made a joke about someone s physical appearance i don t think too any i mean i m everyone s done this before in regards to something and you d just be a flat out liar if you said you hadn t yeah made a joke at the expense of a friend probably made jokes about someone s death on social media no no that s crazy how many questions is this it s a lot okay we can t be going in depth with each one no we can t okay let s let s scroll through for a while and if you click a yes to one tell us why you re doing it okay i haven t tortured a kitten jesus these are crazy made out with your significant other in public yeah you have yeah i haven t i think when i was dating people i did but now that i m like in a relationship i don t taking a selfie taking a selfie at the beach and taking a couple selfies yes everyone has all done that taking a couple selfie at the beach does that make you an A A no buzzfeed you know what every time i do this i always like find myself being like buzzfeed you sick sons of A A you know who is the A A buzzfeed buzzfeed s the A A i really are the truth about why i quit my job at buzzfeed do you remember those videos yes sent your plate back to the kitchen after having eaten half of it i feel like that s something you would do no i wouldn t eat half of it if i sent it back okay it s inedible if i m sending it you take a bite and then and then realize it s trash and say excuse me sir have you guys put your chewing gum under the table um i can t say i have i don t think i have these are pretty funny hosted a huge party without informing your neighbors guilty i mean called the cops because your neighbors were having a huge party you can t be guilty of that if you just i might have vindictively at a younger age right i would probably go to them first but it s different if you re in an apartment complex because i do feel like there should be some hours that like you know at a certain point you shut the A A up yes if you re in a stand alone house i feel a little bit differently about it you probably know your neighbors well enough to at least say like hey could you just quiet down calling calling the cops is a little too far i wanted to call the cops on your neighbors when i was shooting in your backyard oh yeah well i found out that that was like a a rapper that got a huge deal that has like a bunch of songs on the radio oh wow yeah he was renting that house good for him cause i ran into the guy that owns it a month later and he was like oh yeah they moved out sent text messages during a movie no and i will i swear there s nothing that bothers me more than somebody who brings their A A phone out in a movie the only time i would do that is if it s an empty theater and i know a million percent not one person is behind me even then how dare you oh my gosh how dare you nobody said behind me to the sides of you no no no no i m talking like my peripherals there s no you re clear yes okay they d have to be like in front of me i like these grocery ones paid for groceries entirely and change paid for your groceries while talking on the phone i get so uncomfortable when i m checking out if i m on the phone like well i got ta go now because i can t be that A A who s on the phone while i get checked out but you do it you ve done that to me multiple times and i hang up on you while i m doing it or unless it s a self check my brother is guilty like we d used to go to dairy queen after work and they d be like okay eight dollars and cents and he s like hold on i got the cents in the car and there d be a line and he d be in his car finding his honestly that sounds like awesome it checks out for austin and he s the only one that like you can i mean if you don t know him maybe it wouldn t be like oh it s austin but when you know him you re like oh it s austin he doesn t do it anymore though no he doesn t left all the clothes you didn t want in the fitting room i feel like that s oh i hate when i do it but i ve done it but i feel like i m missing all of these but it i already know them bit in someone s glass made someone cry i m sure i have made your mother cry have i made you cry mom when s the last time just emotional cry like decided to take credit for something that you did not do never okay why would you say that i mean i was just wondering i was curious i actually have a big problem with doing that yeah i do too uh it makes me embarrassed i m ready to hit submit are you guys no you ve done that notice that a friend had something in between his or her teeth and chosen to say nothing sometimes i think she deserves it like sometimes when you re being kind of spicy on the podcast and there s lipstick on your teeth i m like i m gon na let it stay there and then you call it out later made me feel worse which by the way that s that s nasty boy behavior and that made someone cry gone to work while you were sick guilty sometimes you feel like you have to dude no right before the pandemic i got very sick and i had an office job and i was like yo i can t come in i have a fever i m mad sick and they were like can you come in for half the day and i was like i m very sick are you A A kidding and they like bullied me into coming in for a half day where i had to drive somebody around in my car and go into the office and then guess what the whole office got sick let that be a lesson to you homemade simple should i drop the name all right get to it okay mom are you ready to submit yeah all right three two submit oh you are virtually associated they don t know you they don t know you you certainly have your weak moments just like anyone else but generally you are clearly a more superior being buzzfeed see i m even saying this is too far like let s hope that your loved ones appreciate your true value i just started liking you less all right mom mine s not opening oh no why not hers went back to nothing oh go back to safari up at the top no the your top left it says safari it does yeah you read yours i ll help her mine says yes please mine says you are an average A A you allow yourself to stay stray a bit from the code of more i mean we knew it i am an A A i ll admit it but i m like a good A A you know what i mean i m like a bleached A A that s waxed it s cared for nicely yeah perfumed it s every time you move my description gets funnier besides you constantly really reassure yourself by saying and rightfully so that is you oh my gosh there are certainly worse A A out there than you i don t

there s a strawberry unsweetened tea oh no they have a sour patch kid milkshake that milk and sour patch sounds like a bummer well i don t know what it s actually consistent of what was going on on the drive here because i feel like a lot of times we were like we should have been recording oh i was just talking about how i felt like a divorcee like we were going to red lobster but instead we were going to the sonic drive through and my date who i met on tinder has a dui so he couldn t drive so his mom was taking us and your mom was explaining sexual positions to us that she learned on the internet just kidding everybody that has been in the drive through has already passed and got their food and they haven t even said hello to us we should have cut in the line you know what s going on

people have those so you ll have to wait minutes and i thought it was personal i m sure it was perfect this is personal you hate me and that s fine i went to chipotle can you ring the button again mom i don t know am i i am the A A right now i think i think you might be crazy because you have to go to the airport in like two and a half seconds yeah and the show s gon na end well before we do that i think we should talk about three two advice though yes can we get um one of your chili cheese ponies i m sorry what s that the chili cheese coney and then did you want to make that a combo yes we ll get the uh which what is it called ryan oh the sour patch float with the box the slush float with the sour patch kids can we translate grape slushy and also can we get one of the great slushies with nerd candy get that strawberry get the strawberry unsweetened iced tea hey well and then can we get two strawberry unsweetened teas medium thank you do you want something else that s all that s it all righty is going to be once again thank you soon thank you that s a bargain okay what i want to know yeah is why can t we order one off everything the menu like we did at mcdonald s why are we you guys did that yes fake fan where have you been when did you do that it was on new year s two years ago on my main channel yeah i must have seen it it was fun when can we do that vicki next time i m here you and me that was a very hard ordering experience i was gon na say quite frankly i was emotionally exhausted i came here super excited and prepared for like the best it s asking you to to pay i think we have to do it now do it oh here you go here s sorry mom no i was just wondering if you wanted to get out of the car and do it or can you do it through the window i got it i got you leave a tip since we re so hard to work with is it us though are we the drama but you know i it s hard to work in customer service i agree with that and then sometimes i think are they even trying maybe they re not maybe they re having a bad day maybe their boyfriend broke up with them and you know what you re right i am the A A give them give them more than just the tip jesse and i say that give him the whole damn hot dog max out the card mom right before i went to put the card in the screen went away and oh no will it come back you guys keep talking i ll worry about this they have to be able to charge us when they come out right yeah yeah this is all because lizzy wanted to go is that your pitch yeah i told you i had no deal or not can you put them down no lizzy it s hot in here it s rank you need to use what sorry i didn t mean to scream yeah it s loud in these headphones i just spent can you hear your son shaming me well ryan if my pits were smelling i wouldn t honestly they re not rank i just put my face up in there i just don t know if she canceled our order or not i don t think that would be absurd if they canceled the order okay so anyways let s get into some advice though all right mom listen carefully so you can weigh in listen up so my friend moved out for the first time by herself about three months ago the first week of living in the house someone started leaving old dirty shoes on her doorstep this happened about twice a week for a month it then progressed into socks sunscreen hula girl figurines the list goes on over the span of three months all very random and weird we thought little of this until three nights ago they left a piece of paper with i m watching you written on it and an egg and a flower we decided enough is enough and we went to the police and got footage from the supermarket across the road that faces her house turns out it s her two co workers from work who she s only known for six months these girls are and so old enough to know that making a young girl feel like she s being stalked for the last three months is a terrible A A joke the worst part is she spends five days a week with these two and they ve listened to her worry every day about this and never came forward until police were involved super A A weird behavior they are definitely not close enough to be joking around like this and my friend is super pissed off as she s been sleeping with a baseball bat next to her every night for months uh she is super non confrontational and hasn t expressed much to them and they still think it s funny and don t understand the stress this has cost she literally works besides these girls beside these girls five days a week so any advice on how to handle this strange situation would be our food s here oh hi put on my lap if you want to okay the plane won t take off without me i have a huge platform ryan do you have any cash i don t have cash no no we don t have cash none of us have any cash no maybe i ll go to a bank and come i m sorry thank you why wouldn t they you know my beef with a lot of places right now is like starbucks too like all the local coffee shops they allow you to add tips with the card but i feel like it s a big fu to the employees if you re not allowed to tip on the card like don t you think i should be able to tip on my card i don t understand what that s about because nobody s walking around with cash but you want to be able to sit so sonic if you re watching well if you ve even said if you order on the app you can we can t hear you oh it even showed if you order on the app you can tip i took a picture of lizzy s sneaking peeks before oh yeah mom look at this nerd one i don t know if i know the whole story now lizzy i lost focus wait looking for them hold on you re not showing lizzy okay so this one is the sour patch oh my god sour it s really sour yeah girl am i supposed to try it or just show it oh my god there s ice cream in it too yeah that s what i said it s a milkshake it s weird mom the sour patch one is legit oh i love the ice cream in it burger king used to do something like that hold on can you take a video of this is this my straw or how are we doing this yeah just keep your straw okay let s take a video of that so people can see it i took a video i took a video and picture yeah of both okay how is the grape slushy mom i think it s good and i i don t really love great all right pass it back and we ll switch this if you live close to a sonic i m telling you you need to run not walk to the sour patch kid one oh i m gon na love the i don t know how i m feeling about it as she s chugging the whole thing i know my head is freezing let me see about this you re going to get a brain free i got it oh no movie recording stopped card is full oh no of everything i can delete something but i have to break down why A A to get it out do you want to roll on your iphone you got to let my mom try this one i don t know if you ll like it oh is this someone strong oh yeah that s lizzie s straw hair i don t mind drinking from it either no i ll pull it out okay don t get your equipment wet because i dropped my mouth oh my gosh i may want this one okay our card ran out of memory so we re gon na finish on the iphone which might be more of a fun experience anyways did you try the grape slushy with nervous i tried the grape slushie hold on i ll hold that while you take a bite what do you think it is sour these are so fun for summer drinks hot dog i don t think i ve ever had such fun summer drinks though like even if i like it it s too sour for you no i like it it s it s really sour but i do like it really you think it s too sour did you get some of the ice cream though yes if you plug your straw into the ice cream that s really the way to get it it cuts the shower holy A A and the flavor s phenomenal how s that you oh you don t like it you want some more no i like it it s good here i do want to try one more bite wow or not bite but this hot dog do be hidden wow i love that it s sour and the sour patch kids they have chopped up so you get little and it s already gummy you get chewy gummy bites inside of the ice cream and slushie i love when you talk about drive through food because you make it sound so exquisite it is this is a work of art i m not handing out ten out of tens like it s nothing you did a review of chicken nuggets one time where you re like the different the different flavors mixing together on my palate he s talking about chicken nuggets you can have more you got more of the grape one too is the strawberry unsweetened tea good this is probably the healthy option oh it tastes like strawberry mm hmm can i have a bite of the other half that you haven t bit on did they form and hold it i have real strawberries to that it tastes like maybe but no um it s a good hot dog dude a hot dog has never tasted so good i m all of a sudden in love with some oh my gosh oh you didn t even want to come you re right this was the we should have ditched the other restaurant and come straight to sonic honestly but the last time i went to sonic it was kind of a flop are we going to give this young woman advice yeah call the A A police get those A A fired there s no get those A A fired for sure that is some psychotic A A behavior that s when we don t A A with cats A A and if you re non confrontational it s time to become confrontational stand up for yourself you deserve it because you should not be living in fear of your life for existing like this is the craziest thing i have ever heard it s A A weird and these two must be sociopaths to listen to you talk about your fear of being stalked and to laugh and to continue to do so and take it further and to say they re watching you i have a personal mission to come after these women for you as the biggest A A in the car i would never even do that that is next level crazy and for a first time pers like moving out on your own at and these women are like plus get a life you have horrible karma coming to you these other two women that are producing this and i just think girl hold your head up high you made it through and thank god that you lived across from a store that had a security camera running also don t be afraid to look these women in the eyes and say that s really A A weird it s really A A weird that you did that it s not funny it s A A weird it s so crazy i know i m laughing but it s not because the situation is funny it s because it s so insane like why are they serious like they they weren t gon na kill her but like what it s such an odd choice of something to do like i will never comprehend i was just looking for my phone i will never comprehend why somebody chooses to do something that sick and twisted i don t even like a prank call that s too nefarious and they had left photos here i m waiting for you putting watches or i m watching you with like weird eggs dirty sneakers also how many pairs of sneakers do these A A have this is crazy that they can just leave sneakers willy nilly all over doorsteps and A A and if you re not confrontational you need to take next steps in figuring out how to deal with this because it s not okay and you can t let these girls behave like that don t get wrapped up in your own vendetta though like let it go and know that they re the A A weird ones and it s okay for you to tell them they re A A weird and it s really okay for you to go to your boss and tell them how A A weird it is that they did this A A because it s super funky and normally i m not like a go tattletail kind of person no but this is weird this is weird and the fact that it s unpredictable behavior which also makes me very uncomfortable and it seems as though like it started from the workplace which is why i think it s appropriate like they listen to her freak out day after day at work i m so sorry this happened to you and my advice isn t great but thank you for sharing your story thank you for sharing the pictures and rat on them hoes sorry mom wasn t really uh my my mom was dealing with paying for our food can you imagine if vicki s like well i ve done that no i m just thinking karma exists and they will they ll get their karma yeah you can sleep easy knowing that they re gon na have to sit next to my stinky ass on an airplane one day oh gosh oh i feel bad for because speaking of airflow you re crazy i just nuzzled my snoop deep in my pit it s we have to call you an uber you re on my phone if you miss your flight elizabeth what are they gon na do they re

Music so Music we re coming to you live we re starting beef with shane dawson you heard it here first folks well yeah i m pissed why are you pissed well because you just told me that you had sent shane a message and he exclamation pointed it with no other context that s a full blown blow off and when i did that the other night i was responding to his mom and i was just gon na do a heart and leave it at that yeah he goes that is crazy like no it is that is like insane behavior like only awful people only do the that s what i m saying it s it s insanely dismissive well this is crazy because he literally got mad at me for doing that and so he knows yeah so he knows the power he knows the weight behind the action and while we re mad at shane don t if you want to come for me you better do it off air A A no i m just saying i i m being set up no i m still on my shane rage you re okay okay sorry sorry i m still on my chain rage yeah keep going with your chain race i m literally being set up to like he s setting me up go on well every morning i wake up and i m always like you know cleaning the kitchen picking up after the night and whatever that man has left out for me to pick up the lid is never screwed oh it could be anything joe does the same A A thing and you pick it up from the lid and it just drops and it s A A everywhere yeah joe does that A A and he acts like he doesn t and it s A A wild he ll do it with pill bottles i ll be like bro just put the pill bottle on the top because i pick it up from the i pick it up and you wouldn t think that there s that there s a psychopath in my house it s just not screwing A A in and i confronted him about it and he was like no i don t know you have the gas line and i was like they gaslight because they can t be the ones not screwing it in you re going to lose your privilege of me picking up the kitchen because i m going to leave it for you to do it to yourself because it s so infuriating and you wouldn t think that there s that many scenarios in which there could be something with a lid unscrewed but there s a lot you ve never lived in our house if you don t know um i have plans for retribution my friend shannon does this really A A up thing where when her fiance does something wrong or that she doesn t like she will lightly unplug his like A A while it s charging so it looks like it s still plugged in but when he goes to find it the next day there s no charge and he doesn t think to plug it back in because you just leave it lightly sitting in the socket so if you lightly sit in the socket his cell phone charger and his like laptop charger and anything else that he needs charged he will learn a A A lesson so here s what you need to do ladies you need to unplug his A A if he s not screwing lids on you need to unplug his A A but that further makes my life a nightmare what if i need to contact him and his phone s dead it s cute that you think you ever leave your own house what if you need to walk across the house to contact him most of the time he s the one that s ordering me food so i will give him that you know like i ll i pick up the sprinkles that fly all over the kitchen but he s got a sprinkle catastrophe he does keep yes damn that s a knife you know you have halo top you add a little bit of sprinkles and that s what i m saying he really has something out for me and when i confront him he acts like nothing had ever happened and he doesn t do this and he hasn t been doing it for the six years we ve been dating i love you shane yeah i love you too shane but like explain what s happening in denver and screw the A A lids on here s the deal are you also an ice cream and sprinkle sprinkles girly well n not normally but on an occasion because shane is a sprinkles boy like he loves sprinkles but i really only will add them on top if they re the really soft ones the crunchy ones yeah i m not a huge fan but i also have started having my ice cream exclusively with whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles so yesterday was easter for us it was exhausted i m exhausted i did all the cooking and you know what lizzy is always on me about like oh you should cook more you should do more things around the house and uh the one time i like muster up the courage to cook i send lizzy a photo like so proud like i had cut this butternut squash like you wouldn t believe like i am gordon ramsay and i sent her a because all gordon ramsay does is chop a squash hey you know what he sends me this picture and it s like literally just chopped squash behind was chicken and hamburgers that i also barbecued and we did you season them uh no yeah so like you re not that s this was my point you know what i mean like you re you re serving a seasonless grilled chicken it was delicious did you put salt on it i don t i hate garlic more than anything so stay away from me with that right but garlic s not the only seasoning i did to season my butternut squash what d you put on it olive oil pepper salt that s it but she was like he s gordon ramsay now guys watch out no but i mean like i i put in the effort and i thought if anyone would be proud it would be lizzy and all i get back is like i don t know i can t taste it so and i was like well the reason why i said that is because i just saw some chopped squash on a baking sheet and to me well yes it is difficult to chop a squash because i have tried and those are some hard A A i started screaming at everyone i was like i don t know if this is right like i don t know if this is no they re they re really hard and like and that s why i thought i was like is it like an avocado where it s too ripe and i like it s not gon na be good yeah and shane goes i don t know don t ask me and then every all the other women in the house they were like no it s fine you re fine squashes are like hard as A A unless it s like summer squash that s what i m saying it was a big job to cut that squash and i got compliments on how there was no skin showing like it was all did anybody eat it squash everyone ate it do you like squash i love squash i think squash is so yucky really oh so that so that s your true that s the other part it digs deeper for you i think squash kind of has like the aftertaste of like a bathroom like it s like a potty what did you guys do for easter what didn t we do for easter that s the question no we just i see you re still in your easter outfit yeah this is the we re out of clothes look um and i don t think we re gon na be getting new clothes it feels like it s serving easter church sunday yeah like literally when i was leaving the house i was like it s serving modern housewife it s serving like a mormon librarian meeting your your boyfriend s parents at church sure but it s also a little risque because you can see my bra on my skin right i see that um did you cook for the men in your life i did i made breakfast i made a hash brown casserole i made some eggs i made some rolls with cheese in them yeah i made some sausage i made some bacon i made some fruit salad i made some lemon bars i hard boiled a bunch of white eggs so that we could dye them and make them glittery we did that too i broke every egg so we didn t do it wow my hard boiled eggs were perfect theresa shane s mom was the one that helped me guided me through it because last time i tried to make hard boiled eggs that didn t work either why didn t it work i thought you brought it to a boil and then you turned off the burner so you made a soft boiled egg yes they were all like not edible yeah wow and then i tried putting it back in the foil it was a whole fiasco but you know go ahead and hit that yellow button for your summer squash oh you re a chef girl rylan adams gordon ramsay look out A A and then chris oh chris you don t have your head set on what as he gets prepared he s back ladies oh my gosh his mic s not plugged in the world didn t want any of you chris i m worried if you plug that in right now i m worried it s gon na mess up the recorder don t you dare here we ll talk to you in the second half love you guys we break down and reset up we ll check in i unplugged his mic last week because like he s not here his mic is gone this is what you get no mike this is your punishment chris well we probably just never plugged it in from the week before whatever lizzie no i like it i like it we re aggressive so lizzy and i have been going back and forth on having fomo and not fomo from coachella like literally i lost my phone i no longer give a A A oh now you just want to go no now i don t give a A A so you ha you found your phone oh no i got rid of my fomo i have no more fear of missing out it seems awful i do kind of want to go camping well judging by our text thread throughout the weekend you couldn t tell if like we were the most jealous angry people in the world that we weren t at coachella and then two seconds later we were like oh my gosh coachella s trash we could never go there yeah i think i landed on coachella s trash and i could never go there like i m trying to think of like all the things like i m not made for and one of the things is like the sun and a massive binge drinking environment like that is not for this girly not for this church girly the nightmare for me is that like everyone spends hours getting ready hours taking photos hours editing their photos but that s not we re not those kind of girls like we re not i don t think you and i would go in any sort of like fashion fashion you know what i mean like absolutely not i kind of like died when i realized that every pedestrian person there spent like to on a look that s like a shitty jean skirt with a bathing suit top or like some weird doily wrapped around their nipples and i m just like girl that is not the move like ass cheeks out like please no put your ass cheeks back like what the A A is this what is this culture regard anyways and then you see the haley bieber s coming in and their A A jeans and their regular t shirts and i m just like see that s the girl i am like i m not trying to put on some weird and that s what i ve been telling you all along with fashion like the realtors in la also will always be like oh it s always the people that are dressed like they ve just rolled out of bed that are the ones that are actually buying the house yeah so i just feel like with fashion it s like do whatever you re comfortable in exactly it sounds like my nightmare well that s what i was trying to explain to you on your vlog when you put that sweater on with those slacks because i was like it s giving i m too rich to give a A A about your vibe okay but then why can t i just wear whatever i want to wear you totally can t it s just like the patagonia moment was just like that s different if we lived in the bay area it would have been over i m from colorado that s not the bay area okay and also colorado like whatever okay we re past it but then so like i i enjoyed watching the people that i wanted to see at coachella from the comfort of my own home with angles right up where i wanted them and then when it zooms out and you see the crowd like i took a picture of the crowd and i sent it to lizzie and i was like i don t think i m missing anything and you have to walk miles to get even into the facility where you can then walk further to a stage to see somebody perform that you re not actually going to see perform and it screams to me that you have to be blackout drunk yeah so for me my fomo is i only want to go if i m kylie jenner and treat it as such like that s what i want kylie jenner coachella experience and i think that s what everyone envisions their coachella experience will be i honestly thought you could provide me with that experience i don t know when i was looking at all of them i was like wow they re on a different planet like when you see kris jenner s easter spread it s like so much also i think about how sick those kids must feel after all that candy because i had two lemon bars on sunday and i was like oh she s going to bed this is too much for my black out with sugar yesterday i felt sick i had a A A headache i had to lay down i was like oh no yeah she blamed her rage on me on sugar she said sorry i m raging with sugar oh i literally don t remember whatever you re talking about like i blacked that out what happened i will say shane did spoil me he did chris jenner me so what did he do and also what did i do to you what did i scream at you just rooted ease oh oh was it about your cooking yes yeah okay yeah we ve already been over there now i remember Music what did he get you chocolate stuffs and he s like i got i got home and he had set up like the most a kris jenner spread i posted on my instagram stories like oh shane jenner spoils me so much because like it is just so funny that he he goes all out so once we re dad s it s gon na be so cute because you know he s just gon na deck the halls yeah gon na be kris jenner all over the place maybe my kids want to come over freestyle too maybe no honestly i would love to set up like easter egg hunts like did you do that as a kid where you hide the eggs all over the world i wanted to do that with joe and james but they re like we re and i was just like A A you jelly s been eating a lot of eggs oh you re feeding her the hard boiled eggs i shouldn t be but i she did get a hard boiled egg they only live once they re supposed to have like closer to raw eggs my dad uh cooks an egg for his dogs every morning yeah i used to like bubs knows eggs in english and spanish huevos and gets real excited like he knows he can t have either right now because he s on a very strict diet poor little guy the vet keeps calling him overweight it s okay i hate when they do that i hate when the internet does that too can we call him chubbas we went to the vet this week to get him because he s got allergy issues so we re trying to resolve those and i was told that he needed to lose four pounds so he s been on a very strict diet and we go in and it s like i walk him and he pooped twice i was like you re gon na be a skinny legend like you got this baby so like the weigh in comes and i m like get ready because this dog s snatched it s about to be a hot boy s summer and the butt comes in and she goes so he s fatter and i went shut up and she said no and i was like are you sure it s not muscle mass that he s gained and she was like yes and i was like damn well all right do you have to keep writing obese on his paperwork because it s like he s starting to affect him negatively like i honestly think they understand like yeah if i ve ever made a plus size comment towards honey she like looks at me and then like jumps away yeah i called her a skinny legend this morning in the bathroom she liked it i m telling you yeah she perked up so now bubs is on a extreme exercise regiment but he keeps like laying down like A A this is not it for me and what are him and joe doing i see there s something going on there oh so bubs and joe both sleep talk oh what a nightmare for you yeah and jelly snores so it s like jelly snores joe snores bubs is attacking something in his dreams oh yeah cause he s always like wow and then does he kick his legs that kicks you yeah and sometimes he goes and last night while he was barking like that like sleep barking joe would respond to it and joe s sleep talk is like really weird bland officey talk like he s like yeah we ll circle back to them okay okay it s like the most it s the weirdest A A because joe s like worm brains like i don t know why those are his dreams but they like you should take advantage and really get whatever information you need from him while that s what i m saying like it s just like in an office no information is ever provided have you ever tried having a conversation with him no but he and bob so bubs last night would go and then joe would be like oh okay and then just gibberish and then bubs would say something and joe would be like you need to record this for bubs to talk yeah i should i thought about that s the first time i ve actually thought about grabbing my phone but it s like in the moment usually i m scared because joe s also a sleep screamer as i m pretty sure we ve discussed so like when it is the benign like oh yeah all right i ll get back to you on that like whatever the A A it s it s weird it s weird and they were both having like an exchange nocturnally i don t know well shane had told me and it freaked me out because we were talking about the multiverse and parallel universes yet you don t want to go see everything everywhere all at once with me i don t know it seems too cool for me you re talking about multiverses right now okay well i don t know you liked spencer okay i loved spencer yeah i think you could do another artsy movie okay well i m free for a while let s go okay let s go i m brizzy um sorry wait really yeah i asked you last week for a reason girl no okay yeah but so shane told me that he has he has like a dream a recurring dream world like he s been going to the same house in his dream since he was in middle school and as long as he can remember and there s always a story line he can like it just freaks me out because i don t have anything of the sort like there s no consistency i don t have another life when i go to bed and he s saying he has like a whole world that he re enters when he goes to sleep i mean i have recurring dreams too like since i was like four well reoccurring i think is different than like a world in which you live yeah i mean let me pick my nose about it really quick i i i wonder i wonder more about that like i d want to talk to shane more about like what that means for him like is he going to his what s that A A video game you guys play animal crossing yeah is he like is it like an animal crossing type of world that he s traveling to or like well let s get more information yeah i need more information before i m like moved by the notion because i have a reoccurring dream that i m being like attacked by dinosaurs and like it s a san francisco landscape and it s like yeah it s the same house that i m hiding in and running away to and all those things but it s like i don t think it means anything other than that has always terrified me and it s more about the notion of people not believing me right when i m scared and trying to warn someone of something so like yours is real trauma yeah i ve been Laughter i ve been having like anxiety ridden dreams and i m not i m not anxious right now in my real life yeah when i go to bed like it s like chaotic it s chaos it s crazy it s embarrassing situations like what you know those bright pink pants i got in palm springs i was i like woke up in uh in an orange theory class in my pink pants oh what everyone s nice and that s one of the more tame ones but i m playing with the curious you are ever gon na meet or like can you imagine the trauma oh your trauma is real listen to mine i didn t say mine was pants in an orange theory class A A i didn t say mine was trauma i said mine was anxiety written for me i was starring in a play and i couldn t remember my lines i had like an i award it was wild Laughter i just i just started making up lines and hoping the cast could react i love that it was awful yeah i m so sorry okay well if we want to get to our test today the test that we had promised i think we should jump right into ice tea which is our kardashian review okay that s what we re picking up okay all right i think you should start um you have your tristan note i m just scared because you have this note with multiple exclamation points yeah i can t forget to read the ads but we ll do that in a second okay so we saw the kardashians yeah the kardashians like everyone did and we have the same take as everybody else i don t know if that s true well what are your takes are they original my take is that i guess i haven t watched the kardashians but like i love the kardashians and so picking up into this new season i think for me the reality show of their life not as a reality show is much more mysterious enticing and intriguing to me like watching them all via instagram and headlines is a lot more intriguing than seeing the reality of it playing out with them just eating their catered fried chicken being like whoa so i mean i kind of disagree with you i thought so like that moment the tristan moment that you were talking about earlier is when kim and saint find the the new uh the new alleged sex tapes and me seemed so fake like i think they were trying to recreate the moment and why was it on a kid s game i don t think it s a kid s game i think roblex or whatever is a game that a lot of people play and the kim kardashian sex tape ad pops up everywhere all the time oh okay i thought i didn t know i ve never heard of roblox but the interesting thing of it that i find funny and that tick tock has now picked up on also is when you see kim go chloe can you take a look at this tristan goes was that like po he s a A A caught and this is before the second baby drama dropped so it s like that A A is harboring so many secrets and then later in the episode that piece of A A is like i just want you back and it s like what are you where do you get off on doing that i feel the most embarrassed for chloe because she no hold on let me talk okay she she is trying so hard to get the audience to forgive him so that she can forgive him and be with him publicly like she s really setting the scene like we re going to therapy and he s just a bad actor like he s not good at it and it s like she s i think she wants the best for her family which every person would want that and this is prior to another scandal emerging with him and another woman but she s just giving it her all to like have the audience be like maybe he isn t the worst and it s like oh to now know the reality which is like he s the worst if i were her i would not be embarrassed because of everything you said before that it is such an admirable A A battle to wage through on her part for her kids and for her family to want to with every fiber of her being believe that this man who she trusted with her love her life her body and her A A soul outside her body which is true dwarf i m saying this situation no i know and i m still and i m saying i think we need to stop as a society we need to stop placing embarrassment on people who get cheated on and put it on the A A cheater who s a piece of A A who the entire world was here to A A give a second chance to with for this woman who literally went through labor and had a A A baby with you you re going to see so many people no i m just saying like i don t be embarrassed chloe he should be A A embarrassed because his actions are deplorable he s a A A embarrassing A A the problem is it causes embarrassment like it doesn t no i know and i m saying i agree with that social media really builds that up to make and i know she feels it because she is messed with by the outside world s opinions on her we all know that and it is like i agree with you it s awful and it s horrible but it s just embarrassing that he keeps putting her in this situation like he s allowing this to happen he s allowing to sit down on camera on a reality show knowing what he had done to her and just like trying to yeah i mean the situation is embarrassing i stand by he should be embarrassed and she should not be because i don t think i m saying the situation s embarrassing i m not saying she needs to be embarrassed right no i m and i m saying explicitly she shouldn t be embarrassed because so much of the narrative is oh how embarrassing for chloe if i had a kid with somebody i would try anything and everything to make it work yeah if i like if i still had interest in the person whether that be co parenting or a loving relationship i would do what chloe is doing exactly yeah absolutely so chloe you A A hold your head high girl you re hot as A A A A go get em tiger um i felt very comforted in the fact that courtney can t keep her grass green either like i thought this was just like it wasn t dot it wasn t dead but it just wasn t like perfectly lusciously green like i envisioned kim s to be and i just felt like with uh unlimited access to gardeners and landscapers i would just think their grass would be velvety green at all times because i really beat myself up if my grass isn t green because it s a it s a labor of love to maintain was this a plot point of the show or did you just notice her grass isn t very good no this is all me okay and i m saying it makes me feel comforted that celebrities of this caliber and this uh money making machine uh also have they they have a hard time keeping their grass green too it just makes me feel good yeah i would say that s a unique take on the premiere of the show that s all that happened i mean i i enjoy it and i m gon na keep watching it but i just think like everything that was in the show could have been edited down to minutes and then it would have been maybe a little more like bamboo yeah and i guess maybe the allure is just their setting which is just like right incredible and it s just like they re so rich and you re like wow every meal is catered so like is that the allure um i think yeah it s a little bit like lifestyles of the rich and famous but you get to be like in on it with them um to some degree i also thought it was A A hilarious how kim was like a girl from will and grace talked some A A like to diminish deborah messing from the grace of will and grace to just a girl from was the most savage cut of all like that was the slap i don t even know if that was an intentional thing like that s how i would have done it because i wouldn t have i ve never seen will and grace you wouldn t have said the girl from will and grace the mr all of the sudden well i ve never seen the show so i don t know i m just saying you do know that deborah mason is the lead character in it um i i know really i ve never seen will and grace i mean but you ve seen deborah messing s face i know more of the guy because he s like on in the podcast world and he s everywhere jack wait what s his name well his name is not actually jack i m forgetting what his actual name is right see i can t remember his name i don t know either of those guys names okay one s name as well and the other topics have us fighting no i live for the kardashians i like them a lot i just thought it could have been cut together a little more snappy but that s just my own personal preference yeah i mean there s also been like just recently this is unrelated to the actual airing of the show but back to you talking about like how their instagram drama is a little bit more titillating apparently mason has a secret account that like people are following that s private and on his stories he posts the hottest tee and it might be very real like literally last night i was on tick tock and i just saw a bunch of these things where it s like mason s like here s every plot line from the show this season and then he s taking screen grabs of kylie dming him saying mason stop this is not cool he literally released a photo picture of kylie s baby her son with his name revealed as night something webster and all this A A where kylie s just like A A stop like i m in a meeting right now i can t like this is not cool this is not cool mason stop stop stop and he posted all of that on the stories and like some people that follow it are like screen grabbing it and posting it and he s like here s every story line from season one of the new show apparently kendall s engaged and like a bunch of shit s going on in it like kim s helping people that s something that s what i mean is i feel like for the premiere episode on a new network with how much craziness goes on in their worlds it could have jumped right to it like yeah that s what i mean is it s underwhelming in the sense that like there s no lack of storyline there and i i just kendall being out of focus was bizarre was out of focus what the A A the gender girls just don t give a A A they don t give up apparently they re splitting the paycheck equally and it s like good for them who s showing up to do the work anyways they re like they re like the cliffhanger at the end of every episode like will they or will they show up next week and are they going to utter a syllable stay tuned no like kylie showed up but like she didn t say anything so the shot they got of her was like her playing with her nails the dinner table and i m like that s what we re paying kylie for and i love it yeah i mean good for them i think nothing i wish nothing but success to that family they ve done this show nobody has to wear success you re right okay um do you want to hit on your last chloe kardashian thing yeah i just think it s A A wild that khloe kardashian admitted to photoshopping true remember that whole scandal like true but i ve never scandal where chicago is pictured at disneyland with true but the photos are very clearly photoshopped images of true so and it s like in my heart i was like why would they do that i m still wondering why the A A would they do that and A A chloe posted like true s first time at disney world like today or not today but like apparently it was kylie s baby and then at the time yeah and they put true s face over yeah because everything was going on with travis and they didn t want backlash about that oh the after astro world the problem went to disneyland the thing is just then yeah that s the photo like why why photoshop it s like is posting a photoshopped image of your kids at disneyland so important that it s like chloe had her sister s back and that s what that was i guess so but that s a pretty selfless act of love why why do stock is just rising for me but why like why not just hold the photo like why do you have to post the photo yeah you don t have to post the photo but i do think it s sweet that chloe swooped in with the trusseldorf save or maybe other people saw them there and kylie wanted like a cover story so for cover fire they re like no that wasn t stormy that was true i love them all honest to god kidding can we be them today s episode

goodbye okay so we wanted to before before we get into our like they re starting to sound more and more like we re like holding christmas in hostage somewhere it s like let the let the audience know you re not being tickled behind camera chris i want to know i they were concerned for him last week so i just wanted him to be able to say something but he had nothing to say do you have any stories for us chris did you get crumble cookies this week no i m sad about it crumble how about crumble discontinuing our fave dude we should talk about that what the A A crumble the classic pink sugar sugar cookie like was that an april fool s joke that we just saw too late i don t know because we are pretty out of the they ve lost you call the number no wait number there s a like hotline there s like a grief number no they did not oh so but why would they do that why would they discontinue that like they ve lost and then they just and then they A A with our emotions saying we can call and like place a complaint and then they just play in the arms of the angels you know i feel slighted i ve promoted them so much yeah eat a A A dick crumble you re cooking yeah but whatever i m actually devastated about it honestly i ate a crumble cookie one time and had a bad day so i don t know if the two are related but i do know that both happened at the same time and if you just so happen to bring back your chilled pink sugar cookie without tormenting us for too long like if you make the choice this week we ll take everything we just said get rid of that chocolate chip cookie nobody wants that A A chocolate grandma s rice get the A A out of here how about their chocolate chips they need a revision on their chocolate chips they A A suck figure that out instead of getting rid of the sugar cookie you sick A A all right today we re doing therapy with the stars because for some reason lizzie did back to back to back stories that all had to do with uh celebrities going to therapy and talking about it yeah so we re going to do this quickly because we got to jump into are we the narcissist first up nick and vanessa lachey said they used to go through each other s phones but therapy helped them stop if the therapist said if y all are going through each other s phones then you shouldn t be together thoughts um i agree with that i can t like i don t know what kind of previous trauma i m i m guessing that it comes from having a previous relationship gone bad where somebody had cheated on you and you feel so compelled to do that but i think if like a if you got caught going through your significant other s phone that like if i caught shane like behind my back looking through my phone i would think he s lost trust in me which would then start a divide in our relationship um i agree with that and i also feel like there can be i like like i ve gone through joe s phone aggressively and he s gone through my phone aggressively and i don t like when i was looking through it i was looking for through it for evidence of a proposal like that was that which is not cool but it s like i m also going to look for presents around the house all the A A time that s me that s who i am you know what i mean but it s also like i m never living my life on my phone or in real life doing A A that makes me that i feel like i have to keep from him and if you are then you re probably not in a place in your life to be in a long term relationship exactly like that yeah i so yes i think if you re looking through your partner s phone it s uh it should be a wake up call that it s probably not the right relationship or you re not ready to be settled down yeah even if you re not finding anything in the person s phone ask yourself why you re looking and then and resolve that issue kaylee cuoco flight attendant comes back this week i m so excited i did not see that going to a season two it felt like a mini series continuing really oh i loved it oh i loved it too but i didn t i felt like there was a story that had been told right we ll see where they go this season uh kaylee cuoco admits that she s in therapy to forgive herself for her mistakes you added this i don t know where it s really going oh i think uh you know life is long and nobody has a clean slate failure is going to happen you are going to fail yourself you re going to feel as though you ve failed other people s you re going to fail at reaching goals and you can not allow that to be something that stops you in your track because as i said life is long and those are learning opportunities and we re not our worst moments and when something does go wrong or you do make a mistake those are like you said the most pivotal points to be able to look back on and make a change like sometimes it takes doing something out of the norm or the isn t right to be able to make a correction yeah it takes an electric shock sometimes to realize like oh that wasn t the right choice she s also i forget what magazine it is she s covering but she in the story this is she just got divorced for the second time this past year and she was like i m never getting married again and you can put that on the cover i m sure she had good prenups because she s got a lot of money to protect that big bank but um so i m sure she had good prenups it s probably just the whole division of everything and the legal terms and she s probably just like if i m in love with you we can just happily be in love yeah i think so much of marriage gets contrived and contorted by the legal system and the government contract making a contract about it i think that there can be spiritual and soulful contracts in place that are more valuable than that of the government well in marriage i mean getting married is a contract yeah you know and i think that s set in place because you do get through maybe moments of your life with your partner that maybe you wouldn t if you weren t married yeah so i think to some degree like marriage does help in that regard but it s also like you said it could be toxic i i m not talking about like not being married i for me marriage is identified and symbolized the contract for me was signed when i put the ring on my finger and so like all jokes i m sorry i ll joke sometimes like do i want to win this fight and give my ring back or do i want to keep this beautiful A A heirloom on this beautiful A A finger and the answer is i want to keep this A A ring on this A A finger and that s what i mean so we re going to figure it out sometimes you d have a fight no matter what it may be about that like how d you not have that ring on your finger you might run out and who knows where you do i might go stay at rylands for the night you never know um and then finally viola davis uh is saying forgiveness is not just for the person apologizing or not apologizing and i guess this is speaking on her choosing to forgive her dad uh after years of abuse as a child yeah and i think that i added the part it s not just for the person apologizing or not apologizing so that s lizzy yeah so it s like forgiveness isn t just for the person that s asking for it because sometimes they re never asking for it but for me because i ve been in some instances where i have been um an unequal participant in an abusive situation and and when i say that i mean my only involvement in the situation was that i was there and that i stayed for it too long and i think that it s really easy to be overwhelmed with resentment and anger towards an abuser to the point that it consumes your life and even when you re out of the situation you are still controlled by that person by harboring your resentment so for me forgiveness means i m going to forgive myself for staying too long and i m going to move on from the scenario and rem and remove that resentment from my life so that i no longer have to carry that burden as i walk forward yeah even when i was getting sued by the company that i left before i was doing youtube on my own it was so traumatic for me at that time i didn t have money to like be to get sued and handle the legal fees and i carried so much anger for so long because they not only robbed me from a lot of money but it was just so traumatic and i realized like holding that anger it was doing nothing for me as soon as i like released the anger and released like the negative connotation in my brain of what that meant i felt free like i like the burden was gone and i was able to just move forward with my life and i think like for a lot of things like i can t speak on viola s relationship with her dad yeah i think with a lot of relationships like if it s a if it s a family member it is almost in some scenarios if you want to have them in your life or if you want to be of peace with someone and they re not harming you actively now you almost have to like start a new relationship with them like new boundaries new understandings yes let s come together and build a relationship as day one to move forward and heal yeah yeah exactly i like treat yourself as the person who deserves how you want to be treated right not as anything less than that ever sorry my phone s blowing up putting it on work mode and with all of that uh we will take well you got to be on your phone right now transitioning to something more self centered so ryland think uh ryland and a lot of people think that it s a problem that i self identify as the narcissist well the more that you like will take pride in saying that you re a narcissist because and here s the thing like uh nars like if you are a narcissist it was built upon traumas and behaviors so it is like it s sad that it has a negative connotation because it s based and rooted upon traumatic events but some of the coping mechanisms or the narcissistic personality traits that develop in spite of those or despite of those are very negative so sometimes when you re like well i m a narcissist so whatever right like it s almost just like well i don t know if you are a narcissist i think that you know just like anything there s a spectrum and a range for narcissism i think the fact that i can relate time other people s life events to myself all like of the time that s pretty narcissistic well i think a lot of people have narcissistic characteristics or person or traits narcissistic traits yeah and i think that like you ve said before my awareness of it is a checks and balance system and i work very hard to not allow my narcissism to hurt or placate other people and i will say that as a person who s like hedonistically self serving it does not serve myself for those i love and interact with to be in pain or discomfort so you re a self if you are you re self actualized or self realized as they would say yeah but i also don t think that it s in my like it s not part of my desire for other people to suffer well like i don t get off on other people s pain and i get off on other people s joy and excitement and pleasure so that s something that i actively seek out like i heard dr drew and we re taking dr drew s are you in or how narcissistic are you test but he was saying there s a difference between like jealousy and and or like i think it was jealousy and envy and jealousy is like oh i m jealous of this person envy is oh i m jealous of that person but i m going to do i m going to go out of my way to take that person down yeah and those are like very distinct differences and that could also be like the difference between like narcissistic and sociopathism i i don t know i m also not a therapist so let s just take this quiz and see where it leads us and nothing we say is a professional take don t take medical or therapy don t take any A A advice from us jesus christ we don t even know how chickens are born no oh my gosh how embarrassing for us uh so the first question is i have a natural talent for influencing people or i am so it s i have a natural talent for influencing people or i am not good at influencing people we re influencers we influence society every A A wednesday we show up and we tell you A A i don t know because like i don t think i m ever projecting we have a segment called advice though okay money doesn t become oh modesty doesn t become me i am essentially a modest person i don t think i get it modesty doesn t work for me intelligent enough for this quiz i am essentially i don t think i get it modesty doesn t become me it s like you re not down with modesty you re like my dick is big and that s okay or i am essentially a modest person like i may be packing a huge dick but i don t need you to know it i don t know i feel like we re kind of in the middle of this like i would say i m essentially a modest person it s very few things that i m like so proud about that i m going to scream at the rooftops about and how do i not had i not have a platform like a podcast where like yeah it is driven off of stories from our personal life yeah i don t think so i mean i would say for me modesty doesn t become me but i m also very self deprecating so i don t know what to do you have to make a choice what would you say about me i go on press tours you would say i m not very modest i just don t get how it s phrased but i think i m just stupid do you think i m modest yes or no um see what i mean it s kind of hard because like i think if you were like i think if you were jennifer lawrence you wouldn t be modest really like i think if you were an a list movie star you wouldn t be mine no i think i d be more modest if i was an endless movie star because i d be like it speaks for itself A A you know what i mean right i think that alone says i m not modest okay okay modesty doesn t become her okay i would do almost anything on a dare i tend to be fair a fairly cautious person i m going to say fairly cautious i m fairly cautious there s not many like you couldn t pay me to be a jackass i mean i wouldn t even smell the sentry egg okay you read the next when people commit uh compliment me i sometimes get embarrassed i know that i am good because everybody keeps telling me so i get embarrassed yeah me too the thought of ruling the world frightens the hell out of me if i ruled the world it would be a better place honestly it s not a lie when i say it would be a better place there s no uh no it frightens the hell out of me there s no world in which it frightens the hell out of me but also i want what s best for everybody and it s not a selfish choice it s with a heavy head that i wear the crown are you taking this quiz too okay good uh that s he s talking to chris yes i can usually talk my way out of anything i try to accept the consequences of my behavior okay so here s what like this is another double sided coin for me because like i can talk my way out of most things and i m a person who s like i ll take a consequence in what scenarios i mean i m talking about like i can usually talk my way out of anything like i never got a single ticket or charge pressed against me and i ve spent the night in jail multiple times right and i think if somebody s where i m at right now if somebody s telling me something has affected them or if i ve done something wrong i really try to take it in i m gon na say i can accept a consequence you just explained how you re the off but i also pay my taxes okay which feels like a consequence of living okay be honest be brutally honest i am being brutally honest like i can talk my way out of anything and i can accept a consequence i A A walked around la for A A nine months because i didn t have a driver s license okay i prefer to blend in with the crowd i like to be the center of attention um potentially shocking i prefer to blend into the crowd i don t like personal like that s why i don t want to have a wedding like yeah the attention sounds hellish to me i have severe social anxiety and again you re not going to believe me but i prefer to blend into the crowd as well okay um i will be a success i am not too much concerned about success i mean i do want to be a success like and in whatever regard that means successful is to me like i want to have a successful family i do want to successfully provide for my family you know yeah so i am no better or worse than most people i think i m a special person see i think i m pretty average with a good work ethic i agree with that for myself no i think you think you re no no no no no no you have to put i m a special person because you think i m special i will not accept otherwise i think i m special it s weird because this quiz also it almost tells you like you re bad no you re inserting it puts yellow when you re bad but like honestly on air for everyone in god to hear do you think i m a special person i do do you mean that yeah i do suck cut to me being like get the lie detector test in here okay i m not sure if i would make a good leader i see myself as a good leader i m definitely not sure if i see myself as a good leader i would say you re a good leader because chris and i are here right now chris first started working with me i d have breakdowns all the time even just because like i didn t like the camera angle and then i d be like i m so sorry if i told you i didn t like the camera angle and yet we still showed up but i m saying like i don t like i don t want to take that i never want to be like in more of a leader position than i am now you know no but we love don t do that but we love working with you because i think that that s a good leadership quality but i don t but that s not like a personality trait i m taking on as myself like i don t i don t i m not leading anyone you know what are you saying i see myself as a good leader i and i would agree with that i think you are a good leader but it s only because i won t ask anybody to do something i wouldn t do myself yes but you re also very proactive like you ll just like yes i think you re a good leader um i m assertive i wish honestly there s nothing A A wrong with the A A that i have selected that is yellow i don t think so either and i would say i am assertive i m very confused by the yellow and blue i don t i just think the top one s blue at the bottom s yellow i don t think it has a negative connotation i am assertive i m assertive too um i like to have authority over people i don t mind following others i do not mind following orders me either honestly more often than not i would much prefer to follow somebody else s orders it s a lot less i m only thinking of it in like the youtube sense like i wouldn t like to have a boss being like you need to make this video no well i m thinking of it like i either want to be doing my dream job but i don t want to be doing like if i m doing another job i don t want to be the boss of it right you know that s how i m thinking of it too yeah like yeah okay like i ve never run for office i do what i m told and i ve never run for office because i don t want to change the orders that have been relayed to me as a citizen right i find it easy to manipulate people i don t like it when i find myself manipulating people i would say i don t like it i don t like it either okay i insist upon the respect that is due to me i usually get the respect i deserve i would say i would say i usually get the respect i deserve because i personally believe that if you re not getting the respect if you i i believe if you have to insist upon respect you are not getting it and i also feel like if you re if you if you really do respect yourself you wouldn t let people treat you in a way that is disrespectful yeah i mean and it s not like you need to tell someone not to disrespect you you just don t A A with that person that s what i mean so i also am i m also saying i usually get the respect i deserve yeah um i don t particularly like to show off my body or i like to show off my body i don t really like to shut off my body me either i don t have muscles to phone home about secret but i do have great boobs um i can read people like a book people are sometimes hard to understand people are sometimes hard to understand for me like and it s the like sometimes when people are just upset and i m yeah i think i can read people like a book sometimes but you re a little hard for me to read really yeah interesting like just now when you thought i was attacking you over the kardashians i didn t think that you i thought i was very clearly not attacking you well you were just such a in like a state of uh oh i m angry at fashion thompson anger for in defense of chloe that i felt like it was directed towards me when i don t disagree with your standpoint i just felt like you were attacking i thought you were saying i was saying chloe should be embarrassed like no but he s putting her embarrassing situations which invokes the feeling of embarrassment to me yeah and that s why i think it s being projected on to her yeah and i agree with that and at the same time i m saying like A A that and i understand that as well exactly okay do you want to read the next one if i feel competent i m willing to take responsibility for making decisions yes if i t i like to take responsibility for making decisions i would say if i feel competent i am willing to take responsibility i m not a hundred percent always down for decision making but it says i like to take responsibility for make oh no yeah like i like to feel competent before i m making the call for anyone like if someone s like do we take it s like we were talking about a couple weeks ago like i don t want to i don t want to pick the A A music station i don t feel competent and understanding everybody s musical needs right no choice for a group of unless it s jersey mike s and everybody s A A down and if you re not A A temperatures you might get out of the group okay i just want to be reasonably happy i want to amount to something in the eyes of the world i just want to be happy don t want to worry about things i d be lying if i didn t say like i moved to la to make a career in entertainment which i would think would be the bottom one i mean yes but i also think so there s like a difference right so it s like when you and i talk about success we re not talking about it the same way that other people would talk about it we re talking about being good at what we do right and getting to do what we love and making a living at it yeah but i mean it s arguable that like are we great podcast host or is it like a little narcissistic to have a podcast i think both i think we re both and that s why i m confused with this one because i do want to be reasonably happy at this stage in my life but i would be lying a little bit if i didn t say all of my s were in search of because everybody s s are focused on becoming a little bit of something but i also believe that i don t think validation is something that you i don t think you do the podcast for validation no so that s that s what i think the difference is okay then i ll do i will yeah because you re right like i i yes cause you can amount to something in the eyes of the world and not be happy and i don t think that s what you want no i would rather be happy than be the most popular youtuber on the platform yeah yeah okay my body is nothing special i like to look at my body i like to look at my body i mean i m done with this A A where i pretend like i hate myself i mean i i work out a lot of times i m not like oh i want to show off my body but i don t want do i look like a victoria s secret angel no is my body A A everything hell yeah yeah also this A A has gotten me through almost years of life i like to A A look at her and i like to say listen A A okay you strong as A A look at that butt i try to back it up i try not to be a show off i will usually show off when i get the chance well i guess this is difficult for us to follow up my last little self but it s like is it showing off if i m just looking at my own ass in the mirror i try not to be a show off i will usually show off when i get the chance i feel like social media has made everyone a show off right but like do we really post oh the last thing i posted i think was about my cute hair i mean i m gon na say i usually show off when i get the chance because i think everyone does on social media like i think if you have a social media account you you show off the the highlights of your life like nobody s you know okay i always know what i m doing sometimes i m not sure of what i m doing oh i m not sure what i m doing sometimes i don t know what i m doing sometimes i depend on people to get things done i rarely depend on anyone to get things done i depend on people sometimes well often i m not like a super independent worker like i like to have like like i couldn t do a podcast alone there s no way in hell even with my videos like i like shane to like watch through it once to get a second opinion on like oh that should be i don t know if getting a second opinion is something that you depend on would you not post if you didn t have a second opinion no i still would but i m still gon na stand by i depend on other people i m gon na say i rarely depend on anyone else to get things done because i m gon na say that s true for you okay sometimes i tell good stories everybody likes to hear myself why do i have to keep reading the ones that are embarrassing i would say sometimes i only i only hit it out of the park every once in a while i think everybody likes to hear my stories and i m going to eat A A in the comment section for that no i don t think so i think that s why we a lot of people are like this podcast is good because of lizzie and i think it s because you re a natural born storyteller i get a great i expect a great deal from other people i like to do things for other people i like to do things for other people and i do expect other people i know i m both well this is i think this isn t how you and i are reading it i think when you expect a great deal from other people it s like in return from other people but you and i just expect decentness from other people do you know what i m saying so we ll say i like to do things for other people yeah i think that s more true than what the other thing means um i will never be satisfied until i get all that i deserve i take myself i in my age right now i take my satisfactions as they come like i really try to be grateful every morning when i wake up i try to like state five things i m grateful for yeah and also i think i will never be satisfied until i get all that i deserve is nobody deserves anything that s an entitled ass A A notion literally nobody deserves a single thing and life isn t fair so compliments embarrass me i like to be complimented compliments me yeah i mean it s not that i don t like them but it s like i don t know how to like i don t know how to write you just say thanks no i have skin cancer thank you uh i have a strong uh will to power power for its own sake doesn t interest me oh yeah like i don t want to be an authority of many other people i mean i psychotically have a strong will to power okay but like you said earlier like i think that is a trait that i ve uh evolved to because of being a small child with not a lot of power and a lot of upsetting situations right okay i don t care about new fads and fashions i like i don t care about you i don t care um i like to look at myself in the mirror i m not particularly interested in looking at myself in the mirror i like to look in the mirror i avoid mirrors like when i m walking i don t avoid them but it s not like i m stopping to look it you re so beautiful i i m not saying i don t think i am no i know but i m just saying and this is you being bad taking a compliment but like you are a handsome like i don t like to discover i have a new zit that i didn t see before that s none of your business yeah um okay i like to be the center of attention it makes me uncomfortable to be we ve already these repeats there s only nine more questions you guys i can live my life in any way i want to people can t always live uh their lives in the terms they want to i m gon na say people can t always live their lives in the terms they want to but why is it i can and then people can t because i do feel like i mean well i m just thinking about like if i can t afford a jersey mic sandwich i can t afford a jersey mike sandwich and my the terms of life that i want are jersey mike sandwiches so i just think it s weird because ones i can and the other ones people can t maybe that s the test of it are you singularly focused on yourself or do you understand that not everybody including yourself can live all right i don t know um being an authority doesn t mean that much to me people always seem to recognize my authority much to me i would prefer to be a leader it makes a little difference to me whether i m a leader or not i mean i it depends on the situation yeah like i keep thinking about my work yeah and i guess i do prefer to be a leader in my work because if i wasn t then what would it be like you know i mean i think for me like they re again they re instances when i like to be led and instances where i like to lead okay so what are you doing i m gon na say little difference because it s situational for me okay then i will too i am going to be a great person i hope to be successful i mean i m going to be a great person because i think great people are successful you know i think that s and i d rather be a good person than a bad person well you can be great and not successful as well but i think you can be one in this you can be both um people sometimes believe what i tell them i can make anybody believe anything i want them to i think people sometimes believe what i do yeah i m not a great liar honestly lying makes me anxious i m a born leader leadership is a quality that takes a long time to develop i think it s both um i think it s a quality that takes a long time to develop like i don t think anyone has the natural instincts to just create a billion dollar company then explain why i ve been successful straight out the womb explain it okay make it make sense i wish somebody would someday write my biography i don t like people to pry into my life for any reason i don t like people to pride in my life for any reason i mean yeah if i was going to write a biography i d want to write it myself and i don t have any um any ounce of me that wants to write anything wants to read my life and who wants i wouldn t even want to write like i a book deal sounds like the worst deal for me like i honestly want to write a book i m also like laughing it s like my urdu my earliest memory was playing in a cupboard in the kitchen riveting stuff okay i get upset when people don t notice how i look when i go in public i don t mind being uh blending into the crowd when i go in public i m gon na admit it i get upset really i don t but it s like not real it s like faux upset but i am a little bit upset and i m the opposite like i don t i want to go to trader joe s and just like nobody i don t you know i just want to like get in and get out and i hate when we re in public and you get recognized like it makes me anxious but sometimes i will go in public and i ll be like why is nobody recognizing me i m in my demographic right now i am more capable than other people there is a lot i can learn from other people there s a i love i think like to be successful is to learn from other people absolutely and always you can always learn something from someone else including a difficult person oh always maybe more from a difficult person yeah and also like interacting with human beings is the closest you re going to get to god on this earth because each one of us is a child god so be A A nice all right i am much like everybody else i m an extraordinary person no i m extraordinary i m sorry i would say i m much like everyone else lies no i just think i work hard i really don t think i have anything that ryland you literally guessed cheesecake factory in that video but that s like also you did something else that was like ground bake breaking like you broke the simulation like you A A predicted some A A i don t remember what it was but like recently you did do that you re an extraordinary person A A hit it or don t i didn t but i m just screenshotting the questions so that i can share them with them do i need to scream across crap i think it s fine i actually i should probably screenshot them without okay let s go to show me my score what did you get okay wait maximum is average range for american is but what does that mean highest tested celebrity with this is so i think is the highest score and that means you re the most narcissistic but the most narcissistic on record is so like is the most narcissistic person on record so out of i was a six i got ta go Laughter screenshot your results chris chris oh hold on let me turn on your mic i m red what were you chris i m a six oh wow well i m a see i i think you re fine i think i m fine too and i don t like this test making me feel bad for the fact that i m a i think that makes me great well i don t like say you have narcissistic traits which i know you do yeah but i feel very safe with you because i think that you re so self actualized and you re always trying to make yourself a better person and even though like even when you re in like your throes of like doing self centered things you don t expect a response or a reaction right like even if you like send me texts about you yeah you re fine if i don t reply for hours yeah or ever right because often times i forget what i ve said but your score for authority is medium your score for self sufficiency is low which seems like a lie to me your score for superiority is medium i ll take it your score for exhibitionism is medium which i think is weird because i don t agree with that i barely release the short films i make do you know what i mean your score for vanity is medium i agree with that your score for entitlement is low so everything on mine is low except for authority i m a medium and for vanity i m a medium which i agree with both of those things um self sufficiency though i would have thought maybe would have been a medium like i almost take that as an insult that i m low on self me too and you know i i don t i think having a little bit of like i don t think having a medium score means you re an awful person i think a lot of these traits are are some things that are very are very good to utilize in your day to day life especially if you want to be efficient i think a lot of people that run businesses and corporations and companies are probably high functioning narcissists so like the world needs them too it s just a little more tricky if they re your significant other and you just have to find uh you i mean with every relationship you just have to find like the ways that you exactly you interact and love each other it s like sometimes i do find an issue with my uh authoritativeness or whatever like sometimes i m like in this moment am i mad because i m wrong and is it more valuable for me to be right or to get the A A out of this anger right and it s like well you know it s more valuable for me to get the A A out of this anger yeah but i do think that my knee jerk reaction is to be but it s like so quickly when i feel that it s like an alarm goes off in my brain it s like wait a minute A A let s unpack this what is the easiest way through this that doesn t require your your heat raising your heart throbbing and your voice getting louder and i think that all comes with age and you like practicing and not enjoying the res the results of negative behavior right but then i i realize that there are some people who like recognize their negative behavior and double down on it because they re not getting the response and it s like why don t you try and that s what i mean it can be very dangerous yeah like so you know and like when that happens i m just like i m gon na not engage here all right ever again well if you took the test let us know in the comment section below don t forget to rate and review our podcast on apple podcast we would love that

got tested for cold flu strep bronchitis covid he was like nothing bro and I was like you can t give me anything he s like nothing bro just take some nice he said bro you talk to you like that no but in my head like that s what was happening just wondering you got to make something exciting after you re robbed at Urgent Care I spent over for all these tests to like ensure that I could maybe be around people which like should I be around people it was up even you guys well I think it s a questionable thing no but like normally when I m sick I lose all motivation to do anything like I can t exist as a human and my energy levels are still high I just have all this sinus A A going on and I think like going to different climates like Colorado Vegas here yeah and it s been like wilding out and everything s blooming yeah it s just like I m back in my post nasal drip era oh so I have a question no is this era s thing yeah like part of eras but was it it does pre date ERA so Taylor Swift jumped on a bandwagon um maybe but it s also just the what the word era means right but like so the eras to her are all of her so how long have people been saying like I m in my sick era um like is that maybe like a year oh wow maybe nine months I ve arrived here I am he s just got ta wait for it to come on Instagram reels and then he ll know in another life you re in your pop star era I got a doppelganger submission for you what it s crazy tell me more you might have serious fomo that you re not actually her unless you are who is it I don t know so this person contact the Sip gmail com yeah and we do doppelgangers a lot oh my gosh don t look that does not look like me yes it does oh my God it looks so much like you okay so this person said I was shuffling songs on Spotify and came across this artist called Lily is that you which I m gon na say Lizzy is that you can you please look at this photo and tell me it isn t her Lizzy s in her pop star era and I support this wholeheartedly okay let me show Chris first because I feel like you re already being a hater if she was wearing this outfit tell me that s not Lizzy I mean I definitely I wish I had Chris s reaction because it was like shook beyond belief this is the best doppelganger of all time when do I get to see this right now no she s way cuter than me Lizzy no literally if I styled you in this same outfit you got me a rhinoplasty I m her have you seen what s going on with this Buckle fat removal buccal Buckle I call it Buckle I hate think it s awful I think it s a travesty that people are doing it s irreversible shut up and it s hideous I just think all of these celebrities looking like hot Squidward by the time they re over it there will be a solution but I feel like at least the injectables you can hopefully dissolve some of them yeah but it s wild like first was those epic all these celebrities are wild so I feel like I was like some of these bodies aren t meant to be that thin and then we got some bulbous heads out in these streets you know what I m saying like some bodies are meant to have a little bit of sorry yes flush you know yes flesh and muscle and fat it s supposed to be like stuff on top of Bones and ozempic is taking away everything and leaving you a bag of bones with some weird Skeletor Noggins but even with you like uh our first so like actually what inspired the segment advice though uh popped up for me because I was like searching for something the other day and I sent it to you and you were like wow I was so skinny and I was like honestly you look so much better now oh yeah I wasn t saying it like a longing for it but I m just looking like wow I was so but I m just saying as an example you were just saying like some people are meant to have and it s not like you re not big by any means but I think like with a tiny bit more yeah it s hot more it s like yeah you you look it s like you and your Peach Booty like I might have taken a bath and watched your Vlog last night that might have been something I did because I m upset upset with you I didn t finish your Vlog I was texting you up the ass the other day about your baby names you missed the tease for the next episode which is us going to Vegas you A A um well that s I m not upset about that okay I am upset about the fact that you and you just did it again and you just hard left it in the middle of a conversation to be asking what your baby names are what are you hiding I m not I I have this weird thing did you reveal your baby names on this Vlog yes you didn t even get to that no because I was mad when I realized what was happening I was like this A A I was texting him Chris I was texting him I said what are your baby names he said some things are for me something like that something like I don t not for you to know right now like this is I m playing this close to the chest I kept just like changing the subject and she kept circling it back to that but here s the thing I don t want to reveal that on text and I barely wanted he wants to reveal it on YouTube no everyone but me you re included if you would watch what are the names is it my name should I finish it I just got irate and I was like done I m done with this Vlog and it gets no more view what a loogie it s a Clarity I ll throw up no okay do I want to make that noise on Mike again it s the Claritin D it clumps it all together don t talk about it like that listen a couple seasons ago I also had this post nasal drip we all remember and it was in the height of of it and every day I was like I m giving everyone covid but I went to the doctor times and was post nasal drip and I have all the same symptoms so just let me post anything I need I need you to cool on it for a second because I can feel my vomit Rising okay I love that I m just looking at pop star Lizzy while we re having these conversations um okay so everything everywhere all at once Lizzy yeah Shane is that of you and likes to talk about baby names all day every day and I m like can t we just like it s a vulnerable thing for me because I feel like choosing someone s name is such a big decision yeah and so if you don t like it that s why I m taking the pressure I don t want to just like throw it out in a text I would never tell you I didn t like it by the way I know but like I would rather see your reaction in person no matter what no matter what you re gon na think I love it how s that for a comfort zone I m just kidding because that s why I didn t tell you because I would rather tell you in person than give you a text message because I want to like I don t know it s very vulnerable for me and for some reason like because my head hurts and I m like overworked at this point I m feeling like being just an awful A A and I want to make jokes right now but I m worried that it s gon na stick in some of my friends heads that watch this show and I don t want to be held responsible for it in real life okay but then after that Lizzy told me what like her she s seriously considering for her baby name and I was like oh pressure s off I can text her any baby name that I have Roy I mean like it s it s good because it doesn t A A matter you remember it s like A A it name him Roy who cares and it s growing on me I did realize I can t call I don t think I can call him Roy because I ve made this joke so many times but I think that Joe s brother Joe s dad s brother is maybe name Roy who cares well I ve made so many jokes about it at this point that it s like pretty harsh for it to be a living relative s name too okay who cares A A it remember Roy I do think it s funny Roy Henderson Roy Anderson I m okay and isn t Henderson what you got from Vegas uh well it s not like a disease it s a place we went to in Vegas I m kidding Henderson was gorgeous we kept going to the Best Buy in Henderson in Vegas if you haven t been to the Best Buy in Henderson Las Vegas you are not living Oh no you re not it was actually a beautiful Best Buy maybe it s like top five I ve ever been to it was well stocked um so do you want to know the baby names of course you re over it of course I do or should I make them watch my Vlog oh my God tell me okay so for a boy we re thinking Parker but this is only if we don t live in Colorado because that d be like a little weird yeah but oh wait wait wait no that s the girl s name okay wait am I right yeah the girl is Parker I mean you can go either way with Parker I know but it s the girl and the boys jet I love both of those questions on like is it Jetson and Jet for sure or is it just Jet and you stop at the T I like jet I think it s cool so I d be Jet and Parker a little twin boy girl twins running around yeah I mean did you drop a girl in a boy or a pregnancy has to take second both the embryos would have to take but you dropped a boy and a girl embryo your plan is to drop a boy and a girl yes very soon I know oh that s crazy yeah chat the surrogate was sending I m sorry I ve already forgotten Parker I already forgot I was gon na say jet and Royston but my head hurts so bad I love those names did you not take Advil no of course this is the version of you you re giving me I know it s awful Music it is nice though do my eyes look awful no because they re killing me they re like I don t understand what you mean by that they re just like they re so tired that they re closing on you no like they burn an ache huh because I was staring at a computer screen for like hours you re editing yeah or Taylor Swift I guess vlog what just happened to you well you were telling me you can t title it yeah people didn t want to watch my Taylor Swift Vlog where I didn t go to Taylor Swift I Just titled my Vlog opening night of Taylor Swift

what thank God Taylor Swift wasn t in a place where people I follow art this weekend because I honestly can t take it either you know it s like when she s in Vegas or Arizona or La it s like everyone from La goes there that I know and I m just like I can t I have to shut up right and that s what I said to Lizzy after we went to Vegas I was like should we just say A A it and go this weekend too do you know what happened Chris Chris still doesn t know what happened so on Saturday last Saturday at three o clock in the afternoon I m dead asleep on the couch this A A texts me pictures of Open tickets we gave the play by play already I know but he doesn t know okay so we just went to Vegas at P M to go to a show that starts at six and we made it and then there were no flights back on Sunday and all we just and all we did was go to A A Best Buy and Target that s all we did we went to the buffet and we hit a buffet at the win and it was delicious it was it was a Great Buffet was the show amazing oh that was so good I m going again in August and I ve got to go again too oh really yeah I ve got two who are you gon na take it s gon na be one of your family members isn t it you bastards you already have tickets I don t care the bag this is oh except for when I go in August with someone else I had something to say until you so rudely interrupted oh what were you gon na say you miss us being on the floor in Vegas of course I do I tried to grab drag your ass to Hawaii did I not like email you or text you or whatever you multiple times saying can I just plan this trip to Hawaii and let you know the day before because you don t like planning right and you just left me on red there too which I know in Ryland means no it means no it means wait for it till I answer you on my Vlog later what else do you have to tell me about this weekend what do I have to tell you about oh you accidentally did what oh I accidentally called the police this morning this morning yeah this a m yeah that was stressful that was a lot it was a lot to deal with very early in the morning how do you accidentally do that so I m watching a video in the shower because I m codependent with my phone I m phone dependent so what do you do do you like I m trying to stick back no it s waterproof dude I just have it in the shower I ll even be on the phone in the shower all the time so I turn the volume up on my phone but I m like wet and like can t see so I m accidentally just hitting this button over and over some contacts it s concerning you don t shower with your contacts in no matter what they wouldn t have helped me yeah I do I put my contacts in to shower what like before I shower I put my contacts in I don t think I know anything about contacts but I also think it s safe to say that I m way too sensitive for contacts yeah but you walk into a place and you can t see a person because you don t touch the street they have a house guest right now and because I wasn t wearing my glasses from across the room I thought it was Ryland and then I went oh you re not Ryland and I okay um anyway you hit this button five times in a row and it calls the cops what so you don t turn up the volume so you re online with butt ass naked watching film A A news show on my phone A A call the cops on myself like and you would like in my mind I was like oh that s Genius Like if you re being kidnapped you just go well first you have to know about the feature it s like they haven t promoted it well that s why I m sharing it right now it feels like I can be helpful after I ve called the police thank God we re saving the world I am I ve got multiple things to save the world today by the way I m on some I m on some philanthropic A A okay so you re watching some conspiracy theories on tick tock they re like how can I help you when you re like no literally though but it doesn t do that the thing that s a bummer is like if you are being kidnapped and you re trying to use this is like a Sly A A like you don t know but the cops are on their way it s not that because it it goes Amber Alert okay that s enough of that I get to keep going I know you could okay with a headache by the way this is how I know you re a liar like I could never with a headache oh it hurts but I you know what else am I supposed to do end it all okay okay so yeah so then what if you re trying to make a loud call to the police you go ahead and five times on this little A A and then an alert will sound your phone will vibrate and the kidnappers will maybe throw you out of the car you keep giving me blue balls what happens after that it s a it just starts flashing emergency SOS we re calling the police and then it rings and then the police answer and then I was like click but the weird thing is when I had a landline if you called the cops in the s they would answer immediately and uh if you hang up they call you back and this morning I hang up and they didn t call me back and I just feel like they re like she s not so not just another murder my husband and right honestly figure it out for real and then let him go but I also noticed this when I called the police in an emergency situation one time they like didn t answer like I was like on hold for minutes that happened to me too and I m just like what is wrong with the world Mama a lot so what s your other savior tip today we ll get to it it s on the or unless you deleted it okay I mean I delete some things I took we ll figure it out oh okay you had beef with me I have beef with you oh my god did you get my coins back your coins all my coins okay Spirit Airlines oh no Chris Chris Vegas Chris oh no you didn t answer his call I was hiking with someone and I couldn t have that conversation in front of them you couldn t have a shaky voice confrontation in front of them do you really want to throw some balls do you really want to bring this oh God for it I don t you really want to bring this to the iPod fine oh no baby I love you as your best friend I don t think we should shed light on this at the moment no maybe we did I don t know that was a fever dream I m still recovering did you see how awful I looked this week this last week I wasn t looking mess Chris anyway yeah no I didn t do any of those things I should add that to my to do I can not believe you didn t answer they re never gon na get back to you now it s like the screen grab of it I ve been a wrecking combat I know but they re like gon na be like too far too gone like you want your hundred dollars back no way facts I was doing some Karen A A in Vegas and then that started to fight with my family because I was telling Joe about it because I thought it was so funny well Lizzie did say after I was Stern oh she said wow I want to have your babies well just the way that I had to do like okay just the way I stood up for me in case we didn t talk about it last week we were robbed in Vegas by the housekeepers but the housekeepers it s not because of the housekeepers because of the hotel no no they checked us out and the hotel I mean listen if I was housekeeping and somebody left all their Chargers I m gon na take them too it s like they re not coming back to Vegas but we hadn t left but they didn t know that because nothing had been handled appropriately on any party s part the bottom line is we can all admit where we re wrong in this he s so pit we re missing he s so pissed about the principal getting toiletries in Vegas wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait don t jump don t jump the story so we he s so pissed like the head of security comes to our room to file a complaint for us and Rylan starts the story at Hours previous when he decides to just get on a plane and go to Vegas with nothing he goes so it s Saturday I want to see Vegas my husband says call Lizzy audience you didn t think I was gon na do a set wait this guy goes hold on sir I m gon na interrupt you because I need to know I feel like you don t believe me in your poking holes in my story and I m just trying to tell you what happened and he goes no no sir it s not that I don t believe you and it s not that I m poking holes your story and I don t care I just I need to know what was taken like was it a very valuable object do I need to have security closing off the doors all the entrances to the casino like no thank God my golden keys were returned she goes like was it a Rolex was it something expected Applause it was a travel sized bottle of Cetaphil but it s not the items that are missing that matters it s the amount of time it took to accumulate them I m gon na take the hit here but this story is layered and just know that five o clock in the morning I wake up to go pee and he s like on his phone spiraling he s like I don t think that guy got the best side of me ha Congress all day we just can t be like someone tell Christ we re so sorry we re so sorry but I do think that they should reimburse us okay okay anyway they finally called me back about the complaint while I was hiking with someone else and I didn t have it in me to have that conversation in front of another adult well what was crazy is like Lizzie booked the first night and so the room was under her name so then when he called uh like the higher up manager he I start like going in on it and she s like sir your name s not on the room I can t talk to you and she said I have to talk to Lizzy so that s why I passed the fun to listen and she s like you I m a good friend and if my friend is riding hard I m gon na ride hard with them I m gon na match their energy and you really tried to do the day but I really did I was like listen about this um we here s where here s where I feel we there were I was we were told something would have been executed and then we were told it had on your end not been done so we okay and that s why I feel like bad and then we hung up I was like did I do okay then I was like we just got ta call it like do we want to spend our whole night doing this I could have already replaced our toilet toiletries I just got ta like come off The Ledger and then I told Joe the story because I thought it was so funny and he goes you would never match my energy oh and I was like oh dude s right I wouldn t because I I would be like shut up Laughter I would be like baby do not talk to Chris like that and so he was really upset so now I have to A A ride for that A A in public too can you imagine what that s gon na be like and here I am making relationships healthier are you is that the takeaway stand in your truth mama oh my God or his truth

thought to myself was like Wow Riley really needs this I know and the internet thinks so too because like right believe it or not she s pretty well behaved but like when she s jumping on the tables when I m Vlogging I just like can t help but think it s so adorable so I don t stop her so then they think it s how I am always but I m like it s for the entertainment value just enjoy my cute ass puppy anyway my dog is a gentleman now really just like that there s no more pee in your house no he s still shooting and missing in the house it was but one class that he did not attend I only attended it what you went without him yeah so the first class you go without your dog and then you bring it you yes they are wow so it was interesting um there was a lot taken away from it and it s all positive reinforcement training which really works for me um because I couldn t stand telling that little baby no right um so I went out I ve been living my life with treat like a little treat bag on my hip and um like how you were doing with Riley like you say her name she looks at you go yes and then give her a treat so there it s uh he knows that he s positively reinforced when his attention is on me yeah doing left hand training let like left hip training so before we go out on the walk I just reward him every time he comes to my left hip and then on the walk he doesn t pull right and he s a puller that A A is like he s a puller and I was doing that Emma walk and I was like he s not a puller and then the funnest part of the class is you have to socialize them so you have to take them out into the world somewhere where there s like people and like other dogs and things and you take a picture of them and talk about it at class the next week wow the homework of it all yeah so I took him to the pet store and we got him a better harness and um we were doing the positive reinforcement left side training in the store two different dogs came in and like the other dogs were barking and icky was focused on me wow I was like you are a good boy see I ve got to get back on it too I brought my little treat pouch from Colorado when we were there I was like I got ta start up on this again because I do I have the tools because I also went through eight sessions which were as much for me as they were for Riley but I just have to keep implementing them it was funny though because we were practicing the the what s it called the order of the treat reinforcement so first it s you get the positive behavior from the dog then you say yes then you give them the treat so what they had all those owners break into groups of two and they gave us treats and to practice on each other going yes and then putting the truth in the hand and the guy that I was paired with couldn t do it and I was like is it my place to correct his behavior right now and then I was like no it s not yeah that was the big thing with my guy too is like he if I was doing it repetitively and then I like lost my rhythm he d be like nope you got ta you got ta stay on the beats a bit because it s very crucial to their learning yeah so we were doing like the person opposite you opens their hand yes then the treat and the guy was working without my hand he d go yes yes yes like that and I was like he s so nice though aren t they all his dog s probably out of control because he s a narcissist did you prank any A A on April st no I feel like that s your holiday I know me too wow and you flopped I really flopped did you Chris of course Chris Chris did no yeah Chris told his boyfriend he was pregnant no did you bring anyone no I m not that kind of girly did you get pranked no I don t like pranks okay that s weird I thought you would no I mean I don t mind a good A A ass but a prank really like I don t know they seem mean right like have you seen the tick tocks where the like spouse runs in screaming that like a celebrity that you love has died oh that s funny no I hate it oh I think that s so evil you think that s evil yeah I just don t like it I mean it is bad energy to speak that into the world so I get it but I also think that s it s a little less harmful I think that there are like really harmful ones that I don t like all right I couldn t think of an example right now but I do think there are harmful ones I uh when I was younger my friends trusted me with their Facebook passwords so that I could stalk people who had blocked me and one April Fool s Day I think I went on Kate s Facebook page and posted a sonogram photo that and then I lost access to her password sorry was that UK call me the worst two weekends to be on social media are upon us Coachella aren t you so sick of seeing I think people are sick of going I m burnt out like I can t even I can t and it s not even like the Taylor thing it s not like I have fomo it s like the annoyance of it all it s not just Canon turretting last year we wanted to go for a minute I mean if somebody offers me tickets I m gon na go but I don t have like fomo of watching the people s stuff I just it s like enough with the content of it all I just think it s not I mean I don t know because I love pageantry I love dressing up I love all of that but I do feel like the people on the caliber of the event has really diminished maybe thanks to covet I don t know should we go yeah we ll see you next time it s crazy how I can do like a on things so fast yeah I can talk myself in and out of anything let s go Chris pack your bags and we re making five Vlogs we re going right now early I mean if we were smart we would have planned you know me though like I can t plan anything no you can t and he won t even let you plan anything and not tell them you re like if we go to Coachella it s gon na be day off I m gon na be like Chris and let s see are you guys ready to go I ll be like A A it let s says no they re left out okay um I guess we should get into some hot tubbies oh yeah my favorite of the week is this Gwyneth trial I know I love that it s taken Gwyneth going on this ski trial for me to realize you are her thank you I know the internet has such varied opinions of her but I take that as a compliment and if you hate me for that I don t know what to tell you he wishes you well I wish you well so the Gwyneth Paltrow ski trial ended in a positive conclusion for you goop girl this guy was wiling out he was kids I think we re at the Forefront of being like you need to do this but then when uh they brought up all of the traveling that he has done in the past three years since this ski accident with him being alive well and adventurous I was just like what are you doing for those of you that haven t been following Gwyneth Paltrow went on a ski trip with her family like six years ago or something three years ago and she had a collision with another skier during a ski class and that skier then said he was horribly injured from the accident that was her fault and sued her for x amount of money and she countersued him for one dollar based on the principle of you ran into me and this is weird people extortion and she won that case this week and has had I felt the whole time I was like this A A like her time is so valuable in terms of like where she puts it like she s running a huge company she s not going to take off all this time from work to go defend herself if she was in the wrong she would have just handed over the cash I also think that this is like it was great the Taylor counter sued for a dollar against the sexual I think it was maybe assault the guy actually touched her body and pinched her butt so I think that s assault and then um Gwyneth counter staying for a dollar here I think the next step is like A A sue him for his bag soon for his A A back he came for years come for his that s equality take his A A money yeah and she could have quite honestly instead like A A Gwyneth Paltrow walks out she like leans every time she goes I wish you well and that s all Wellness oh that s on help that s the last thing she said to him and then he s such a weirdo he like went to the meeting he was like she was very nice she said I wish you well I said so nice to meet you and we were like well maybe you re gon na follow each other on Tick Tock and it s like no you re not oh this is not on the docket but I was just reminded I ve been wanting to talk to you about this she Courtney Cox on Tick Tock A A killing it no but hasn t she always been no Courtney Cox recently took to tick tock oh see I had recent I mean I every once in a while stumble upon one of her reels on Instagram and it s always like popping off oh she s so funny so if you re not following Courtney Cox on Tick Tock what the A A are you doing so is there like following user two eight two nine six zero three three five nine two seven eight nine hello because that s me and if you want our tips and tricks about the Eris tour in the description section below um no so she s she s just funny the first thing she posted was like uh okay Tick Tock let s do this if I m not too late because now they re talking about turning Tick Tock off oh right um and then she did a funny one where she went around and cleaned all of her friends Hollywood stars like on the Walk of Fame that s actually really good yeah and then she did one where she s like looking at Instagram bodies and she s like I want to look like that and then does and is a baddie like looks so hot how can she come up with these Concepts I don t know they look High produced though wow you re you overthink it you go it doesn t seem too over I mean that those are like okay she has very good ideas and then are you saying they re like executed like with the support of the team but like not with the support of a team I would say okay so that s still overthinking it like it s a production it no they re simple they re simple Concepts here but hilarious super funny I don t know that we should be doing this why not because it s like um because I don t have internet service if I have the service we d be playing them here and now but I don t so we re not okay okay um are any of these things something you need to talk about yeah all of them okay Martha Stewart Martha Stewart uh do you guys know how hot that A A is yeah did you did you have you seen her straps I saw the one uh yes I ve seen them the first one was like a year ago she was like it like in the pool like laying back like titties up like blips purse looking A A hot and snatched like Martha Stewart is hot and the funniest thing about that she was like I was just in my pool and I was trying to take a photo of the landscape but I opened the camera and it was on selfie mode and I thought damn I look good she did so she was like I took the picture and posted it and here we are so now the headline is she plans to post more thirst traps yeah she s like we re only getting started get ready girls I just made a little Martha Stewart face if you re Audio Only that s what that pause was so nothing else no I thought that was great but that s the Taylor Swift Tick Tock that is yeah I mean it s a okay you don t know you re on document I mean how would I remember what that is okay I was gon na tell you tell me okay so there s a story oh I remember okie dokie so one of the more notable eras to our news items is there was a couple who was gon na go to the show and they were mugged and their phones were stolen pickpocketed pickpocketed is there a difference between the two I mean yeah I guess I feel like that one s a little bit more violent yeah right it s like a specific I m gon na steal your phone one s more like maybe one s more traumatizing or inducing well the pickpocketing a lot of the time I don t think you even know what happens exactly you go to grab your phone and you re like sometimes I feel like you could claim picket parking even if it s just your bad picket pocketing pocket picking I don t know okay I have a headache I m doing my best okay I have a cough I m doing my best so anyways these people were not mugged but pick it pocketed okay what is it I don t know we got ta move on this is like I m bored anyway they had their tickets on their phones and you can not just take a screen grab of the ticket you have to be logged into your Ticketmaster account and then to move it to another phone you have to like actually use the device that you had in the first place did we learn that the hard way well boy we did but they called the police and they said if A A show up in these seats they re the ones who stole your phone no you missed a thing what they went back to okay somebody steals the phone yeah the people that lost their phone go back to their hotel they call their phone from the hotel they tell the people well there s really hot Taylor Swift tickets on there if you don t show up to that then you re stupid because they re not transferable to a different phone I doubt they said that that s a really obvious trap delay they probably were like give us our phones back please they have our Taylor Swift tickets on them I mean not what this guy said really so those thiefs then show up in those seats the people call the police the police go and find the thieves in the seat with the phone yeah and then the they re arrested and the couple is back at the Taylor Swift concert by the fifth song which is fine because the first few songs for me weren t it Jesus Christ yeah okay okay okay what s this one say AI something about AI oh yeah okay so we all know AI is taking the World by storm all of the world s leading Tech Minds have signed a letter that are telling all AI companies like please pump the brakes this is too much too fast it s like gon na take over Humanity we re not necessarily specifically terrified of a Skynet situation but we are worried about losing humanity and jobs and blah blah and blah blah ruin people ruining people s livelihoods yeah ruining people s livelihoods on top of that there has been an influx in AI scamming so people will take your voice off of your social media postings or your Vlogs or your podcasts that you post on the internet get in touch with your loved ones and fake your voice and scam them for money in emergency emergency scenarios one of the ones I heard about was this mother and father get a call from their son that he s in jail he s facing gnarly charges because he was a drunk driver that hit a pregnant woman and she lost the pregnancy and it s going to be fifty thousand dollars to bail him out of jail and in order to do that really quickly they have to get the money and then give it to a person that s coming to the house to get it and they re positive this is their son they they get it together really quickly someone comes like they said they would and collects the money to get the bail their son was never in a situation like that their son was at work the entire time and the money s gone because the AI is so Advanced it can mimic and replicate voices to a t yeah and that s like one example I mean the ways that criminals could use this on so many skills is insane and I was reading that they re targeting a lot of like older parents or like grandparents and I would fall for it like you call uh somebody s grandma and you re like hey sis guess what s going on and they re like oh my gosh yeah and I I think the moral of the story is if you get a call from a loved one now and it s not from their personal phone number you hang up and call their personal phone number immediately after and you quo and you make and if they don t like don t act on anything rapidly nothing s ever that serious nothing ever needs to be responded to that quickly that s like a clear indication of a scam someone s like no it s got to be right now and it s this much and it s right now because they re even doing it on a like a grander scale with like hundreds of millions of dollars from Banks convincing Banks to transfer money pretending to be the CFOs of these Banks like crazy people go to scam people it s like you could spend when I heard that one I thought maybe I should it feels like a victimless crime okay did you see the card I guess uh season three of the Kardashians is coming oh yeah I did see that like the trailer is felt nothing but I m gon na watch it okay what did you think the same thing yeah I was like it s giving it s giving nothing what are you doing you don t care about Chris Hemsworth it just seems a little dark I think it s sweet okay did you read about Chris Hemsworth this week so Chris Hemsworth apparently took a genetic test and found that he s predisposed to Alzheimer s and that there s a high likelihood that he ll suffer from Alzheimer s later in his life and as a result of such he s started he s decided that what s more valuable to him and his time is uh being with his family and his wife and so he started taking certain measures to either combat the Alzheimer s or to you know sort of in an in essence like First Dates himself like they re doing a lot of recording of big moments so that there s videos of it that he can watch back and all of these things but he s finishing he s decided that he s not retiring he s finishing out his contractual obligations and then taking less jobs to spend more time at home and I think that s kind of sweet that is beautiful and when you are faced with any health scare or life altering situation it is like a you got ta reevaluate and think why am I here and what s the purpose for everything yeah um and what kind of genetic testing was that I don t know wow yeah that is a hard thing to deal with because it s not immediate and you don t know when so it s like this will it and but I guess it s never too early to start living like yeah a better life I mean that there s so many songs about it right back you were dying sounds just like that um oh did you add this this morning what something about Katy Perry I did add something about Katy Perry this morning which election about it yeah I guess oh okay okay so did you know that Katy Perry is working on a tiny little TV show called American Idol yeah I ve heard about that yeah so she s doing that I saw a clip of her like crying who didn t um but there was a woman on the show who s like years old and has I think like three kids back at home and um a comment was made by uh I think the contestant said something like I m laying it all on the table or something and Katy Perry knowing that this woman has a bunch of children she said girl I think you ve laid on the table enough or something like that and the woman felt like shamed by it I might be wrong about the details of what the joke was this is what I ve garnered from the article I read this morning but um it when the moment went viral as Katy Perry mom shaming oh my gosh and then the woman of this last week on the show quit the show she said and Katie begged her to say Katie was like you got a yes you might get another yes like doors are opening for you like being a part of being a mom why would she jeopardize her own future to give her kids a better life she the contestant said I know I m probably gon na regret this when I get home but like my little ones and they re little my little ones need me and I feel like it s too selfish for me to stay on the show like I m going home so it s not in direct response no it s not indirect response okay I was like why would she but she s like yeah I want to go home and be with my children and Katy Perry was like a big part of motherhood is self love too like stay for yourself it s a great example for your kids and like all this stuff and the woman went home well I also think in everything you re a better you if your cup is full like sometimes getting out of the house or going to the gym or going to get lunch with a friend revitalizes you in a sense to like come home and be a better you to be more present for your kids to work to be better your job you know yeah I wholeheartedly believe in that I like in uh something that I say and try to remind myself of is I need to fill my cup so that I can share the Overflow wow I do love that yeah even I did not come up with it right but it is it s still a good sentiment yeah and I think like even something silly like us like last minute running to Vegas it like helps like re inspire like I m definitely inspired but I do think we re both dying well definitely there s some uh definite repercussions unwell like I ve been unwell all week my schedule is all off I haven t I ve like still not started setting timers to wake up on the phone I m like whenever I do I need a rest but I think like that kind like last week obviously if you listen to the podcast I was like a little like dragging my feet about some certain things and I just feel like sometimes you got to get out of your own way and just be like because for a second I just wanted to like wallow in whatever and now I m like back on like oh let s be a problem solver let s solve all the problems let s do all the things yeah let s go girls I sent two unsolicited Outreach emails for myself this morning good for you thank you do you want to elaborate um no no okay well so oh I will I will uh so I I m uh I am notorious for reaching out and have like I do it shamelessly and but I spiral with shame after I do it and nine times you ve seen me do it here like I ve spiraled about the embarrassing should I ve sent via email in front of you guys and I do think that it is good and commendable to reach out on your own behalf and if you re not getting the responses you want uh tweak your approach so this weekend I have a girlfriend who works on on on the side of reaching out where she gets reached out to a lot so she was like all right let s edit your approach because my Approach is like I want a baby and I m scared that I m going to be poor help me and she s like say none of that don t say any of that and I m like oh okay what do I say she s like well keep it very short she said if I get an email from someone reaching out to me and I have to scroll to read the whole thing no I won t read any of them nope she s like keep it short two sentences boom so I was like okay she s like and ask for what you want immediately it s implied when you re reaching out to somebody who s someone s like their job is so specific that obviously you re reaching out because of what they do you don t need to tell them that they know right so one of the ones I sent was just sort of like want to grab lunch yeah and then the other one was uh she because it s a person that I don t know as as well and she was like just you know flattery is good so flatter this woman in your own voice so I did and then you know say can I take you to lunch yeah and I think that s good then if you get the person at lunch there s more time to elaborate on what it is you want to do because you can never convey that in an email I m also like you got ta just take on the mindset of Kris Jenner if you re getting no you re asking the wrong person yeah and you got to change your approach and you got to do some workarounds and you got to figure out a way to make it happen this first well let s get into some advice oh because we re segwaying right into she titled this advice for a business A A please oh hi Ryland and Lizzy happy to say oh this was in December sorry girl I recently became a manager at a Waxing Salon which was my Five Year Plan for me four years ago so congratulations on hitting your goals hit the thingy yellow and I ve been struggling with balancing out work life and social life I focus so much on work and that s one of my biggest downfalls I don t know how to balance the two I ve been single for way too long LOL and need to find time to get out there what do you guys feel like has helped you balance your work and social life um social outside life um love the Pod by the way always love laughing after a day of work so congratulations dude yeah that s epic and I think now that you ve reached your Milestone you have to position your comfortable ish I m assuming at your job I think you need to prioritize the time to go do stuff for yourself and have it be non negotiable like I m not working Friday night or Saturday night and I m going out I m making plans you re not just gon na like sit on your couch because you had a long work day you re gon na like make an attempt to go out and have a life yeah for me I make my schedule set so and I ve only recently fully adapted to it it took me a long time to actually accomplish my goal goal of not working at all on weekends and since I I so like now I have a very set schedule like I work Monday through Friday I from nine till four pm and if I don t finish my goal for the day and I write down my goals for the day if I don t accomplish my goals for the day I will I will finish my goals for the day if it means going after P M but I don t uh work late into the evening if I don t have to and I do not work on weekends unless my husband asks me to right and that and when you stopped working on weekends because I had stopped I d say like a few months before you like there was one time where we could only make a podcast work on a weekend and I was like I m so overworked right now I just need the weekend and you re like fine like we just had like yeah okay and then once you started doing it too you were like oh my gosh oh my God I remember the first weekend where I had nothing to do and I was like what and obviously not everyone is in a position to be able to like take weekends specifically off but like you like you you do it you can not do your job if it s again if your cup is A A empty you can not help anyone around you your cup needs to be full for you to do your job I m assuming her as a manager of a salon you have a lot of like hourly employees that are maybe calling out or texting you while you re off or there s all of these things but I think you need to implement a system where like maybe one of your assistant managers is on call for one of your like your two day off sessions or like you ve got to put a system in place you got to be like effective at work so that when you re off of work you can go find and have a life I think you just have to actually prioritize it yeah and um what helps me as I set alarms so I have an alarm that goes off at four o clock every day uh to remind me like oh I m done I also have a really hard time focusing and my job doesn t include include a lot of other people so I have also started doing a thing we re all set because I ll find myself blocking out and I ll look down at my phone I ll be like oh A A how long have I been scrolling through Tick Tock instead of writing so I set timers for every minutes and it actually really helps me focus better because oftentimes the alarm goes off and I just set it again immediately because I m in the middle of a flow or if I have zoned out and picked up my phone I stop and put it down and go back to my work and I ve become a lot more productive in that way I also make sure that I take a lunch break for at least minutes and then go back to my work and setting these alarms so that my brain s not constantly thinking about what time it is really helps me accomplish what needs to be done so that I m not thinking about it at the end of the day yeah I ve been writing down the goal for the whole week knowing what your objective is like my long term goals this week I speak out loud to another writer I say like I want a draft of this done and I want to put my notes on the page for this other thing and the girl tells me her plans for that week too so like if you don t have a friend have a journal write it down and then have your daily goals as well so that you and those daily goals need to get you to yours is more inside work you could flop this though oh I m saying like yeah for outside of work like my goal this week is to reach out to five people on on Bumble that I like and talk to them for minutes every day right so but like setting those things on your schedule writing your goals down setting a timer like oh I decided I was gon na go on Bumble at like five o clock in the afternoon I m gon na go on Bumble at five o clock because I ve set a timer to go off to do so yeah and it s interesting because rela like you re looking for a relationship I like this is kind of a sidebar but I was watching this video about like a friendship recession and it s basically just talking about how loneliness is so bad for you and I think because people get so comfortable like scrolling on social media they re not like out there making real friends or real relationships it s harder to like Forge uh romantic relationship or even a friendship because it takes work work on both sides like both people have to like continue to invest and put yourself out there and it puts you in this vulnerable position because if I m as an adult being like Oh like let s hang out let s hang out it s vulnerable because I m like wanting to hang out because I need a friend or I need to find a relationship but I think for this woman like you have to prioritize like maybe being a little uncomfortable as well outside of work to find that better more fulfilling life and I did yeah I thought it was interesting that he was just saying like loneliness is so stigmatized and loneliness is also so damaging on your health like to the point that it could be the equivalent of smoking cigarettes a day yeah I think it s like for me it s a it s a mind it s a mind shift so I used to think if I prioritize my professional goals I will achieve them but then you realize like wait once I achieve these dreams what does your life mean what is my yeah like what what does that matter so I I think of it in terms of like the apocalypse right the world ends tomorrow I can t do my job anymore because nobody needs me to what do I have then to live for in my life and for me the honest answer is the group and community of people I have around me like I look at all my laundry list of A A homies and I m like damn I love these people and if I couldn t do what I love that I find to be a part of my purpose every day I would still be satisfied trying to survive with these people I d say you more than most people have a lot of close friends I just love people I love these people mostly I m like why do you guys like me like you re so great I don t know I do love I do I love my friends yeah yeah yeah um so this was kind of going off last week which is why I picked it but she just said I would really love to hear your general advice on developing your communication skills whether it be in romantic relationships or friendships I ve noticed that Lizzy is genuinely very good at communicating when you re having deeper conversations uh she says kind of uh she says the kind of lines a therapist would talk about I m someone who finds it difficult to set boundaries or point out if someone has hurt my feelings I m worried it would be A A and sensitive of me oh thank you for that comment I that s I I use a lot of slogans that I hear from other people so I m just regurgitating stuff that s smarter more well adjusted people have said to me um but I do think that you need to first uh make it okay for yourself because I used to be in really damaging relationships where I had no boundaries and my emotional secure I valued my emotional security as less than those around me and I would compromise my comfort to preserve somebody else s Comfort well if like honestly I have less super close friends because I have such a high standard for myself and I think that has come over time being like I am in a lot of ways communicative of when something doesn t sit right with me when it doesn t feel good and I think you reach an age where you re like I can t deal with all the A A yeah and I do think you also have to if you care about someone in your life you need to be constantly communicating with them and learn how they respond to the world how they respond to you how how sensitive they are how they communicate like that was a big hurdle in shanini s relationship we process things things and information so different for so for us if we had an argument to get on the same page we really had to learn how to communicate effectively with one another because even if I m screaming something at him that I think is so blatantly clear he s not receiving it in the same way that I m giving it so it is about like caring about the people in your life enough to learn how to communicate with them yes and also acting in a way that you have to believe that your boundary is not a problem because it s not having boundaries is not a problem expressing your boundaries is not a problem if you re doing it appropriately screaming a boundary is not appropriate being out of control emotionally and expressing a boundary is not appropriate the point is that you it can be scary because you think that because you re afraid of losing someone you re afraid of offending someone you re afraid of all these things but then you re living your life motivated by fear and when you re doing that you re just going to find yourself constantly taken advantage of because nobody and people might not be intentionally taking advantage of you but you ve never made clear your needs in a situation so the first thing you have to accept is that it is normal and fair for you to have boundaries and needs and that your emotional security is of value and your emotional security does not impact somebody else s it is hard to create a boundary with somebody who you ve never had boundaries with though like oh well absolutely I ve had relationships where people would be like Lizzy you don t have to do that and I d be like yes yes I do I I have to do that and it s like well no the A A you don t like you re not in a back in a black like a dark alley someone doesn t have a switchblade to your throat your anxiety is telling you that because you re in a toxic relationship with somebody who s not treating you right and losing that relationship is okay and they re not comfortable losing bad relationships and there s going to be some turmoil if you have you ve always done like bent over backwards for somebody and then you just one day stop like if you don t tell them like hey I ve really decided like I need to create like some boundaries for myself because I m not feeling healthy in my own personal life so I need to make sure I m taking care of myself if you don t have a conversation like that and all of a sudden you stop they are going to be like what yeah and I think that the people who ask what and hear that you re trying to set boundaries and change your life and uh applaud it great the people who aren t okay with it let them go you re not gon na if you have to convince somebody that your emotional security is a value they re never going to value your emotional security that person has got to go but I m also saying like you kind of have to inform people like oh I m setting this oh absolutely because they re going to be like well I ve walked all over you for years and now you re just ghosting me it s like oh and it s and it s not about the other person s response to it it s about you taking back your power you only have power if you articulate it I am not going to pick up my phone after PM I know that in the past I ve been available at that time that don t that no longer works for me I will take all business calls before pm and none after yeah you have to say it these people aren t going to infer it and you also you can t be that s you not acknowledging the power of your emotional value so if you re not going to articulate it No One s Gon na A A know about it you re still living in fear because you re not communicating it you have to openly communicate it agree that it s okay and important to do so and do it in a coherent non explosive way because when you re exploding nobody hears it anyway yeah amen sister my head hurts so bad bro all right well let s all go take on the world and I hope you enjoyed today s episode of the podcast we ll be back here next week make sure you re following all of us on Instagram by the time this goes live Shane has a new main Channel video out Lizzy has a new

here we are indeed shall we introduce ourselves i guess so because we forget almost every other episode hello hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the sip i m ryland adams of course joined by elizabeth home okay welcome back oh so lizzy did some crazy girls A A she s a jet set she is a actual jet setter like yeah we were supposed to record this episode in california but you got

sound of a A A swallow through a straw good lord that s enraging apologies audios um so i went up north of my best friend and her entire family including my goddaughter lily who s the biggest chunk of monk and she had her first flight it was her very first it was her very first flight and she was a really good girl the whole time did she cry no she s not verbalizing yet right she does a couple of funny things so she s like she talks like a dolphin kind of like like which is really funny like haley s always tripping because she s like shouldn t she be like babbling like that and she s going it s the funniest thing so we ll all just sit there for like minutes look back at her like we re a couple of A A idiot dolphins but she s a she s an er not a babbler um but she came like right off the plane and like reached her arms open for me and like smiled like she knows who the A A i am well she watches you every each and every week on the set she does and we watched the sip with each other which was uh funny and weird and uh you know we had a fondue party baby s first fondue party with cheese or chocolate or whatever she didn t have any of that did you did you get the video no of course not oh my god it s so cute i ll send you the asset because it devastates me but hold on here it is Music so she can t fondue no she can t find you but we found dude anyway she attended the party and she was a pleasure to be around so that was super A A cute and really fun really fun really fresh and then haley stayed in livermore and her husband flew back with the baby and i flew back the same day so i was able to like help him and it was so fun being in the airport and having people like see this beautiful baby and be like mama you did good and it s like i m not her mama but i didn t correct them because i m a A A creep so then lizzie gets home and comes to colorado for one day she flew in this morning to record some podcasts and she s flying out tonight she wouldn t even hang out with me and go to the local festival called parker days you know i m dying to go to parker well you could have spent the night and we could have stayed there all night i missed my puppy blacking out on delicious food and going on sketchy amusement park roller coasters but you wanted nothing to do with me they don t have roller coasters there they have like a A A ferris wheel there s nothing i trust less like i m already afraid of roller coasters that were built to be in one place yeah traveling roller coasters or rides yeah swings i i have to question the validity of the safety of a traveling ride who s running it like locals in each town s teenagers what s ironic is i drove by yesterday and the ferris wheel it s like they re sponsored by a local hospital and it s like of course they are because the hospital s making all the money back the accident with the injuries Music but we did have a fun breakfast at our favorite A A cafe heritage shout out today i had the breakfast burrito with the queso on it like my god begging the owner to move to los angeles i think he should did you have a good flight in no absolutely not i did not have a good flight in i don t it s it s so strange it s like we were talking about the other week A A be coughing up a storm and they re like wet coughs well i was i was reading some of the comments on the last one and they said a lot of people that smoke weed just have a smoker s cough and that these are old A A people that look like they re colorados i i don t know no offense no offense people from colorado but here s the deal y all got some wet ass coughs and put the like pulling the mask down to cough that s pulling the mask down to cough what i know why are you wearing a mask if you re gon na pull it down to cough of all things i told you and we flew on southwest because it s uh unassigned seating yeah oh my gosh i ve never felt worse for flight attendants in my entire life because it s a free for all zoo once you get inside that aircraft yeah and everyone is so rude everyone s trying to fight for their lives to get a seat next to whoever they want to sit next to and it is just a zoo but we were watching uh real housewives of beverly hills and when the ladies they all like took a girls trip together and when they landed they started clapping yeah and shane looked over to me and he said are they clapping because they survived the flight and i started thinking yeah that s really dark when you think about it because often when you re on planes people start clapping when you land i think part of it could be an excitement for a destination in colorado it s definitely like oh we A A thank god oh we didn t crash because that turbulence is crazy coming over those rocky mountains is bonkers terrifying i m so glad i know about it because if i didn t i d be like turning my phone off airplane mode sending my goodbyes to joe but i started thinking about other scenarios in which i clap after it s been done and it s always sucks no i ve never done that out of applause for myself that was the best performance of my life shane you re welcome but the other place i do it is in a yoga class when like collectively the energy is right right and yeah everyone starts clapping yeah and i told jane i was like well it s not just airplane rides it s also when we have a fantastic yoga class the community comes together and collapse and he s like that s A A weird it s honestly not though we do it at orange theory when it s a good class really yeah i ve done it at camp with matthew people clap give yourselves a hand you showed up for yourselves today is it instructed but i m talking not instructor prompted just like i think no everybody goes i think it s instructor prompted i think you re not hearing the instructor no in yoga no no no no are you sure it s never because sometimes i ll be if i was like it s just spontaneous clapping i ll just all start the clapping because you re like wow we just went through that and achieved that together but when shane looked over at me he said i would never finish the elliptical you re starting the clapping yeah sometimes does anyone else i mean i didn t start the clap before it was something out of the norm like somebody else started the clapping in a different class but in my years of yoga now yeah i ll start the clapping for the instructor if i thought she served a A A class and it really got me going i ll start the clap for that A A or him or her i don t know but i don t feel like A A is a unisex okay i just thought it was interesting because then yeah shane was like that s A A weird and then he said i would never finish the elliptical and start clapping well that s because it s an independent yeah yeah but interesting nonetheless i do love on set when somebody is wrapped for like picture wrapped meaning they re done shooting their role and they won t be back the ad always goes that s a picture wrap on so and so whatever just goes ape A A like like it s my A A favorite and i love a picture that makes a little more sense because it s a performance right something that is more in the norm but i i agree with you it is very fun and i don t know i think clapping must release some sort of serotonin because i saw the cutest thing on instagram which was just this dog like throwing your dog a spontaneous surprise party and they just come in from going into the bathroom and all the people that live in the house come around and they just go yes yes and the dog s like A A yeah dude they just get so excited and it s the cutest A A i ve ever seen like the whole body of the dog is wiggling like both different directions it s everything i mean yeah you re gon na have to start doing that to potty train your puppy we do do that oh my god all the dogs get treats when he does it on his pad every single one of them you get a treat and you get a treat you get a treat yeah but that also creates a disaster like my parents dogs because they treat potty trained them now my mom s full time job after p m is the animals psyching her out to what they like go to the door yeah and they annoy you to go to let you to tell you they re not going out but they re only going out to come back and get a treat and then they try it every minutes until my mom goes to bed and she goes okay no more treats after six months that is so funny because they re trained that they get a treat if they go outside i love that for videos so you ve got to cap that well that s like jelly going to the kitchen to check on the food she s like yeah it s all here should we taste it should we taste this it s three o clock in the morning i just want to make sure this food s not going bad jelly last night i was telling you on the way in jelly last night gets out of bed she goes we should go check the kitchen and i m like A A A A i got ta be up at five like do we really go do we got ta go check the kitchen right now she s like we should really go check the question so i was like okay girl let s go check the A A kitchen like maybe she has to go potty and like i ll never risk it but this is how manipulative she is she s learned that she can fake potty so we ll go to the kitchen i m like oh A A let s go back to bed we re going back to bed and she goes no no you re right i have to pee i should pee so she goes out goes fake pee comes back she s like still in the kitchen like i think we should check the food i m like we re not checking the food you fat A A so then we re like she goes over and she s like no i m thirsty you re right i just needed some water she drinks all of the puppy s water that s her new thing she s obsessed with finishing the puppy s water do your dogs not have collective water no because he doesn t have all of his shots so we don t want them sharing water so she has a water he has a water and whenever she finishes his water i have to clean his bowl and refill it with water so she finishes his water and then he comes out of the bedroom so then he pees on the rug then he pees on the rug bubs comes out of the bedroom all of a sudden it s the three of us in the kitchen check in on the food and then i go back to bed and then all of them need to be slightly touching me so i m literally sleeping like i m in a sarcophagus like with my arms crossed against my chest like this like i don t lose circulation and jelly is pressed against my back so i m sleeping a little bit like this bubs is pressed against my chest and the baby now sleeps in the crook of my neck with his face on my face and where s joe who s joe i had to leave the bedroom this morning because yesterday shane s had like a little bit of i don t know if it s seasonal allergies or what it is but he s having like a lot of congestion yeah so because of the congestion he was snoring well he s not used to colorado yeah and when you fly back and forth it s like the altitude really does mess with you and so he was shane doesn t snore but this violently woke me up so i kept kicking him i was like kicking him because he was waking me up and i i also had to be up to do things and so finally after like he would fall i d kick him he d stop snoring and then you kick him two minutes later he d start snoring again so i d kick him again and i i thought he was so asleep he didn t recognize that i was kicking him why are you kicking him we re not just like a little hey baby because i was a little baby so i was A A kicking him and i was like he can t he doesn t know i m kicking him he s asleep and then once he wakes up he just thought he was woken up and then like on the sixth kick he goes why are you kicking and i was like oh justice for shane i didn t think i d ever get caught kicking and so then i just had to wake up at am when i wasn t ready to be awoken but then so this morning he came to bed at a m and i was like i m not getting up right now and he goes well you could go to the other bedroom and so i got my ass up after trying to fall asleep for minutes i took my ass to the guest bedroom because i couldn t handle it guest bedroom s looking real cozy i am a little sad i m not sleeping in it tonight that bed looks warm and welcoming girl i am so tired i traveled with my pillow because i was like i m gon na need to sleep there and back with with the amount of people coughing i don t know if it s appropriate to travel with a pillow oh it was a bad choice it s always about you you ve got ta find that pillowcase no i m just gon na wash it i m just gon na wash it i m gon na take it off when i get did people look at you funny i m sure they did because i also took that pillow in the A A bathroom which oh which brings me to this point when back to workout classes when you re you know how they re like hold a squat for as long as you can i m like i A A can t hold the squat i could go up and down but i can t hold a squat i can hold a squat for so long i learned today having to pee in that A A airport bathroom i held that squat for damn near seconds and what are you doing with your pillow i was holding the pillow in front of me so i have a weight i m hold i m holding away it s a weighted squat and i m squatting to pee and i d held the p so long that i kind of had to force it and i was just shocked by how long the stream was and how violent the stream was the entire time because you know i pee hard be hard to go home so what s your uh what s your beef with southwest it s actually not a beef it s a life hack oh yeah so i i think i miss i didn t explain to you properly what happened last week no i don t think you talked to me about it at all on monday i believed i was leaving from the podcast to get on a plane you need to be better at managing no no this is what s confusing this is what i can t i can t i can t i i did have a flight on monday but i wasn t supposed to that was the miscommunication i booked my flight and it s southwest so you know there s like that the three tiers right like wan na get away cheap A A A A cheaper A A A A i m always the cheapest A A option you know what i mean like give me that dollar fare like i will board the plane last i will hold on to the wing i don t give a A A it s a minute flight i don t care so i m i m on the cheapest A A flight option and i A A up my flight because i was walking that s the other thing i walked to the airport i parked my car at the studio that we shoot the educational videos at and then walked the minutes to the airport because why not i haven t been working out i needed it but then i get i m like i thought it was all so funny because that s like i m walking to the airport like this is a funny thing like this is weird so i sent a picture to haley and i was like welcome to the airport and she calls me she goes why i go what do you A A mean why to meet you in oakland and go to papa s house she s like no dude we re going tomorrow so i m like well A A it i just go into the kiosk and i was like hey guys i really A A this A A up i m going to need a flight for tomorrow at the same time and they re like absolutely no problem wow no problem in and out five minutes then on wednesday when i decided i didn t want to fly home i just called southwest and i was like listen guys like i want to extend my stay like i d like to fly home on friday and said they re like absolutely no problem so why on god s green earth would anybody ever buy a ticket that s better than the cheapest A A option when you can fly whenever the A A you want once you buy a southwest ticket well i think they do that across the board if it s the business class or not the business class but that s what is the business class on a southwest flight it means that you get to be like eight through ten one through ten meaning you get to board the plane first and choose your best seat i guess that s just not something i value well are you you re traveling alone though like if you were traveling with joe no you need to sit next to joe i don t mix the job anymore one time we like begged people to let us sit next to each other and then on the descent he started vomiting and i was like don t know this guy do not know he started vomiting yeah i was so gnarly he was vomiting in the throat back and i just turned away well you guys i can t do vomit oh i don t do that that s not something i A A with you give and you take with southwest it s a zoo but you can rearrange your flight yeah at any time and sometimes you get really lucky and it s not a full flight and i ve been more often than not in my own room okay well speaking of your home you named your puppy like this is i can t believe you didn t lead with this oh now you re wafering well is it wafering or waffling i don t know we re thinking about going uh in on icky an icky yeah icky boy icky nasty boy i like the nickname he s my icky cause icky yeah hey icky i don t think so i i do because listen respectful jelly bubs and nicky oh i love it and icky the other name that we were kind of thinking about was sammich these so you re trying to be a kardashian and name like your children something crazy no icky is short for icarus okay because he s he s constantly just like just like jelly like there s something about a french bulldog that just knows you re not gon na let it fall so he s constantly just doing crazy A A A A and we re always like catching in midair like jesus like so he s like a little bit like icarus like he s just too A A bold just like soaring too close to the sun and crashing and burning but we always catch him so icky icky home okay all right i mean if that s what you want to do why do you hate it i just don t like it icky is like what would you call like i guess there s like a tick tock trend of like what gives you the ick and i feel like it s not that it s not icky it s icky short for icarus and what is icarus i can t get into it it s it s the guy who flew too close to the sun and his wings burned up and he crashed and burned it s like a lesson it s like a lesson story an ancient lesson story you don t want to teach the class i just told you the story do you think the whole class already knows yes i do oh wow yeah oh well it s like mentioned in like a lot of songs too like i don t know like it s a very big part of like everybody knows the story of icarus like it s like you know it so much that you can t really tell it but like in your body you know okay what it means his name is icarus and his nickname is icky yeah i guess yes okay he s a cutie boy i was thinking like i don t know i do like sandwich but i don t like calling for him for sandwich i do like calling him icky it doesn t feel solidified yet it s hard like because i think he i think i m just calling him baby or tiny boy little boy tiny king and the boys have no james is calling him little man and A A i did think A A was funny they re all nicknames though those aren t like name names you can call him that right but like mr bubs isn t a name name i guess you re right yeah okay there s no rules no no yeah that was also a five month long naming process and that s because we couldn t come up with a name so we ll see we might be in that wagon but i do think it s icky okay i like icky i think it s super cute all right well let us know what you guys think of this yeah sound off in the comment section below we re not doing beans we re not doing peanut butter we re not doing marshmallow stop saying this who said that everyone in the comments yeah on my instagram oh did you ask what you should name him i did oh i did thank you thank you for the submissions and sorry for being ungrateful i m gon na go with icky and stuff i think it s cute i don t think it s not cute yes you do you said i hate it that was the first thing you said and just then that was like the lightest lie i ve ever seen it s like trying to be polite but also getting off the subject well yeah i was thinking i could dissect our fight the other week because it was something i never got to wrap around because we we did a virtual episode right after what had went down and it was i felt you conned me in my time when you sold me on a good time and so here s the thing if you have a bff i think that communication is key and i apologize to you lizzy has been going through a lot right so i want to be like a good supportive friend and she was saying the dole whip that we had experienced at six flags magic mountain was all that was giving her purpose and joy and a sense of uh lightness throughout the dark time in her life these are facts and so we discovered that there was indeed dole whip near my house in california and she was like oh my gosh after the podcast let s have a date let s go have some fun let s like go out there and live our lives i did say that and so i was like perfect let s go get dole whip let s go get some lunch let s have some fun i said yes to all of that and then we leave recording the podcast lizzy has still sold me on the idea i m like all right we re going and i get in the car and we park we drive separately because the first red flag should have been she goes well i have to drive separately because it s already like on my way home so we ll just meet there and i go oh okay and then and then we get there and i was like oh we i m starving i don t want to do dessert before i do lunch and she goes well i don t have time for lunch and i was like what do you mean you don t have time for lunch i can t jump right into the dessert i m not like that kind of girl like i don t want to spoil my appetite experts would say i conjure into things so then we get to the place that sells the dole whip and i was like well i m just not going to do it because i i have to eat lunch it was like p m and i was starving and she goes okay i ll get two to go and i was like what and you re like yeah i ll get two to go and i was like oh you see you re getting them for joe yeah and you have to go home so they don t melt and that s it so they don t know no no it was because i can t leave joe alone with jelly for that long and then i m like well can we just get food quickly and she goes well no i have to pick up the boys jersey mics on the way home we do do jersey mics on mondays that is the thing i do for the boys but i apologize to you i drove all the way out of my house and then we got in a scream fight in the parking lot where there s a parking attendant because he s charging everyone for parking and i m like you caught me out of my time i don t even think i had an argument i think i was just shouting to shout because i do love a public screaming match and i didn t even realize how loud we were it was like playfully fighting but we were both screaming like it was interesting because we were across the parking lot they were screaming at the top of our legs which i love doing and then i saw the parking attendant looking at us and i said oh we need to stop oh he was looking at us of course it s embarrassing we were screaming uh see you know i think when you re having a nice scream fight in public that s nobody s business like it s like when you scream and cry in your car nobody can hear it if you re having a screaming fight in public nobody can hear it um but that s i texted you i said listen you re right i bamboozled your sweet little ass into accompanying me to sloanes because i was afraid to go alone for obvious reasons she couldn t find it by herself she didn t know i know where it is no i don t think you do i ve been i went there to pick up some apples one time weird no caramel apples they re like the only place that has good caramel apples okay what are you doing now well i had a follow up on last week because we were talking about pride week and target and yeah they really go all out for pride yeah and somebody in our comments really shook me to the core why because they said i went to a target near my house for years in search of a simple pride flag you know what they told me our only the targets in major cities carry pride stuff is that the end of the comments she said it shouldn t be optional i find it annoying that they only support it now years after it was important and relevant for them to care i just find it fascinating how big their pride campaign is but business is still business being that like in small towns where they know nobody s gon na buy the skus there s no setup of pride material yeah it just confirms that it is a transaction it s not like oh we target are the most prideful people in the world well even beyond that you see who these companies support financially and more often than not it s people who are anti gay rights and when i say anti gay rights i mean like people who don t recognize gay marriage is something that should be legalized legal yeah and that s pretty A A wild but they ll take your money honey yeah i mean and this isn t even just to like A A on target because like everybody it s most corporations that do it i understand a business model like why would you in like a super a town that s uh against like legalizing gay marriage why would you put skus on your shelf that are just gon na go bad well i do know why because if you re outwardly projecting that message you should still outwardly you should actually project the message but they re not projecting a message they re they re looking for sales and their business so i understand but it just validifies what i was saying and why i hate the capitalization of pride yeah which then makes me go icky or what s the dog his name is icky but it gives you the egg it gives me the there s a difference between it so have you been seeing the icky on tick tock or what gives you the ick i just heard about it yeah so what what gives you the egg you you clapping for yourself at the end of a A A yogurt no i m clapping for the collective right but are you yes i am because a few weeks ago you were upset that the collective might be a little bit more skilled at yoga than you oh do you have anything that makes you anxious that shouldn t make you anxious like unrealistically anxious everything or you should like everything well me specifically like i i realized how crazy this trait was when i was leaving this house for california what was just going to be nasty to you i bet you have a lot of things that are absurd that make you anxious because sometimes i sit here very patiently while you re anxious about something i m like what do you mean it s like i don t know it could be as simple as yeah i want to know us in us and not being the exact same size in the frame well no i was like all the oh i was all you could see and it is like if you flew all the way to colorado i think that our picture should look pretty i concur so that s like a bad example it s like i can t think of it because it s such a bad a petty situation that i could never consider that i would never assume anybody would have an anxiety about but you re off the richter scale well because i was asking your opinion you re like no i got this not just this i m talking about like this is the only example i could think of because i ve been up since five o clock in the morning well okay i m bringing this to you because i have one of my own i m sure you do is what i m saying i m a A A nutso about my next video whenever it is for whatever it is it s like once i have footage i am like a prisoner of my house because i m afraid if i leave my house the house will be robbed then my footage will be stolen then the project i ve spent to hours on is going to be lost forever so i m making copies on three different hard drives i m hiding the hard drives like one in my bag that i m taking with me hiding you take a hard drive with you of course this is crazy that s what i mean this is a little bit like your childhood ocd it probably is an extension of that for sure but it s also a fear of losing what i have worked on and i m like if i lose this project like i m now emotionally tied to this project especially like the vlogs because i spend so much time and energy caring for the next video that it s like oh my gosh if i were to lose that then like i m going to be destroyed and devastated well it s also a financial loss right so i mean i i guess so that s not how i think about it though it s more so that like i m proud of the video that i m making so like i never feel free until like the video is uploaded onto youtube like i m even like oh i shouldn t go to yoga until the video is uploaded so that i know it s on a safe like cloud somewhere but it s like to such extreme lengths that i need to like have looked into and your posting oh yeah i always posted a yeah a well typically it s yeah the way you just said that like i oh yeah i always posted a yeah even we all always posted a even if it s a branded video my agent will be like when should i let them know the video is going live i m like well of course it never stops the podcast is yeah the vlogs are oh yeah important distinctions different different things still fourteens nonetheless yeah yeah i wish it was always a in the morning that s way too early oh white why do you want cause i m up and i would like to you know watch it okay so do you have anything that you like ruin your life over that s really not the something that needs to be that when i have an appointment that i don t want to go to i i will obsess over it for six weeks in advance and assume it s that day every day like you had to leave the podcast guys the podcast has to be short because i got ta go to my dentist appointment yeah and i literally did not have a dentist appointment for six weeks i have to leave to go to the airport tomorrow every and every A A week for six weeks i got ta go no the dentist appointment is for sure this monday you crazy A A that s what i mean you need to manage your like do you not look at your calendar we re gon na run out of space be right back do i not look at my calendar okay and we re back yeah i live okay i live every day like it s a dentist day and we all should quite frankly y all should be flossing and brushing like the dentist is today and i can t commit to anything to save my life even with a workout class god forbid i could never do the night before i can t commit to that that drives me well because i got ta know like the state the status of my stomach in the morning do i A A before the class start like i can t book an orange theory class if i haven t A A yet like i have to execute what s going on in my digestive system to make sure that i can perform optim optimally at one of these classes i mean you know what my thoughts and prayers are now directed at you thank you it s hard living up in here all right let s get on to some iced tea there s not much of it this week oh really well yeah britney spears getting married isn t much iced tv i m saying the quantity isn t that much i m not saying the quality isn t there did you see her ex husband storming the A A castle i saw the headline what in the A A so i saw some of the live footage of it and he s like hi i m jason alexander i m britney spears s first husband i m storming the castle i was not invited to this i bray like literally what what was he going to do once inside i don t know but the amount of times he told people he wasn t supposed to be there was too damn many and the amount of time it took security to grab his ass was way too many and what s he doing now he s in jail for how long i don t know but they moved him up to napa county on some other charges too because he s spiraling interesting i don t even remember that uh segment of her life jason alexander yeah who is that it was her first marriage i think he s some shady piece of A A guy okay based off of his actions and what else from the wedding was a standout for you uh for me it was drew barrymore selena gomez madonna and was it donatello versace versace had made her designed her wedding was she at the wedding as well there s that picture of like all those women together and paris hilton and i m just like girl and then the weirdest thing is ansel al gore or whatever was he there yes really yes in the background of one of the pictures he s just like A A there and i m like what is this part of me like was wondering like is this part of like an aaa group of friends kind of you know what i mean like because it was such like everybody made sense except for ansel ansel and so i don t even know how to well i think the group of women that she had invited were people that she had felt supported by throughout her conservatorship and i think that they re friends i don t know if they are because drew barrymore she had posted a slide on instagram of kate hudson and drew barrymore saying like these are two women that i always idolized and looked up to and then drew barrymore i guess was recording her show while that was happening and as she was exiting her stage all of the staff was saying drew barrymore did you see what britney spears said and she was like no i need to go collectively like look at it and digest what i want to say back in response because words are powerful and i want my words to be impactful but i was like she wants her words to be impactful so she gets the britney spears interview in my like toxic way of thinking right yeah which i m sure you re such a cold calculated baby sure uh intentions were genuine but i do think that then they connected after that and that is when britney probably extended her invite because drew barrymore s show is filmed in new york city and that s where she lives yeah and so she made a trek out here for this yeah um they all seemed it honestly seemed like such a loving A A aside from the amount of money that i know goes into a wedding and specifically must have gone into that one very down to earth wedding felt no more elaborate than a kardashian child birthday party right honestly like it also it felt more down to earth than a kardashian child s birthday party beautiful like that s not saying it s not beautiful no but it was like stunning but it was in her backyard and it was it seemed like she was having the most authentic time of her A A life and i loved that for her mm hmm i loved her and madonna recreating the kiss she took her pants off for the she took her party pants off for the party was wearing a pink bikini bottom like i m trying not to read into the things that are a little suspicious like what like a panic attack like what her panic attack oh i don t think that s suspicious i mean i guess i had a panic attack before my wedding uh we were plotting how if joe said no to me at the altar i was like we re all taking our heels off and we re smack we re like gon na stab this A A out of the groom s party and my dad was like don t talk like that and i was like either you re with me or against me ho no i did see and these are just reports i have no true or no uh way to know if these are valid or not but i guess for months they re going back and forth about like the prenup which is normal like you have to figure that out no matter what and money s a tricky thing obviously britney has money to protect yeah um so hopefully they they squared that away but they didn t from what i read they didn t um they didn t write their own vows they did repeat after me vows which i thought was interesting maybe it s because they re like shy and they exchanged words of love and affirmation before or after the ceremony i think it can be a lot of pressure to do that in front of a group of people i don t want to do it yeah but i do think it s like you you guys did your own vows we did both right yeah but it was beautiful the gown was beautiful it looks like fun was had all around i had fun scrolling through all of the photos of the unexpected guests selena gomez was such a weird crazy weird advice i wish i was invited i honestly wish her the best and i hope that everyone had fun and i hope that the people that did show up for her can be positive impacts on her life or people that she can call uh if she needs guidance in any direction because i m sure a lot of people try to take will try to once she re enters the working world i m sure a lot of people will try to take advantage of her like contractually or you know i just hope she makes like smart business decisions because like i don t know how to like read a contract so i just hope she has like a good lawyer around her and with all these other powerful women in the industry hopefully they also have great advice for her and like making boss business woman moves hell yeah and i hope she s on stage again soon i love nothing more than her vegas show yeah i think she said she was gon na chill for a little bit yeah as she should yeah but i mean if she wants to work again i will be lined up at that vegas residency i wish that wasn t your and shane s thing because i d be like let s go you can go with me i would go back to back to back i d love that for us so britney spears got married and then there s the scream movie drama yeah so nev campbell uh sydney prescott the sydney preschool the face of the entire franchise had announced that she was backing out of being in the next installment of the franchise because she felt what they had offered her financially was not in line to what she had they offered her less money than she had on previous films which is A A wild a punch to the gut i mean i understand that they re bringing fresh blood in and maybe she s no longer the star of the movie but she still is the driving force in what made she s the franchise successful yeah she is the mother of the franchise and how A A dare you even if she s making a cameo she you don t A A reduce her her pay yeah you just can t do that with the last one being a hit financially i just can t fathom that they wouldn t meet her halfway because i m sure there was a lot of back and forth and pushing for a minimum of what she wanted and then she finally had to stand up for herself which is like gut wrenching to walk away from what was probably the biggest success of her career i don t know that that s true but it s a huge i don t know it s a huge culture scream it s iconic and it s like to walk away from the franchise that s a big deal like i i don t know if i would be able to be like i might take the pay reduction to be a part of something but then you have a bitter taste in it but that s the whole thing with your your your pay once you drop it then that s your quote yeah because yeah in the film industry you have a quote yeah that like that s why a lot of traditionally movie stars didn t like to do tv or if you do a tv guest star you can t just accept a lower rate because then that s your rate yes whatever the lowest you ve last accepted um she had a few people uh stick up for her um who was it matthew lillard he was in the one of the first ones was he invited back for this next one no he s dead his character is dead oh spoiler alert when did he die last in the last one no in the first one he was the killer in the first one see and i just rewatched these movies and i m like who s that well i don t know he s really dude okay um and he was just he spoke out about it and said that yeah he was like good for her it also makes me think about the first movie where A A sid punches gail in the face because goes like i ll send you a copy and then like they re all laying around and rose mcgowan is like recreating and she s like i ll send you a copy bam A A went down i ll send you a copy bam sit super A A and it just makes me think like that s her like sucking this franchise in the face like you just made a A A ton of money pay the woman her worth i agree also in re like now with all of this going like hella public you should really pay her it s not too late to make a counteroffer i m not saying she has to no no but you better make that counter offer and you better do it in public because we hate you now the fandom is A A pissed they are i ve saw i ve seen a lot of people posting on their instagram stories yeah enraged about this uh jamie kennedy also weighed in saying how can you make scream without sydney uh saying it s crazy that people aren t paying money to the literal face of the franchise yeah my question is like courtney mama where are you at like she s not she s not being outspoken about it well i don t know to my knowledge i haven t seen her be she might be behind scenes and i don t think it s anyone s responsibility to leave their role if they re satisfied with their pay for another person but i would like to well that s like collective bargaining like that s how you everybody succeeds and that s why like unions are important because if if we re a unified front and we want more money if we both threaten to walk we re both more likely to get the money the problem is they re probably negotiating it s not like a tv show that s going on it s not like friends that happens more on tv shows but you know a franchise is like i would still hope that behind closed doors there s people in this current cast that are vocalizing their distaste for this decision i don t know i bet courtney s probably i m this is all speculation i bet she s happy with her pay because she s like i i can t imagine do you think they re offering courtney more than they offered sydney because she is courtney cox i don t know but i ll ask her at the next crossroads event just kidding their kids graduated i ll never see her again courtney honestly i don t fault her for like it s not her like it s no one else s has to step down because because neve did i just think nev sorry god damn oh my god whatever you know what gives me irrational anxiety you could speak names yourself um hayden panettiere will be in the next movie though which i think is yeah uh which i think is a saving grace for a lot of people like i think yes uh people are gon na be pissed that nev isn t in it but i think people really hayden was a fan favorite so i think people will be like oh well i do want and maybe that s what the producers thought is like well we have hayden coming back and she was a fan favorite so maybe we don t need to pay it s also A A up that would be the dumbest producer thought process you guys okay should we get into some advice though sure all right uh this first one was a submission asking am i the A A okay so first of all i love you guys so my mother passed away unexpectedly last year and i have been living in her home for the past five years she has she has lived elsewhere during this time we had a verbal rent to own agreement with our lawyer but nothing official yet i have two sisters when mom died she did not have a will my sisters decided that they would not honor the agreement i decided to try to buy the home i worked with a lender and got my credit up and did this all in less than a year finally we are at the end uh close to closing on the house and i find out that the home needs ten thousand dollars in repairs so i offered to pay for it to take a cut out of my third of my inheritance and they would not lose any of their share her siblings they have just informed me that they have decided not to sell the home to a cash buyer so that they can get more money out of it i feel bullied and ganged up on and just stressed i have uprooted my life it s possible i may lose my dogs i have a rash all over my body i m just so mad and done with them both so am i the A A because i want to walk away from the relationship i feel like now that mom is gone and i m on my own i can t fight them so i guess i will cut them out of my life uh any advice is appreciated i thank you for taking the time to read this oh that breaks my A A heart i don t know what it is but there is something about uh death of a person who s like one of the matriarch or patriarchs of a family that really makes everybody lose their bananas and i m so sorry you re going through that it s not it you would think at times like this families would rally around each other and more often than not you hear about people disputing wills or verbal agreements or what have you money s nuts it really A A is it really is and it doesn t seem that the other two sisters had an interest in buying their mother s home rather they wanted to get a bigger paycheck for the home so that their inheritance would be larger yeah um it s sad to me that you guys couldn t get together and verbally work this out yeah it s also like i hear a lot of people saying money could really change my life and the fact of the matter is it can t you can change your life when you change yourself on the inside and you can have money and you can still be a miserable piece of A A and i have found that most people who like come into money really quickly get out of money really quickly and they re still left at the rock bottom pitiful A A place that they were before nasty and upset because karma s a A A and if you re not well on the inside money s not going to make you well on the outside i know that for a A A fact and you spend it really quick the hard thing is to rationalize with the people that are your family doing that to you i think if you if i don t know if this has been solidified that you re not getting the house but i do think that maybe this is the world s world and giving you a blessing who knows what kicking you although it s going to be very sad to have to leave that house it might be a healthy fresh new start for you and it might open up doors that you never had imagined i would honestly as mad as you are with your family try to sit them down and come to a place that you guys can collectively be together because there is nothing more special than like family and if you can salvage your relationship with uh your sisters i feel like you should try to do so but if they re just not willing to come to the table in any regard i think i know i it s like you know everybody s hurting right now and money is a hell of a drug and i do think that what ryland said stands sitting down and with brutal honesty about your emotional pain in regards to the situation might be really helpful like pull all of your anger out of the moment and just express yourself honestly like listen ladies this is what i ve been doing this was the agreement i had with mom i am devastated at the way that this is transgressing i if it s true if you love them i love you both my family means more to me than this you re not the A A for wanting to walk from the situation mental sanity is worth more than the money you re gon na get from this property so if if you need to walk walk that doesn t make you an A A but if you feel the relationship with your sisters is valuable and worth saving like if they re not like the wicked stepsisters of cinderella have the talk if they re the wicked stepsisters of cinderella A A that yeah it would just be a bummer because you don t i mean losing i can t imagine losing a parent and i would imagine it would be better to go through that with people you share memories with like i think i hear a lot of people when they get older and even like my grandma when like people she knew started passing it s like well a par a portion of you starts to go too because now you have no one to uh remember your memories with yeah and so i think if you can salvage the relationship it would be good and find the root of why they think they re being slighted by you as well yeah um because if it s the difference of ten thousand dollars or that they re going to make a little bit more money on the house maybe you could give a little bit more of your inheritance if the house means that much to you like if they re like oh well we have an offer for grand over maybe the grand that you could take out of your inheritance would be worth it because like lizzie says if the house is so important to you the money s not really gon na matter at the end if the house is a home for your forever life um but i i know a saying like go talk to your family it s like oh it s hard and it s scary but like more often than not i find being honest about your emotions as opposed to being angry and punitive gets you really far well you also make up i m not saying you but like people if you don t address something with someone you start to craft narratives as to why the other person is doing something i think it s natural human behavior like if i have like a little tiff with someone in my life and i don t just address it i start going down the rabbit hole of like assuming what they re thinking which got them to this point yeah and then i feel like i build a story in my head that s not even accurate oh it s awful had i just gone to them and they d be truthful to me i didn t spend days or weeks wasting my time thinking about how this person slighted me it s like go directly to the source if you can yeah and just like uh family is so special so i hope that you can make up with them and if it s not too late to try to get the house i would try to go about getting the house in a way that s not like that doesn t seem because doesn t seem selfish to you on their behalf because i think they probably feel slighted in some way yeah please plead your case understand that they re coming from a place of fear and pain and so are you quite frankly fear and pain everybody s in pain everybody s in pain treat everybody as if they are in pain because they are okay our next submission comes from a year old female she says she has been with her boyfriend who s for almost seven years that s a long time she said i m absolutely in love with him and i m constantly dreaming about traveling getting married babies the works we re going away together for the first time since kovid and we decided five days away to paris my roommates have speculated that he plans on proposing and i got really excited about the idea i thought he was going to propose last time we went on a a weekend away in the countryside but obviously it didn t happen i didn t tell him about this and he was surprised to hear how disappointed i was and promised that he will but won t tell me when his mom has already told him that he s not to propose yet because we re too young for that they re and my mom doesn t her mom doesn t see anything wrong with them getting engaged now and leaving the wedding until after they graduate college in two to three years in fact she has informed her boyfriend her mom has informed her boyfriend that she can use uh the engagement ring um that she first got proposed to with so he doesn t even have to buy an engagement ring and she said she can t help agree with her mom um this girl has jokingly said that she d propose to her boyfriend instead but he wants to be the one to do that and he agrees with his mom that they are just too young to get engaged right now so she says a small part of her feels deep down has something he has something planned for the trip and he will propose to her but she doesn t want to get her hopes up for something that probably won t happen so is she crazy for wanting to get engaged at she asks i don t think she s crazy for it but i do think chill out but it s hard because i even remember when you were at a point in your life where you re like joe needs to propose i was how about how long have you had you guys been together like six years and they ve been together seven years i also understand like i do think getting married at like i don t think like but subtract seven from and you re a teenager i know like they re not a young teenager and you re like i think you changed the most in your s yeah so you guys would either get married and grow together or grow apart and that is a gamble for sure so somebody like his mom is just saying like there s nothing uh that you re not taking away from your relationship if you re not getting engaged this moment and in fact if you re and still head over heels for each other get married go for it when i was i was with the guy i had been with for maybe five years and we were talking about marriage all the time we were talking about getting married we were talking about the rest of our lives we were talking about kids and we grew up like people change i m not saying you re going to grow up and grow apart but i am saying quesara sera enjoy the present moment because you can get so caught up in expectation that you miss every beautiful thing in front of you right now and i m saying this because you are and what i struggle with like i agree like if from an outsider s perspective i would say wait but take away the age standpoint being with joe for six years and you re ready for a ring like i m ready for a ring because joe s years older than me and i want a family with kids and i want a family with kids with him and that means it s urgent i m just saying i understand being i understand being with somebody for seven years and thinking it s time like we ve been together for seven years i feel valid in this relationship absolutely i know in my gut this is what i want for the rest of my life i think if he s not meeting you there he either is being cautious or he s not head over heels because i do think had i been in a healthy relationship for seven years at i would get engaged like you can call off an engagement worst comes to worst yeah and and but i also see an engagement as i m i m already making the promise if i m gon na accept an engagement ring it s because i m ex i m going to marry you so it s you know and it s going to happen it s going to happen i know i m just trying not to take away from how she s feeling right now because i oh yeah i totally get it i totally get it i don t know what i m saying i thought shane was going to propose on one of our mexico trips and he felt the vibe too and we got there he s like just so you know i m not going to propose and there was like a little bit of devastation even though i knew it was coming like i knew that didn t mean we weren t getting engaged multiple engagements before i got engaged and so i m just saying like i m not taking away how you feel because it is seven years is a big feat and i do feel if he was as jazzed up about it as you you guys probably would be engaged that s just me because like in utah that is a norm like people get married at they have two kids by and that is their life right and there s nothing right about it there s nothing wrong about it but i would just have a serious serious conversation with him if this means the world to you and as a person who s literally ruined multiple engagement opportunities for myself after not listening to my now husband say chill your bill A A i wish i had chilled my bill after he told me to chill my bill well if his intentions are really that he s like i would talk to him and say like i don t want to waste my time if you don t want to get engaged right now i will come to terms with that but i want to know you re in it all the way it sounds like he is he s saying i m gon na do it yeah so it doesn t seem like she s sure though that he is because i think the actions are what she s seeking and that s not happening yeah oh from my vantage point it sounded a little bit like she she wants it now and she and she doesn t want to wait and that s what she s wanting but i i don t think i i i don t think you re crazy because again like we both had the same A A feelings i think that s totally normal feeling but i am saying to you don t get wrapped up in your crazy enjoy your time enjoy your present tense and when the future comes it ll be your present yeah and if it does work out it s going to be fantastic if it doesn t it s because it wasn t meant to be yeah and yeah i do think it sounds like it s going to work out like it sounds like it s going to work out yeah so just relax i wish you the best if he does propose on the vacation be sure to uh reply to that email so that we know and we can hear how it all went down but no matter what have fun yeah that s really exciting if you re not having fun what are you doing you re coughing on an airplane with your mask down that s what you re doing and even those people probably having fun having a great time because they re not doing it under the restriction of their math they re trying to talk to my baby are we rolling out i can t see that far but does that say it says okay so i have one more that could just be like it s like an appreciation it s a thank you to an advice she says inspired i love you all so much i ve been watching or i ve been a shane fan for so long and have been binging the sip it s my new favorite i wanted to say i graduated nursing school in may of um and she was immediately shoved into the coveted unit i was traumatized and saw things i still have nightmares about i ve been stuck in a toxic work environment taking on way more than i should have to i was working pretty much every weekend and never had time to spend with family i was so miserable that i would dread going to work and cry every night before uh work i thought i didn t have any options and should just stick it out but one morning i was listening to the sip and i heard lizzy talking about toxic work environments and she said if your job is toxic uh you can t let it go uh and you can t let it go when you go home get the A A out she said that same day she put in applications on indeed not sponsored and started her and she started her new nursing job on monday she said it s way better pay it s a better schedule and a much healthier work environment so she just said i love y all and i much i needed that much i needed that push A A yeah dude A A yeah that s what i m talking about it is so much better to go into the discomfort of change than it is to survive forever in something you A A hate and like we were just saying fun is the point like if you re not enjoying it it s not worth it and for this and for her it is like she put herself out there she found a better paying job oh yeah with a better schedule and has a healthy work environment there is and that s the thing it s like if you can dream it go for it yeah if you can articulate what it is you want start reverse engineering it and make it what you have and i love that she didn t quit her job before she got the next one she put in the extra hours got off work when she was miserable and tired and hungry and submitted these applications and got a new one and was able to change her life so it s never too late to change your life with that we re going to run out of time we re going to change our lives i m really just going to change my shirt that s all we re doing and we ll be right back for you it s a whole week um all right you guys thank you so much for watching and supporting our show if you want to follow us on social media we re at the sip official we re also on there personally we love you so much thanks for your continued support we ll see you next week goodbye and that s it also sound off in the comments below if you feel us looking in the viewfinder i don t oh okay i want to know all right i want to know did we seem absent because i was here emotionally and also kind of trying to see myself because i feel like i look like an orangutan the way i m sitting Music you
Music thank you Applause Music thank you oh my gosh you can do that yeah we re rolling oh my gosh hello everybody and welcome back to an on the road episode of the Sip podcast I don t think this has ever been our reality but for those of you who don t recognize me I am Lizzie Gordon and I did not bring any makeup to Las Vegas we didn t bring anything to Las Vegas really which has been a nightmare in and of itself and you know what because this day has been let s be honest a little bit stressed but like we re so blessed we re so blessed we re at the win in Las Vegas right now we re so blessed but like traveling without a plan is low key stressful it s um it s not it s not how it s supposed to be done you know what but I think everything works out for a reason and the girl at least they made it oh well first of all hello you guys Hi how are you another episode of the Sip I m Ryland Adams I already did this of course Jordan Elizabeth I m not even drunk yet I know rylan s having a drink because we ve had a hours to say the least I m gon na take you back to Saturday the th it s P M I get a text message from Ryland fully unhinged saying should we just go to Taylor Swift in Las Vegas tonight I am in Van Nuys California I call him he answers which is shocking well I meant business he meant business I said come get me and he did and he bought Taylor Swift tickets on the day of and came and got me and I booked flights for Spirit Airlines we go to the A A airport they won t let us on the flight they won t let us on the flight because we re not there minutes so Bonkers to me if they re gon na let you book a flight an hour before it takes off and not tell you you have to be checked in minutes before it takes off and then we show up to the gate bright eyed and bushy tailed because we think we re going to Taylor Swift in Vegas that we ve already spent thousands of dollars on tickets yeah I am gon na give this to Spirit though on the off chance they see this after our lawsuit goes through there s probably small print somewhere that says you have to check in and it s that A A where it s just like scroll to the bottom so you can move on to the next frame so anyways they won t let us on that flight then Rylan and I run to Jet sweet X to try and get on another flight and then we realize we don t actually have to Taylor Swift tickets well there s the thing I got it on like a third party ticketing app and I guess the person that actually owns the tickets has to release them to me through Ticketmaster and it s like they didn t they didn t and then I sat on hold for minutes hoping and praying after I booked another airline this is after we already have flight to A A Vegas long story short which you can watch in my friend rylan s Vlogs yeah it will be a very uh it will be something that s for sure it s a A A it s a travel it s a travel channel now who would have thought that I would be a traveling girly you re not traveling early and the person who s been traveling with you I don t think you are a traveling early so because we were jumping right off the plane and going straight to the show we brought nothing we we brought not a thing wild I have never in my entire life jumped on a plane with nothing I didn t even bring a purse because we were going to the concert where I know you can t bring a purse unless it s see through I came with my Vlog camera and I was like Lizzy you better check to see if I can bring this Vlog camera into the Taylor Swift concert and she goes yeah it s chill everybody s been doing it I ve been watching the tick tocks of everyone and it s fine and it s gon na be fine when we get there they re like this is not fine I m like we don t even have a hotel room so like what do you want me to do with it and we had to walk like half a mile we had to walk a lot of walking in Vegas um but we made it we re here you know what everything worked out it was and has been a challenge at every step of the way I think the real challenge is us I think that if you were to like reverse like if you were gon na do like an algebraic equation where it s like X Plus Rylan and Lizzy equals a problem the I m not great at math but we re the common denominator and that s what I m trying to say well I just think while I m not a planner I can t commit to things in the future it was nice to just be like day of having fomo literally like everyone on Friday night was posting their stories and photos from Taylor s concert and I just couldn t handle it and Shane could see I was dying inside and he said just go tonight and I was like I could never and then he said call Lizzy and that s what I did and you know what it all worked out but the thing is like even to get our toiletries let me tell you we wouldn t do a CVS at A A midnight and there was a line around the A A building to get our toiletries that we have since lost do you know what I m thinking to myself champagne problems is exactly what it sounds like as we sit here in the A A coveted ass Taylor Swift merch that nobody can get then we just walked right up to didn t even wait in line for it just grabbed it even everyone in Vegas they see us in our Taylor merch and they re like it s like they re seeing a celebrity how was it oh my gosh was that great I heard the merch line was six hours long and we re like no we just walked right up and I will give up when did you get your tickets for like yesterday no oh the day off yeah I I what did you do we just give us props like Lizzy kept saying she goes on at we got to be there at we got there at eight she went on at like and we we ran into our seats ready to go and looking back at all of the footage and videos that we had taken on our phone like I ve never been more embarrassed to be me in my life oh we re embarrassing people it s like so hard to watch yourself enjoying something that you think you look good doing at the end of the show there was a security guard named Brittany Brittany if you re watching a shout out girl and she came up to me and not people don t like come up to me so in my mind I thought this woman was gon na say hey I was watching you dance all night and you were so cute and she did not say that but she does watch the podcast and she recognized Ryland and she was like I love the podcast but I really thought she s gon na tell me it was a cute dancer and then Rylan was playing back some of the footage of me dancing and it s like stay home and the people next to me like were sitting and like just recording horizontally the whole time and I was like looking back I feel so bad for them because I was screaming at the top of my lungs for the entire concert I was like assaulting the girls next to us because I I m not aware of my body and I m pretty sure I just kept smacking this poor girl in the butt with my phone and I was like I m not really wearing deodorant I m wearing clothes that I had worn all day previous we didn t have time to get ready and all of my clothes were in the washing machine when we went to get on an airplane I don t have an excuse for as filthy as I was I put on no my excuses I put on a hot outfit but can you imagine if that is what I had worn here and I spent all day in A A dirty leather pants and a see through t shirt that reeks so we made it do you want to tell them about your chafing experience oh my God no I recently started chafing and so if anybody in the comment section like wants to like share some like cheap I like didn t believe her almost I was like stop you re fine you re fine and she takes off her pants and they re like right raw and I was like damn girl I feel bad I sent it to my friend Kate and she s like so the concert was good that s how you know so yeah so leave a comment below if you um know how to manage chafing because some of us are new to the shape game and it is painful and so because we re dedicated to be in perfect because we re dedicated to making this a work write off we have decided to record the podcast from well no can we just show them really quickly what s happening no because we don t want to ruin our frame you can do it on your phone if you want but what had happened is like we booked a one way like this was not thought out in any manner whatsoever there were Zero To None flights on our way back today so now we re stuck here another stuck here we re stuck in Vegas another night and we had a whole A A up with rainbow them because I only booked it for one night all the way here and then they cleaned our room out all of our A A that we d spin on all day accumulating because we didn t have any of it we re so stupid but the thing is like in Vegas it s not easy even if you you re on the Strip like walking next door to the next Casino you got ta walk up through down around besides that the A A that we needed was just we just went to two Best Buys and two times I m a dedicated professional I wanted my Vlog battery to be charged for the Vlog camera one Best Buy didn t have it I was like the target will have it the Target didn t have it we go to another Target and then they re like a Best Buy A A five hours away it has it and I was like we re going to Best Buy and the ladies kept being like are you like our Uber drivers were like are you locals and we re like no and they re like why are you I was like I m working and then one of the taxi driver goes oh you guys have been really busy because I like yawned loudly and he goes against your time because you re gon na say cat we ve been really busy like working girls all day and I was like we ve eaten and all I ve done is A A I m done I woke up this morning scared of getting sick from the concert and I had four emergency pumpkins I had four packets of emergency in a water bottle and checked it and then we go to breakfast and I was like I really A A myself and at the time I was just wearing like volleyball shorts from fabletics because I couldn t wear my pants because the chafing was so wrong can I have had diarrhea at every location we went to today and I Googled it and an adult person is only supposed to have milligrams of vitamin C and I have had four thousand and the result of which has died but I also think there s like something with the altitude because normally when I travel I like get stuck I get plugged up for a couple of days and I woke up like it s normally a process like before I can exist as a human I need like an hour to myself to get myself to where I can relieve myself and then it s like good for me to go you have something on your face and is it a pimple I don t know and so this morning I woke up and I was like oh got ta go and I had to run to the bathroom but yeah for some some reason it s a situation here we ve just been A A and eating all day um yeah so that s what we ve been up to so then we go to our oh I m too boring for you no I m bringing up the docket okay uh in one of the Ubers all the way to where were we going Henderson Henderson Lizzy remembers because I m gon na name my son Roy Henderson home okay it seems very succession of you thank you it sounds like one of those names but so we get in the car and like I tell you Lizzy is not socially aware of her being I m not oh this lady like does a curb check like really hard wow like so might I say rude when you re in somebody s car that s driving you and so we get to the location and because we re so far I m like hey like is there any way you direct you don t have to like take the Uber fees I ll just pay you like whatever fee you want direct through venmo or cash right now um to take us back to this trip and she goes as much as I like taking out with you guys I think I just I m good gon na be a hard no for me dog is what she said she did not want to wait for us and we like I was like we know what we re getting we ll be in and out within five minutes which also was alive we were there first quite some time it s probably good she didn t wait for us and the guy back enjoyed us thoroughly so we re fine he did he or was he he confessed that he was falling asleep on the wheel like a few too many times for my personal Comfort because I m gon na have to roll down the window I literally just

and Trust member FDIC well I noticed this morning that you have acupuncture oh uh suction cup marks on your back oh so I m good like my back has since recovered like you don t have to listen to my press tour about my back anymore but on my journey to Healing my back right I like did every La girly thing in the world like I was so desperate because it got worse before it got better and it had been a month so I started panicking I was like is this gon na be like prolonged something that I have to live with now for whoever no like like this is your new idea is this the new me and the new meal was not a good life to live and so I started calling physical therapists I started calling acupuncturists I like went to like four different chiropractors I m like whatever will help me feel back to normal is something that I m gon na do and I had never done acupuncture before and I go there this lady let me tell you she was like giving it was like going to college she to be an acupuncture she had been to like seven years of school and she like did a Whole Health diagnosis before she even did acupuncture she s like do you get headaches where do you get headaches do you get gut aches are you gassy and I was like yes and so she gave me like Solutions like things to problem solve in my diet and the way I m living to like be a better me through Chinese medicine before she even did acupuncture and then like I had never done acupuncture which was like fun and fine could you feel the needles in you I could fill them when she was placing them in there did it sting like what did it feel like you not really she like Taps you it s like a little tube that the needle s in she Taps the tube on your body and then pokes the needle in and then you can t feel that it s in there anymore like you can t even really feel the needle go in and the medi it felt like meditation on a different level it was just like a controlled environment room she like heated it for me played nice meditation music and I did like fall asleep and when I woke up from my like sleeping I felt as though I wasn t levitating but I was light and it was this weird like out of body experience but I don t know if that s because I was super relaxed or because these needles did anything like I m still I m not like dissing acupuncture I just don t think it focuses your energy to the location that it s at no because she so in acupuncture and like sorry I m acupuncture stupid she s showing me that there s like highways on your bodies through your like blood vessels in your veins and stuff and so she s like I know your Pain s here in your back but I m actually going to do all these different spots that will get you put them in your face stuff moving she puts them in my ears some in my neck I think I don t remember all the points but she was like I m gon na like unblock different Pathways because she s like you could have pain in your back but I could be sticking you up here because you could be blocked up here and then that can like help increase your circulation so because I couldn t really fill the needles I don t know like what the needles did I did feel like very relaxed but the cupping which was is something that felt it was was like tangible felt good and I loved it cupping just sucks your flesh so she like put oil all over my back and then she literally just like holds a lighter that s lit inside of a cup and then sticks it on your back and like and I guess what she was saying is it like picks the skin up off the muscle to allow blood circulation to like increase in the areas and she was like some people will just stick them on certain positions and leave them but she was like I like when I m like moving them around and she s like I can really see like how your body recepts based on like where I ll get things showing up like I don t know coloration will show up on some people if it s like a tense area I want that um so it was a great experience and I just felt like I learned a lot about myself through doing all these things I d also never been to a physical therapist and I felt like going to a physical therapist she also gave me like nuggets of information about posture and just like ways that I don t know for some reason I felt like back posture like leaning forward and having an arch in your back was the right way but apparently you re supposed to like have your lower back kind of tucked and flat and then your upper is supposed to have a little bit of a curve okay and so I think that s like a large part I like I realized in my everyday life I m straining my lower back instead of using my like glutes or my thighs in a lot of different positions or even when I m sitting at a desk it s like more comfortable for me to lean forward even if I thought I had good back posture but I mean I just thought it was all like very lag and interesting I mean I want to get a section cupped we should I m well you can t go to acupuncture together I don t think couples acupuncture so that s me I love that you learned things about yourself oh do you want to talk about me hiding being sick crazy I don t think it s crazy what s with you and your family like you guys are nuts I don t think we re nuts that we like our privacy what s with you and your family that you like your privacy I don t like what do you think you re gon na get like less opportunities in life because you came down with a common sickness let me hold on before you answer let me bring them up to speed so every time Lizzie s sick she like won t allow me to tell anyone she s sick whether it be like the podcast audience the internet and like I always forget because in my mind it s like so ludicrous to not be able to like share information with people I mean I guess everything yes but so I went on because we didn t have an episode last week I m so sorry we went to Colorado for our anniversary there s a vlog up on my Vlog Channel about it but and I just felt like it was it was good for us to have a week off and have a moment um and you did get like violently sick so sick within that period so when I was like oh there s no new episode like we were in Colorado Shadow and Lizzy s violently sick and she you were like you did text me and you re like good thing we didn t have an episode because I wouldn t have been able to make it anyways and she was like thanks for putting me on blast and telling everyone I m sick and I was like oh yeah I forgot you re A A crazy and like will not allow the world to know you re sick well to like the full story is I was home alone and I didn t want people who are I didn t tell people you re home alone people might know her just like stalking me and I didn t you need to tell people you re home alone no I tell no one I m home so why would they be like she s sick and Home Alone let s let s move on we might just infer by the tone of your voice no but this is like a recurring theme in your life like you and your husband will not allow no it s not one specific why is it a secret though like that s why I don t want to share vulnerability like I oh like so it shows that your body isn t like we don t get sick home okay don t get sick okay we just don t do it you know why because that s some weak ass A A and our family to the girl who s had covered four times it was like never not having coveted like I probably have covered right now all right what s up what it is what it is A A yeah going to like Vegas is very suspicious right now even we re just like drunk so much vitamin C and that s A A me and then the other part of my brain is like or is this the coven shits who could ever really say the other like I just want to follow up because my Vlog yesterday that came out yesterday about how you failed me in securing Taylor Swift tickets well because opening night in Glendale of Taylor Swift I was at home sick as a A A dog alone Joe s gone James is gone I m just a victim in my house susceptible open vulnerable and I m just watching everybody have the time of their lives at Taylor Swift and I just start like scream crying right in the face scream crying and I call him and I go like I ll buy the tickets right now you just like and you just I need you to tell me you re like I won t the tickets in Los Angeles are in August and he s like I m not gon na be there in August I was like I ll come to Colorado we can do it but then the Colorado tickets aren t until like so far out and like July so I didn t want to commit to tickets and I I was with my family because we were traveling and I was like let s figure this out when I get back to LA because like I don t want to commit to something right now I just like fill in my heart that I m gon na make it to a Taylor Swift concert which is the most annoying thing about this man I feel in my heart that I m gon na make it to a Taylor Swift concert which with no urgency so I spend the entire week A A talking him and scream crying to my best friend about how this A A has no urgency and like I wish we could go to Taylor Swift and she and I are both crying because it s so A A expensive that it makes no goddamn sense it s crazy crazy and then all of this comes to a head where like I m listening to her all week watching her documentary like so inspired I started writing a whole movie like about my girlhood and Adolescence because like Taylor just like gets the queen of juices flowing and I like Joe s finally home from New York and I just run into his him he s taking a shower and I run in while I m listening to fearless and I went I can t A A take it anymore I m getting some A A Taylor Swift tickets and he goes Do It full send it get floor seats so then I drop an absurd amount of money that I don t have to be completely Frank with you this was a reckless expense like if I had children CPS should be calling and I don t understand how you can spend that kind of money when it s so many months out like the fomo of like knowing that everyone else is going to the concert while I m not but I ve spent thousands of dollars to go see her would kill me more than having the ticket and then that settled in for me and so I ve been selling to Joe every day I ve just been like wow am I just supposed to pretend like I want to exist in this reality until A A August and he s like feeling so bad for me which is so pathetic because I ve already secured Taylor since floor seats and for me like whatever so I m tripping the whole time and then so when you called on Saturday I like ran back to Jonas like Ryan I m gon na take me to Vegas right now and to see Taylor Swift and he s like I m so happy for you go A A get him wait here s some cash because I know you re out of money now and we kept questioning like how happy our husbands were for us like the fact that they sent us out with no plans to Vegas just reeks of them like hoping we die because neither of us really knows how to work everywhere people yeah every step of this trip has proved that like we should not be left unsupervised supervised to make our own plans because like we re not well the only thing I pre planned was I was like oh I found a confetti not a confetti cannon and so the only thing that s like instead of checking in for our flights I was like waiting outside waiting outside my house to A A a fun pop off a confetti candidate Rylan that no one really got on camera very well Applause there s really nothing you can do and he s like no sir there s literally nothing I can do because you re the person everything that could have gone wrong went wrong yet we somehow still made everything we wanted to do it was just like stress level well as Michael Scott would say it was stress level midnight and midnight like these you know what I m saying and the crazy thing is me buying them day of I spent half of what you spent he spent on floor seats like we still got floor seats and I paid half because it was a day of but when you add up all the airfare from all the flights yeah it still wasn t so here s what I m saying like the the non planning was very expensive like we had to buy new outfits we had to buy toiletries that were then taken away from us again and we like still need to go buy toilet trees tonight which is gon na take hours out of our life we literally filed like a policeman missing and I was like shuttlefield traveler size set of fill face wash and lotion and a couple of travel toothbrushes that Rylan didn t even know that when you take a travel toothbrush apart you re supposed to put it back on itself and use it as a handle no I was using the handle that was just the head and I m like and then it comes out like he s just discovered this like life hack and that was hours later in the morning and it s like no that s the entire function of a travel toothbrush does any of this make sense could you follow anything we re saying I have Vlog footage I could like we re not going to so if you re listening to the audio version Dad I know that s only you um Saya this sounds crazy anyway I will probably never travel like this again but I do not think I will ever forget this trip like the memories are out of control yeah I I love that we went and bought swimsuits went to do we went to two different targets to buy swimsuits and they came back and the pool was closed and they re gon na charge us a hundred dollars each to use the A A the clothes I m telling you nothing really worked out but we made it to Taylor Swift we saw the entire show it was fantastic my favorite moments are still that of reputation I know like it s unpopular for me to think reputation s my favorite album of hers ever why is that unpopular I just don t think like that s most people s favorite album of hers but like everything from like the costumes to like what she was saying to the actual music itself and her performances of the songs it just it resonates oh I just loved every single moment of it so it was fantastic I really A A with because that s I A A with a few like they just take me back to my eras you know what I mean like my teen era my fresh to La era because red came out my first year in La when I met you and we we were Katy Perry s California girl was the first song I heard when I uh landed in Cal like I was you get to California and it does feel like a Dreamland because it is like all these roads that are like lined in palm trees and it was like California girls had just come out so I m like driving to the Grove which is like a very popular outdoor mall and like California Girls is blaring so it s like when I think of moving to La it s California girls for me that s what was out uh one year for Halloween I was California girls with cupcake tits we ve shown that asset but do you remember I had that costume in my center console of my car when I moved out here and there s a picture of I think you and me in my old Camry with the bra lit up with the cupcakes on it do you remember that picture no we can t access it either because I reported my old account and had it deleted what do you mean I couldn t remember the login to my old account and I didn t want I didn t know if there was anything on it that would be like bad so I just reported it until they deleted it you were an alcoholic at the time who knows what you I was out of control I feel like we should cut this part of the podcast so no one looks up any of that it s gone is it yeah yeah yeah it s gone it s gone that was a fun time that was a fun time it was a very fun time yep I loved those days heiress

tea now I do but I was confused by the hotness it s like hot has it been Hot it s spring it s not been hot it s been I m sweating we re sweating because we re scissoring right now between two beds on the floor but it s been cold okay it s cold right now it s degrees outside okay my face is wind chapped let s get into some iced tea though and I say iced tea because like is there anything that s really happening in this world except for me feeling like a failure no except for me also feeling like a failure are you really I had a bad failure week filling really yeah why I don t know I feel like I learned about yourself and acupuncture you took your best friend to go see Taylor Swift no I feel like going back to Colorado was really good for me and I do enjoy myself a lot in Colorado but I come back to California and I do feel this like pressure of like I should be able like while I m here especially if it s a limited amount of time and who knows how long we ll be in California or if we decide to be in California like I still have big dreams and I feel like it s hard for me to execute them and feel like I m not and it s crazy to say like I m not supported in them like I have had such a wonderful career on YouTube and I ve like accomplished so much and there s like even if you want to expand your if I stopped achieving today I could still be happy and like full of gratitude and enjoy my life but it is like I do feel this pressure of like oh I should be trying to execute especially because I I do feel this sense of like YouTube is I feel like the more expands the the more it feels like less and less people are on YouTube and you could also argue like maybe I don t I don t know because it s not even like a view thing necessarily but I do feel the sense of urgency like oh I need to expand into more of mainstream for my future to have a job that you love I I love this job too but it s like you hope and pray that like it will last and that it s sustainable you know like I feel like as Tick Tock gets bigger there s less and less popular YouTubers and it is scary because it s like well that s Evolution so like all things always grow and change you know for a long time people were into books and then they were into radio and then they were into TV but the problem is like I m not evolving with the um with my environment like I don t enjoy watching Tick Tock I don t enjoy making tick tocks so it s like I don t even like it doesn t interest me right so I don t want to create in that way and my Ultimate Dream and even not right now and I like have to trust like what s like I get bogged down and being like Oh I need to have like a team that s out there like fighting for me that s like pushing for me that s like like campaigning for these opportunities so I don t miss out if there s something out there but I think the problem like timing s everything yeah it s just like not meant to be and I do believe like when something s meant for you it will find its way to you like when that when that like lady was writing that sitcom that didn t come to fruition for us but it was like she found me because her daughter watched me and she was like I wrote this character and was thinking of you while I was writing this character I want you to come in for the role I have to like I m gon na send her a Christmas script by the way really yeah do you know her yeah that s why I was called in for the audition okay because she knows me but I just have to like trust that the Universe has a plan I think when I get to La it feels harder because it feels like everyone s achieving so much I really get what you re saying and I think that there s another thing about being in La specifically which is a lot of people are self promoters right and specifically like on Instagram where it s like Pub there their own publicist and I think people are really good at saying like look at me I m doing A A like look at me I m doing A A and the reality of the situation is like are you actually doing A A and I ve always known you to be a person who does A A I ve always known me to be a person who actually does A A right and I think that no matter what we have always been our own strongest Advocates and if sitting on the floor in the wind right now is not a testament to our will to A A survive while being as A A stupid as we are and as incapable as we are we ve gotten pretty A A far I granted I have dug my claws into your back and dragged my ass along behind you considerably but there are other rooms I ve gotten myself into like the point being like you just have to be persistent you have to not give up and you have to remember if you start tripping about the future you re not going to do the work in the president that you have to do to be where you want to be I think I get confused because it s uh sorry and this is like this is but it s a weird thing to bring to the podcast I feel like but he s been drinking I ve had a drink and I ve had two sips I feel like where I want to go isn t how I represent myself on the internet necessarily like it s true to me and I love vlogging I love podcasting but like my ultimate goal is to have a morning show a la Ryan and Kelly well I guess it s now going to be Kelly and her husband or it could be an island and Lizzie yes I mean that would be everything and I just think like if I m asking somebody to like help lead me in that direction or take a chance on me in that direction they look at my Vlog Channel and they re like oh like maybe this is intriguing but he s not the guy for the job like the guy for the job is the guy that s putting in the work doing the correspondent work over here even if it s and I think that s that s where I m like well where do I put my foot in what direction to get to where I want to go and I keep telling myself like well I have these problems like before I was in entertainment news before I was doing YouTube successfully and now I have maybe a different hurdle but it s a very luxurious hurdle like I still like I have a beautiful wonderful life but it s like how do I take a step in a different direction while also doing this like I never want to abandon YouTube but I do want to explore other Arenas but it s like how do I convey that to anyone else to be have them even campaign for me to get to that is it okay if I spitball on that yeah I wonder if it might be interesting if you tried self producing something that s more like that yeah like this is close well this isn t close well and that s sitting on like this isn t close no but like this podcast Shane s podcast it is a version of what I would like to do like it s it is a version of that but I think everyone has a podcast and it s like you know what I mean and I do sometimes feel like now it s like it s dark to say but it is like oh everyone the Market s so saturated with the entertainers and it s like everyone can create their own way with enough will and determination and persistence it s like is podcast the new like I didn t get to where I wanted to be so I m gon na podcast forever yeah those who can t do podcast Maybe I got ta go but this isn t for me I do do I love podcasting I genuinely do that s why we ve gone for over two years and it s like even if I got a different job we d still podcast no I was even just saying before we started rolling like I m so grateful that we are in a position to just A A off to Las Vegas for the weekend without having to lie to anybody about where we are like our employers like are at a real job right but I do think that I don t know like I I ve always it s I think the odds of us being able to to excel to a certain place means something do you know what I m saying like out of everybody in the world my dog Mr bubs went viral right do you know what I m saying yeah out of everyone in the world you Ryland are a viral person you know what I mean yeah I ve been able to make and here s the thing like I ve been able to make a career creating which is like the biggest blessing and that s what I have to keep coming back to is just like gratitude I think the part like that I m leaving out of this which is wait maybe why I m like getting in my head even more so is because I m feeling rejection from like people that I thought I like um I don t know like I ve reached out to people I ve worked with in the past and I m not like I m not kidding they re not wearing a door they re not or even responding yeah and it s like it just is like it s rejection yeah you know and this is what I was talking about the other week where I was like just A A say no to me just respond to me don t lead me on red like we have an existing relationship just A A respond to me yeah and like my previous like hosting agents merged with like the biggest agency in the world I did not expect them to like bring me along with them especially where like I wasn t focused on that to begin with like YouTube took off for me and I put all my eggs in that basket it s not like I was exploring and I was like well this is only going to help create to the next step and everyone wants what they don t have as well like the grass is always greener on the other side like yeah I m so like if I had an every Monday to Friday talk show right now we couldn t be in we couldn t do like let s go to Vegas tonight and go to Taylor Swift we d have to lie to our bosses and say I gave us both coven exactly and be on a no posting policy and so like that like the rejection had happened like earlier in the week and I was like dragging my feet about it a little bit and now I like Thursday Friday Saturday well Saturday we left but I was like just meditating a lot more journaling again and being like gratitude like gratitude what s meant for you will be you don t need to like fight for or like be you don t need to be something you aren t to get something you think you want when you re already where you need to be right you know I think that the something that I have to remind myself of constantly is I am exactly where I m supposed to be in this moment and every so often I will have moments of like Clarity and affirmation of that like creatively speaking like I ll put something into a screenplay that the team that s working on it would be like oh my God this is genius this is great like this is the soul that was necessary and to be completely honest I wouldn t have had that idea two years previous when I was like let s go go it s like well you re not ready to go and when you re ready to go it ll go and I keep telling myself that too and rejection is God s production all right and I agree and I think like things happen when they re supposed to happen like with who they re supposed to happen everything that I thought I wanted so bad that I didn t get I can now look back with Clarity and be like oh my gosh my life unfolded in such a better way and that s what I have to keep reminding myself in these moments where I feel like oh everyone else is getting all of these things and it s not that I m like I don t think anyone comparing despair though but that s what I m saying I don t I m not even that kind of person like I think everybody that gets anything no matter where they are like deserves like they put themselves in a position no matter where they are to get to what they got and it s like sometimes I don t buy it real like I know I m just eating because if you really do a deep dive into somebody Who You re like how did they get that job or like they got that job overnight like and this isn t even this is like the weirdest callback ever but like on TV this morning what is it what was it Parks and Rec or third yeah it was like Chris Chris and Lizzie s like he was literally in like every room she s like from the early audience looking back you see him in like small roles in every single movie playing opposite Ann Hathaway I was just gon na say Anne Frank playing opposite Anne Hathaway and you have no idea it s Chris Pratt I know Chris Pratt is Chris A A Pratt yeah yeah and it s it s just it s wild how life works and you just have to trust the process yeah like and I do trust the process but sometimes I can get bogged down I think because I put the pressure on myself in La I not to be the person that always brings it back to my program but we have a thing that we read in my program like a meditation like acceptance is the answer to all my problems today right and I and it s a really powerful tool for me and in addition to that uh because I used to feel really really bad right like I barely make a living doing what I love doing yeah and I have a lot of people in my circle who are very wealthy doing what we re doing and are very successful doing what we re doing and I feel like sometimes I work a little bit harder than those people but then I remember they probably worked this hard and that s how they got to where they are now so of course they can take a little bit of a break or it s just a different workload or it s a different workload but um but no matter what I remember that my actual purpose on this Earth is to be kind and loving to everybody that s it and when I remember with like with my whole heart and faith in the the universe or if you want to call it God or as I call her Ellen Ripley my purpose is to serve the ultimate love which is what I see God as I see God as ultimate love right so if I am fulfilling my purpose on this Earth I am acting with love and kindness to you and to everybody even people I can t A A stand which is why I m spiraling about that thing that I don t want to apologize for doing do you know what I m saying but you keep saying like I ll feel better when I apologize even though I don t think it s super warranted I mean for the behavior it s not like you really lashed out on somebody no but like but the bottom line is when I think about that and when I remember that s my A A purpose all of the other A A just sort of melts away and even yeah and like career is so small into like how you affect people on a large scale I think yeah but it is like because I m so like oh you ve got to start planting seeds for your tomorrow so there is this fine balance and I m like working hard and planning these seeds versus like trusting and knowing the seeds you plant are going to sprout Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow maybe not in the exact way you thought and that s another thing you do the work and you got it throughout the expectation yeah I m just here to do the work I can t control the results I m just here to do the work all right well let s move on from my I actually think that was really cool I think that was really cool like we re in Vegas you re a little wasted we re sitting on the floor this is like a full blown drunk girl talk except for one of us hasn t had alcohol for years um but yeah I think that was beautiful that was like a little that was a little ultimate advice though yeah yeah do you want to do some cold topics now now we can be nasty Laughter now let s A A on people that are successful no not that we re not I m just saying speaking of people who are successful that we re gon na A A on after saying my A A Credo is love and kindness next up on A A Rylan doesn t care about Katy Perry spent so much money to extra to get the California Girls music videos it s crazy that it s wrapped back to California Girls oh my God yeah and we re in Vegas where Katy Perry recently had a residency this is how slow the news was this week Katy Perry recently went on the record saying that she had to spend absurd amounts of money having her California Girls music video color retouched because she had a horrible spray tan and I would like to come on record as the palest A A you ve ever met with rosacea saying like when can we just love the skin we re in you know what I mean because I ve had a horrible A A spray tan incidences where I come out looking like I ve shoved my hand in something s ass and pulled it out and just have A A crusted in my Knuckles and all over the place and it s A A embarrassing and I don t feel good about it like I see you grow always on the internet A A putting full body makeup on to cover up your horrible spray tans like why can t you just be chill as you A A are like why do we have to lay in A A beds getting cancer everyone has I I agree with that the spray tan is like I it s not get it s not giving well it s not a tanning bed no so if you want to do it it s your prerogative I think it s the same as like you liking Botox it s like if that s something that somebody thinks makes them look more attractive go for it I just feel like your skin complexion is probably good you know like if that s what you look like it s the only reason why I hated my skin tone growing up is because people made fun of me and called me A A like Casper nips and A A you know called me pale because I grew up in a Beach town and everybody wanted to be tan and so I laid in tanning beds and I have skin cancer but everything like I it s hard and then on the other end of the spectrum you re too dark right you know what I mean people are bleaching their skin and I just think you know like I would like to advocate for like I both ends of the spectrum and everything in between like love yourself girl as Lady Gaga said as RuPaul says if you can t love yourself how the hell you re gon na love anybody else oh bro when I hated my everybody else because you have their own self love and I was like how could you be are there any more Hot Topics or should we do an advice question I mean there are more Hot Topics okay let me see if any of them no I m gon na do a lemonade no hold on hold on hold on well the biggest one that we could talk about is that Selena Gomez finally broke her silence on Justin Bieber and Haley Bieber I still okay I mean I I don t like I don t know what s going on with all of this but even her like asking for everyone to stop hating on Haley felt like a little Diggy to me and let me tell you why because she couldn t just say like Haley and I have been speaking and like hate in any form is not something I stand for but she had to take the position which I don t think was not not thought about saying Haley Bieber reached out to me and let me know she s been being like receiving death threats and this isn t something I stand for so it s not like we ve been talking about this and we both want to put him into this she wants to be like Haley had to reach out to like you know what I mean I feel you on that and I just feel like why did you have to go about it in that way because then it still like creates this subtle narrative that you re higher than in people to still give and listen like I don t know what either party has done that has like upset everyone and I know everyone s calling Haley Gone Girl and all of this stuff but it s just like I feel like it s all gross and I just don t like it I agree with you and I still think that this is an artificial result oh I m sorry I just burped and we re so close to each other it probably reeks hey you re the one who said nachos in a taco salad today bro so good after I was having tummy problems he s like let s get Nachos and Tacos so good my favorite restaurant is in the cosmo or no it s in Planet Hollywood and it s called Yolo s it s Mexican food oh it s all right it s all right you re tripping if you think that s worth driving four A A hours to pick up the nachos no but if you re in Vegas that s where you need to go you told me you and Shane fantasize about coming back just for the nachos well for a Vegas trip but like our first stop is the nachos okay all right I love nachos that have melted cheese but also layered queso and you can get that baby not the do it the way I like it anyway I think that and we ve said here on the podcast before like everything that sort of transgressed has been the result of fan speculation and it is not actually founded in factual reality I don t think Haley intentionally shaded Selena I do feel like a little bit like Selena has not done a great job of DSi I think a lot of this started from Selena commenting on people speculating well the speculation came first and then the comment on the speculation followed I think she was commenting I mean I I mean I I m not it doesn t matter it doesn t matter but the bottom line is I still think a bunch of this has come from an artificial situation that was created by speculation right and it s silly end of the day and and they re all super rich Super Famous and no matter what anyone thinks of them they re gon na be fine they are gon na be fine and also like I don t think Selena s fandom realizes that they re writing so hard that they re doing her dirty because they ve now called her fat by they literally alleged that Haley called her fat when she didn t so when a fan says that you re it s like they re saying she is fat do you see what I m saying now which let me stick up for Selena in this regard then you re thinking oh my gosh they think I m fat and then you might believe like oh maybe Haley s fans did implant to my fans and then she s getting upset not because of something Haley said yeah because something that s implied and then she s upset and not even because of Haley but then starts commenting on her random things and that s what I m trying to say right and then now her fans have done her so dirty that she has to communicate with her ex fucking boyfriend her biggest heartbreak of all s wife and then advocate for her on the internet like Selena fans stop doing this to her and when you put it like that just knock it off maybe if I was Selena I d be like Haley reached out to me too because she s probably like that I don t want to ride for this thing my husband right and now I have to stick up for her wife his wife on the internet and also Selena foreign I don t think Justin Bieber is surprised to be one do you know what I m saying I love Justin Bieber oh I love him too but I feel like us pretending like the biggest wound of Selena s life is Justin Bieber married I mean you don t know the trajectory of their relationship how it ended exactly the Ebbs and flows of it well so like it was probably a defining chapter in Selena s life and it and like and I m not saying it s not but I m not saying but I m also saying she wasn t meant to end up with Justin Bieber and that s okay you re correct yeah but it doesn t mean it doesn t hurt to look at online when they re both hugely popular and she sees them on Instagram even when she s not looking yeah and so stop A A super gluing her to it like let her move on guys let her move on because the victory here isn t her marrying Justin Bieber it s her getting to move the A A on yeah I agree sir aren t you glad we did that one yeah we solved a case today this Gwyneth Paltrow thing is like pretty intriguing to me too is it really yeah my mom was like saying like oh I ve been watching the Gwyneth Paltrow trial and then I was like I know nothing about it and then I started doing a deep dive into it and like I haven t watched hours I watched every video Inside Edition put out about it okay which is like four and I just so like the guy saying so she was in a skiing accident the guy says she hit him and he suffered damage to his brain that has caused his life to spiral downward she claims he was skiing behind her hit her right and now is suing her and she s like no that s not how it happened he was suing her for like Millions now took it down to just to like recoup medical costs and stuff she s counter suing for a dollar and in my opinion I don t think she would her time is so valuable valuable because she runs a very successful company I don t think she would take the time out of her day to counter sue for a dollar because she s so rich I do think she could hand over the three hundred thousand dollars if he was going to tell the principal he s the the what he is doing is essentially extortion right you are a rich and famous which makes you vulnerable to the public eye and if you care so much about how you re perceived then give me three hundred thousand dollars and I ll shut the A A up and that s why to me I think she s probably telling the truth because why would she take so much time off work to counter sue for a dollar if she was lying at all she should just pay the three hundred thousand dollars yeah because she can and she s really wealthy yeah um and that s what I think is so I think it s important like as much as I m like not down with this A A because a lot of the stuff that Gwyneth Paltrow does I think is fairly harmful I think people hate her because she s authentically herself and not apologetic for her wealth her how she lives I don t give a A A about her wealth but it does bother me that she sells a lifestyle that is inherently like but to me anything could be like you could say Kim Kardashian is the same way and in my mind if you don t like that if you don t subscribe to it you don t turn on the the channel and you don t tell your kids to watch it either like right your kids shouldn t be watching the Kardashians and thinking that they re how they their bodies should look like you should be in control of saying don t watch that to your children yeah and if it does damage to your brain you turn it off as well I agree before we transgress too far I would like to laud her for this because I think on principle being a woman who stands up for yourself in this scenario and advocates for yourself even though it s taking time and money away from what you need to be doing to keep being a strong powerful A A you re sending a message that it is okay for me to do these things and it is very Taylor Swift of her not only in the symbolism of the one dollar but it s like the fact that she s actually taking the A A time to do this when it s publicly humiliating for her too there s video cameras in the courtroom yeah and it s inspiring for when other women to see stand the A A up for yourself you deserve it but I know she does put out crazy into the world but yeah I m divorcing this from the part of her character that I m not down with and in the A A trial did you see that recently the opposing lawyer was like you re friends with Taylor Swift right did you see that yeah and she s like is this just like a bunch of girls getting together to like do this thing and it s like how the A A could a woman do that how could a woman stand in a court of law and then like say that stuff also this guy sent an email to his daughter being like I m famous now because I had to run in with Gwyneth Paltrow and it s like you re a creep dude and it s opportunistic I just I don t think she s lying as much as the world might just have a distaste in their mouth for Gwyneth Paltrow because she s got a lot of privilege and spreads a lot of things that could be like annoying at best I kind of live for her you would I would I m just and I love Kourtney Kardashian so here we are there s a couple of problematic Queens on the floor at the win you know what I hope you guys

always there wherever I am A A my own A A up and it s enough is enough I m done can you explain the scooter you trolled in with today controlled in okay so you know when I come to Burbank I park at the stage and I walk so if I I thought I ll get a scooter so I got a scooter hot pink by the way it s all they had sure this was the only choice I had anyways I scoot in there scooting s hard in your s let me just tell you guys it s not what it is A A classic Razor scooter pink Razor scooter it s everything uh I will not be doing it again well yeah did you not think about going through security problem it s very light none of that s the problem no that s the problem it s very light Riley if you re gon na join this podcast you need to do it civilized come on Riley s looking like she wants to A A some A A up get up here Riley don t move the camera don t move the camera right now sir you need to very safely finish your way don t put the holder by the ears bro hey don t act like I m doing something wrong come on poor thing that s it she s just trying to live her life oh Riley anyways the burden of the scooter is in the writing of it as a person who s full grown those are not made for full size adults did you know that um I had to create I had to like hunch over it to reach the handlebars and then I had to keep my left leg in a constant squat position to get low enough and then before you know it your legs burn and like I work out but my leg was like burning I had to keep getting off and walking it hurt it hurt it burnt so I m more concerned about the faces you got at the airport like how were people observing you I got no faces at the airport there s no way that you got no face okay I was like tell me you rode this down the hall and I was like I didn t write it down the hall because I m not an A A I mean if you have it utilize it why would I write it in an in a busy Airport I I myself Lizzy a klutzy mcgoverns which is a word that people call it s a name eclipsy mcgoverns oh you ve heard it we ve all heard it we ve all heard Collective mcgoverns out of all the unaware like self unaware gosh I can t even think out of all of the things I brought it from home I just can t believe that s your line like riding the scooter that you rode to the airport in the airport Bonkers it was like it was like retirement community vacation day it would be nice they re all end of summer so is Labor Day the end of summer yes I know but like is it actually I mean not for us does it just sick does it we choose when our summer ends here I want to know is it I don t know I m wearing white you can t wear white after Labor Day okay those are fake rules they re not fake rules they re fake rules loser I want to know when does fall actually start I think or is Labor Day just made up to close the pools down when it s still degrees I mean they ve already released the pumpkin spice latte so it might be fall I feel like Starbucks has to get an early cash in anyways that s not the point Lizzy gets here and she goes what s going on it s disgusting here it is and I said what are you my Tick Tock for you page Laughter did they say that about you like people are commenting on your A A that you re disgusting is that what you mean no so I m dabbling on Tick Tock again I m trying to consume to become a tick tock star I don t even I m I m on the fence if if I even want to become a tick tock star the intensity of your tick tocks is like palpable it s like an intenseness that I have never seen I left no crumbs wow he s speaking to talk now too that s what I ve learned you eat it that s what I ve learned I ate No Cry I ate and I left no crumbs is what people I ve learned this week that s what Tick Tock has taught me and it further please remember when he used to just A A A A on me all day I think you ve let me finish I haven t come to conclusions coming uh no I still A A hate Tick Tock even if I m the biggest tick tock well if I m the biggest tick tocker on the platform maybe I ll come around but I don t think I ever will be right so my tick I just find it very interesting and I don t find Tick Tock enjoyable to watch and I am angry that it s taken over a lot of other like it s become so mainstream that it s annoying to me yeah and I was like let me try let me try my best to put myself inside and understand why people love making Tick Tock why people love consuming Tick Tock and I guess maybe my for you page just isn t cultivated for me yet yeah because I hate it right and half of the tick tocks that are served on my for you page are people talking about the reasons they hate Colorado and I m like why are you serving like what why why would I because I live in Denver you think this is what I want and it s a lot of people like yeah there s like seven different people making like why did I hate about Denver Colorado I couldn t even get through them because there s nothing because my Tick Tock for you page has a lot of like you have to eat at this place in Denver Colorado oh yeah I wonder why mine s hateful and yours is do you hate it here no I like Colorado I m liking it more more every day honestly I m coming at I m yeah I really like it here right now right now in this moment I love it here once it starts getting cold debatable debatable maybe I ll start loving it I don t I don t ever think I ll be I m excited for it to get cold out here yeah you missed the snow last year I missed the snow last year but I won t miss it this year because we will be making a Christmas movie yes we will we re manifesting what s going on I finished the first draft okay and I bought the dog s snow suits okay so it s happening I started the rewrite today yesterday and I ll be working on it and delivering that tomorrow night okay and then I ll probably send it to you okay yeah I m excited to read it it s very funny I ve only had like small bits and pieces I ve read it out loud with a couple of people and I have to tell you I tickle myself to the you ve heard the whole thing out loud like a vomit like this is my process okay I have a process I like to read my outlines out with Sarah out loud with Sarah stretton and then I like to read a draft out loud with my friend Anna who gives really good notes so it s very sloppy it s like a vomit pack so we re gon na be on like V you ll be on V okay wow I don t know how much like great input I will be personally well I think really this is the kind of script that comes to life in the room because I ve tried to like capture our ridiculous banter and uh so I think more than anything it s going to be about like on the day just like irritating you a little bit okay but how do we get that across to whoever we re selling it to they know they know yeah they know they ve seen the podcast we have like a specific eye yeah it s Adam okay hey Adam hey Adam hopefully he s not watching this it s embarrassing because I m happy to see the A A out of something that he hasn t totally agreed with yet but I m acting as if he has okay I mean yeah that s the way forward for sure absolutely okay well hopefully we re filming that this January January and um so on back to my Tick Tock oh right we re still there I m sorry I thought it felt over to me so I well I have to tell you a little bit about my process I was trying to understand like what was so enjoyable about it but I can t find anything quite honestly and so maybe that s why I m not a good tick talker because the tick tocks that I enjoyed uh making flopped so hard I wanted to die uh they did good on Instagram reels though like the ones that flopped on Tick Tock did good on Instagram which ones are you talking about so like my first one where I did like a Target Vlog oh yeah see yeah I mean I thought it was fun if it was inside of a vlog it would have been great yeah but people have zero attention span another reason Tick Tock is like ruining the world because our intent are I mean I already don t have an attention span and now on a tick tock if it goes longer than seconds with no punch I m irritated so I flopped really hard and then I thought wow what is this because there s people that can do seemingly I know a lot of people spend a lot of time on a lot of tick tocks that do go viral but there s a lot also a lot of tick tocks that are seemingly nothing that get million views and it s hard to Rack my mind around it right so yeah and so I I m rolling with the punches today he s a changed man a Tick Tock man and so I just I don t know I had like a mini breakdown because I looked and I was like wow so you had a mini breakdown so I started shut up because my Riley one the one of Riley chasing the host got views in the first hours which means hell yeah no that s I don t know man it s so bad th I don t know man if I have I have like almost like nearly if you round up a million followers yes I don t and nearly followers right now not that I know exactly numbers numbers and so that means that Tick Tock doesn t even push it to the people that are following me yeah so it s all for you page based yeah that s what I m saying like I don t understand oh I don t either and so I can barely you started doing all those numbers and I just glazed okay followers on Tick Tock my Tick Tock got views numbers oh my gosh yeah it flopped flop flop flopped yes so I just didn t understand so then I started filming a video like oh I m gon na try to like go viral again on tick tock I get a viral Tick Tock in my opinion like million views like she s so famous who is she so famous and so I m documenting the process and I go to organize the footage yesterday YouTuber s worst nightmare the whole intro where I m having like the most insane breakdown about being a flop on Tick Tock is gone that can t be recreated the whole video is A A ruined Jesus I m so mad I spent three hours trying to find the footage and then I realized I may be deleted and recorded over it while I when my memory card ran out of space damn what a nightmare that is honestly it is your meltdowns are the best and I like Shane was I was like having such a meltdown and Shane you should have filmed so much fun that s what I filmed and it s gone it doesn t exist no but you could film this meltdown now the lost the lost footage meltdown and then I filmed the whole journey but now I feel like without that intro the whole video is a flop now I feel like my week was a flop because I don t even like Tick Tock you better let that go you could do just to sit down talk to camera listen guys she s flopping and then here s what you do you just lay on the floor and flop like a fish you didn t want to experience it listen to my solution because it s great you want to go viral girl I don t know if I do I m trying to figure out the point of tick tock because let me tell you I dove into the analytics of my million views guess how much I made for million views on Tick Tock three dollars oh that is why are people tick tocking I don t know because they love it but I do think race here s what I think we should do coming from the guy who s told me not to do Cameo because it ll seem like a cash crab I know I m no I m not a cash grab type of person unless it comes to tick tock in which case he s like where s the bags at no but I was curious to see like what a video that like I think if you re a million views is substantial yeah thirty four dollars is nothing no for a lot yes yeah so I just think like the only people making money on Tick Tock have to be the Addison rays that are pumping out million views consistently which I know it s not all about money but it s just fascinating so it s times we re back to math I m going to count it I tried doing that and I gave up where do you work at a place where accountants work Tick Tock we re doing it right now I do want to do a thing where I film you flopping on the floor in a bunch of different locations and we just cut it so it will do it don t worry okay it ll be great here s what I ve decided oh my God if inspiration hits and it s fun then I ll do the Tick Tock but I don t think I want to fully immerse myself inside of tick tock it has nothing to do with money honestly it s just like I try is like way too much and that s like that s like a low key they re great some of them are great but if it s like knowing how hard you try on it that makes me be like oh was that six hours did six hours go into this did six hours go into those which one the dancing London no no the Riley one was on my camera roll right it happened in seconds yeah the one the one the Meghan marker I m a Diva one yeah yeah that was pretty great yeah I don t care if it flops or does great well Shane made the sound because did you he and I don t like you have to know the origin like you know Meghan Markle has a podcast who s Meghan Markle oh please and Mariah Carey was on her podcast and Mariah Carey called her a diva Mariah Carey called Megan Merkel a diva yeah Megan was denying it and then she does like a wrap up after Mariah s gone and she s like everything was going seemingly well until she called me a diva and she s like it stopped me in my tracks and it s like what Megan like what what the A A also we need to reclaim the word Diva a diva is just a top of the A A line operatic singer we got ta stop with this negative connotation on the word Diva that s a woman who s at the top of her A A game and that s chill okay so eat my diva ass well follow me on tick tocks still think I hate it do you think it s like uh I ve seen some reels that are from Tick Tock that say tick tock s gon na take over all of media yeah no way I think all social media dies at some point I ve already heard about new things that I can t remember the name of that I just I can t in fact everyone at one point was saying YouTube s the future yeah and then streaming came along and streaming is what kind of took down everything out so it was like a different iteration everything dies everything has a life cycle and everything dies it s a constant ebb and flow and quite frankly like I don t love social media like I do enjoy vlogging but I don t really like interacting on YouTube on Instagram or Tick Tock well and that s I think my problem I think as a consumer I love consuming YouTube I love getting my lunch sitting down watching somebody Vlog I can t imagine like sitting down and scrolling while I m eating food yeah I know people do it yeah and maybe my theory was that initially maybe like parents have the television set so it s easier for a kid to just scroll on Tick Tock but I think it s all ages that are watching Tick Tock yeah I think it s all ages I also like feel like you know that movie ready that yeah Ready Player One probably not everybody it s in in that Society everybody lives in a virtual reality okay everything s a virtual exchange all your friends are online you wear a headset you re in you know but A A nowhere just living this fake life online and I don t like that I like being in person I like being outside even though it s degrees like I like I like personal exchanges that are real you know what I mean like I d rather meet up with the homies than like meet up with the homies so that we can take pictures and post them on Instagram like I don t like that yeah so I specifically don t like Tick Tock which even though Tick Tock is a little bit different from that it s kind of not well you re I mean the number one consumer in my life yeah Tick Tock yeah so you re guilty well you watch me do it to zone out right that s literally you my whole body shuts down and that s your Preferred Choice over Television over YouTube it s like when the Kardashians aren t airing or if I ve already seen the Kardashians episode and I need to meditate and leave my body for a minute you know what I mean okay it s a disassociative state that I enter right it s great for pooping okay well let s move on to your life why why not because I need a break from it seem interested in my stories I was it s just you know with Tick Tock is like you come back and you re like I m dating that guy again I think I still hate it I think it s yeah and that s usually what happens with the guys too okay okay it s the same cycle do I have lipstick on my teeth no oh you re just staring at them and I feel like you re about to hit me with them aggressive lipstick crazy I don t like that all right you were bullied at the nail salon I was bullied at the nail salon tell me about it well I went to a nail salon that I usually go to but I had a technician that I usually don t it s my friend s wedding on Friday this Friday Saturday yeah whoa I m going to Washington on Friday whoa yeah I have to take a A A plane and then I have to take a shuttle and then I have to take a boat and then I have to take another shuttle sounds like a nightmare it s a lot it s gon na be a lot but I think it s gon na be really fun I ve never been camping and this feels like camping adjacent it s a camping wedding no but it feels camping adjacent like I m staying in a historical house okay I think it s camping adjacent there ll be s mores all right whatever it s gon na be fun as A A I think I ve never been I m going to an island in Washington like what the A A anyways what was I talking about oh so we go to get our nails done at this place and like quite frankly there s a reason why I go to San Diego to get my nails done it s better A A service better prices better prices I have a relationship with the nail technician like I care about her she cares about me anyways does she care about you she does okay she does I m just curious and jobs how much is going along to getting along oh I was invited to her baby gender reveal whoa yeah we re friends anyways at this other place at this godforsaken place that she ll go unnamed because I m going to continue to have to go as long as I can t I don t have the time to go to San Diego um they charge you up the ass and they are they hate you and I m so confused why they hate me like I tip really well because I feel like you know we re here you re doing we re spending a lot of time with me this Salon takes a cut of what I m paying I feel like they re in La they re probably used to the girlies putting in their air pods and just zoning out yeah and that s fine because like I ll do the same but it s like why do you have to hate me what do you mean like Define well first I ll be like oh can I have it shorter they go no if you want it shorter I can t do this design and it s like I m showing them a design of a nail it s very short it s confusing you know what I mean it s like gaslighting and confusing and I go okay uh well did you show them the inspiration prior to sitting down yes and I mean because I understand like if it s art and you re working with a smaller surface area it s harder to accomplish the art but it s not a smaller surface area and is this the art this is not this is not what I asked for at all this is the Haley bigger glazed donut and it is not what I asked for but it is what I had to leave with after I because it s like I want to be an advocate for people who get their nails done to be like don t accept anything less than what you ask for but it s also like you have to gauge the capability of the artist that s doing it and sometimes it s not there so I go in with a very simple design I wanted the glitter star that s just you know it s two lines intersecting basically it s like a cross and then I wanted a gem in the middle so first she starts gaslighting me saying we don t have colored gems and then she pulls out A A colored gems and I m like all right it s confusing whatever and then she goes all right um and I know they have all of the Gold Dust because I ve had the gold dust from them before right and they have samples of it like I m seeing a A A sitting next to me getting the Gold Dust I go and she pulls out just a regular gold glitter thing to do this I ll show you the design because it s cute and it s simple well no just send it to me later okay are you sure because you we don t want to do acids today we re turning this around should we pull it up basically it s a simple design she s like I can t do the gold I can t do the gold powder over it and I go you can t and she s like no I can t I do this I m gon na do this instead and I m just like I don t want that I don t want to pay for that yeah A A I m spending A A dollars on these nails I don t want what the A A you re pressing on me instead see and she puts it she goes I show you she shows me and I go yeah I don t want that and then she s like well then I ll take it off I was like girl I told you I didn t want it before you put it on but I m just sitting there A A terrified because I also know if I leave right now I have a half set of sticky A A Nails on what am I gon na do with that I can t even put my hair up it s hot so I m just sitting there nicely like oh yeah no I still don t A A want that you crazy A A and she s also looks crazy behind the eyes like there s craziness back there she has these nuts over filled lips that are like basically bruised from so much filler that don t move and she has these gnarly fake like teeth in her mouth that are like the veneers that are bad and she s like you don t want that and I was like no I do A A want that that s why I keep A A asking for it and then she goes no and I m just like all right I ll just go A A myself do whatever you can do just to make this over you know what I mean I didn t say any of that I m being very polite the whole time I m like okay yeah so like no and then she goes you want me to put Gold Dust all over and I was like not really see but this is a Learning lesson to never let it happen again well usually communicate up front I did communicate up front I was being a normal person the entire time I m not mad you don t understand the situation you re held at gunpoint by these women when they have their hand in their A A hands it s nuts I m not the only one who feels this way either women across the country are A A terrified to tell their nail technician I understand they hate their nails I have a Karen story about furniture delivery so I get it it s similar sorry at this in the same day my friend A A Cynthia texted me a horrible picture of her nails she goes Lizzy I got in the car and I started crying and my husband said I needed to go back in there and tell them to fix it and I was like I would never she s like I did because he told me to and I was like well good for you because your A A was more A A up than mine but it was gnarly it was gnarly and this is because I usually go to this woman there who s great she s like a like a A A D printer for nails like you show her something and she makes it happen but I booked the bride s nail appointment with her so that she could have the good girl because it s her wedding day and I m a selfless caring individual anyway did you go up to that woman and say look what happens how A A this is we get in there and they go you guys can t sit together if you want to see like the girl that I signed her up with and Shannon goes oh well then I ll just sit in here and I looked at you and I m like you don t know what you re doing right now like go see The Other Woman Do not sit here with me but she wound up getting a good guy who did like an airbrush or whatever which was fine so then at that point you should have pivoted and gone to your lady I thought about it but I was already like be this woman like held my hand like this literally like this and honestly hurt me multiple times I was like ow dude what the A A she s like oh so what s up and she goes oh this can happen I will not be seeing her I will only be seeing the one woman I always see A A your weddings A A I m not booking you with my chick if I m going with you to get your nails done we re done so go to somebody that has been recommended or that you like but I don t know like there s I ve had similar situations with haircuts where I feel like I m locked in a chair at the mercy of the person that s doing the work and I already tried to explain what I want but it s going wrong but how do we better navigate those scenarios I m always look I m like be kind show them a A A picture clearly articulate what it is you simple terms I do that every A A time this woman crazy crazy and these were the lips crazy it was nuts dude it was nuts she was so mad literally kept yanking yanking you know and I kept being like I was like I ll do whatever you tell me lady like please be nice to me it was nuts and then the girl who runs the place had to keep coming over and talking to her she s like am I in trouble and it s like or if you have to ask in front of me while you re abusing me and your boss comes over to ask you to please chill the A A out if you re in trouble you re probably why don t you flag down the boss and say could you finish this job honestly I m at the brink of like outing the salon because it s so A A it s wild bro like I ll wait there for three hours for an appointment that I made two days prior you know what I mean oh it must be in Studio City it definitely is all right well uh I don t know should we get into you fainting on uh first date or well that s connected to how embarrassed I

out to people saying please A A help me I could cry right now I m like help me help me they re like what s up like why don t you ask you this like I ve asked those people for help and they ve told me to go A A myself so I one woman sets me up with this other woman and I you as you know if you ve listened to the podcast I have Vasa vesos I don t know how to say it oh the fainting thing the fainting thing right and it happens like every four years and I had a really strong coffee that morning that was so strong that like the second I had it I was like this is why you re in green tea now yes wait this is why you re traveling with your matcha yeah I m half coffee because I can t keep doing this to myself so I m like I feel like I ve done like methamphetamine I m on my way to meet this A A it s A A in the morning I m in Toluca Lake trying to act like I m a cool person I m also trying to go off gluten because I m tired of farting in public so I m in like I sit down to talk to this woman and out of the blue I m like oh I m gon na A A faint right now I don t know her I don t know this woman the only thing I ve said at this meeting too is how how hard I ve been stalking her on the internet I m talking I m literally like yeah I know everything about you from your son s birthday to your husband s job to how you got into this industry I ve seen all your short films I m a big A A fan of yours I don t want coffee who got you this meeting another woman I barely know she s like oh this other woman she s so like how do you know Jody and I was like oh I don t she s a stranger too you re sitting across from a super caffeinated stranger who then literally when I start to faint all the blood leaves my face and I turn gray and I m not exaggerating I turn A A gray I hate to do this to you but we ve run out of space just gon na A A myself I m going back to Burbank enough is enough I m done one take two okay I don t want to interrupt your story but I do want to say a lot of people are like if you re always running out of space why don t you just get a bigger memory card I have had A A ups in the past where I just run out of memory but we do also have to stop every minutes because the camera only allows a minute record time just wanted to clear the air he s not a monster are you guys he s just dealing with what the lord gave him anyways she turns gray I turn gray my pupils A A dilate so I really look like I m on meth and I m just sitting there like A A A A A A I can t tell this woman I m gon na faint so so I just uncrossed my legs and like my Botox lady was like if you just press your legs into the ground sometimes you can stop it from happening so I m just sitting there pressing my legs into the ground sitting across from this woman I m gray in the face like this and I look quiet and then I just start putting my hair up just trying to get air on my neck I m just sitting there like this like actively listening it s like and then I was like wait this is because my blood pressure drops maybe I need to put something in my body to make my blood pressure so then I can start shoving muffins in my mouth like I ve never eaten a muffin in my entire A A life and it s like all bad and then I m like wait maybe I m out of the woods I took a deep breath I go not happening today not today not today not in front of Katie so I don t faint and I m like okay I can talk again I can talk to her again I start talking instantly oh my God I See Stars tunnel vision closes in sound dissipates I m like why why I put my hair back down and put it back up like I m just pressing down again why don t you communicate to her because I don t know her and it s psychotics right here I have decided if I was any closer to painting I was gon na tell her I was pregnant because everybody has sympathy for a pregnant A A I was panicking and then I was like but if I tell her I m pregnant I m gon na have to tell her I miscarried If this relationship persists but no matter what like it wasn t the time to tell a stranger I have a fainting syndrome I m like I want to direct I want to command a crew and a cast and I m just sitting there like you know what I mean like just trying to be okay so she never responded to my follow up email and also sent her that cover letter that says I have subscribers that I think want to see a Christmas movie so bad I m gon na make it she probably called the lady that set up the meeting you Jody what the hell that A A is on drugs so now not only have you ruined your relationship with Katie you ve ruined your relationship with Jody who set up the meeting and they all think you re Bonkers it s weird that no one wants to represent me but you guys it s because I m A A desperate you should see me on my element though I shine I A A shine and then I had a meeting with one of my DPS that I love he does a lot of like high end commercials he works with a lot of production companies who are constantly asking for female directors and so he said let s shoot a spec commercial and then I can show them your work to them that I shot right and we can both benefit from that and I was like oh great love that at that meeting now I m triggered by breakfasts I got so nervous sitting down at that breakfast I was like A A I m gon na pass out but I know that guy so well that I was like Matt I m gon na faint see isn t this the problem like we can be great yeah like we are great and that s the thing but trying to sell yourself to somebody who doesn t already know your greatness yeah it s nearly impossible and it s just so exhausting I ve prayed multiple times I m like why can t there just be like a manager that has seen me yeah and appreciates me and wants to go to bat for me I don t even need to to go to bat for me I just need you to set up a plate for me to stand over and bat at do you know what I m saying like I vote because like obviously my dream has always been to get into hosting on a larger scale like I I don t know if I ll I ll always Vlog here and there because I I love it so much but like eventually I want to have an hour long Morning Show like yeah hello Ryan and Kelly yeah why not please why not you know I need a job what did I just tell you I m pregnant but the problem is like I ll go on IMDb and I ll search for hours all of these people s managers but it s like how am I ever going to a get their attention and then B make them a fan enough to want to because really I don t think like an agent s different and agent s just trying to get you cash for booking jobs but a manager wants to like break down doors for you to make jobs happen for you or sell jobs with you and like you can t do that unless the person fully is also in line or appreciates your work and then that s to you with writing as well yeah here s the deal potential managers all you want to do is make money for you I want to make you A A money dude there s nothing else I can do in this life I am unfucking employable in any other field I am hyper creative and a low key nightmare but I can keep it together for hours on a set please God help me I m crying well I guess I should tell you about my embarrass no I it wasn t an embarrassment you didn t A A your pants it s not worth sharing I didn t A A the first time I fainted I told everyone that this kid A A his pants so that they would be more concerned about him shooting his pants than me fainting so you did make it like you oh I made it I pulled through oh at the end of the meeting she like stood up and was like ready for a hug and I knew if I stood up I was gon na faint so I just looked at her and said have a good day I said you could have you have a good day now who paid for this lunch it wasn t even a lunch it was a coffee I tried to buy her coffee too because that s like part of it I m like you guys I m Rich As A A let me buy you a coffee and pick your brain mm hmm well here s the hoping for a better Q the fact that we re already in Q makes me sicker if it s right or phone no who knows we re definitely in Q right no Q we re in Q here s I think it s three months I don t know what it went out okay we could be in Q hahaha should we ask Austin him he had copied I know what a loser literally so many did you wash your hands after the airport because I did I m not A A okay because a lot of people there s like four people in my life that have covered not that I ve come in contact with but like name names and like give me addresses okay so I was mortified the other day because I think I m a very clean person like I shower a lot yeah I I just think like my hygienics are good yeah and especially when I m going to morning workout classes I know that sometimes they re packed all the way full and you might be as close as we are to somebody else sweating your ass off and so I m always like really conscious of deodorant I even like make sure my hair is decent half the time and I m in this yoga class and a I don t know if boys just sweat more than girls because like or I also like work really hard in workout classes yeah you can attest to this we go to Orange Theory I do give my all like I go you burn the amount of calories a person consumes in a day which then also is the downfall because I can t consume enough calories so that I m in a calorie deficit and then I have a headache because of it but that s Orange Theory yoga is a little bit different and my problem is with this yoga class because I was in this packed class it was tight and Tiny and by the end of the class this woman next to me was covering her nostrils and putting the towel up her nose acting as if I stunk are you sure that was about you who else would it be about did it smell in the room yes was it you no I did an armpit check in the room when I glanced over and saw her putting her towel up her nose and I was like I m so offended because I am sorry are you sure she thought it was you who else the person who probably actually stunk in the room it feels personal when they re as close to you as they are to me well it was there was she was it just is it like I mean there s somebody on your other side as well yeah so she could have been upset about that guy you might be reading into that I don t know it felt very targeted and then I also I think I m internalizing it more because I sweat like a crazy A A like the girls next to me they re like lightly damp yeah and I m like dripping water and I m gross to be next to because of that yeah but I think it s because I go so hard and like if there s a posture I m going all the way in the posture I m telling it as hard as I can hold on if you can whatever all the way I really felt like she thought I smelled and I can t let go of it I m sorry that happened to you thank you I just still feel like it s not that bad gin Jesus what s up on my latest Vlog where I m designing the barn everyone is saying this should be your star s h a m star job what Oh I thought you would I thought it was like Tick

Tick Tock are doing like millions of views someone s like we need to go to a drive through right now so that I get recognized to feel better about myself um which I love for you that isn t something I would never say on camera no I m just kidding I like don t like to go out I m joking I m joking I m hoaxing you okay I m blacked out now okay these are all um produced by Lizzy did you read any of them yeah I clicked on the links some of them I care more than others dude speaking of sweating I m so freaking hot right now and I m dripping take it off I can t I m not wearing a shirt there s not a bra no I mean also like look at this I m not trying to put that on camera you know what I m saying okay so it s a bloat thing so Leonardo DiCaprio dumped another girl after she turned so is this a recurring theme yeah this is a recurring so is no but like I know is cut off people are making graphs and A A of course she doesn t have one pulled up I know I m so sorry I was up at driving to get here scooter into here scooter into the airport so how many girlfriends has he had that were dumped at the brisk age of I think it s like all of them okay here s the graph you re kidding me look oh my God one two three four women have made it how many girlfriends has he had A A ten that dude oh this shows the brackets of when they started wow so he does long term real relationships with these but he cuts it off at can t get too close you know what I m saying and well so what are your thoughts um I was just wondering if you had any favorite meme from it I haven t I didn t even know this was happening oh you said there were favorite memes but I there was not a link to any memes oh I just assumed you d seen them where because they re just all over they re fine all over well mostly Instagram oh yeah are you liking rails yet no I I will say I also dabbled here s my problem with shorts tick tocks reels I feel like everything I know doesn t apply because I posted a short on YouTube and they didn t put it out to the subscribers over in hours it got less interaction less views than I get interaction like on a community post so I just I can t fathom the world crazy she doesn t care you took five hours to pull it up I was trying to tell a story while you were pulling it up so that it wasn t Dead Silence oh I was trying to listen to you no um nothing nothing okay so great I just that graph killed me another one bites the dust Another One Bites the Dust and who was it this time who even knows you know what I mean this is great for her though she s all over the daily mail if she s trying to push something Now s the Time okay and uh you know foreign so this is in continuation of the funny girl drama that you don t give a rat s ass about okay Leah Michelle did an interview with people about taking over beanie feldstein s role as the funny girl and funny girl okay and is the funny girl it s not Barbra Streisand originally had the role well Barbra Streisand s had it before after another A A had it but I don t know any of these people okay I read the article so I tried to get up and up on the tee but the funny thing is is the amount of times that Liam Michelle claims that she wrote a letter to beanie feldstein considering everybody in the world believes that Lea Michele is illiterate what what how did you not know that people think that Leah Michelle is literate I did not know that oh yeah there s an ongoing joke that Leah Michelle doesn t know how to read if I can sing and act like Leah Michelle I d let all of you joke about how I can t read or write who cares right well it felt like she cares because then they re out of time she was like I wrote I saw the play and then I wrote I personally picked up a pen and wrote letters on a page that equal into words and was this damage control because how did the shift of roll go like who was fired and who was replaced uh it was a big it was a big flop for Beanie it was a big speaking of flops beanie flopped beanies flop went viral on Tick Tock no it was more like it was like people with the news articles it s a beanie Francine got weird and if you can see from this article here on their grades this is why I hate it but it was deeper than that so everybody like Leah Michelle was the girl for funny girl she s always talked about wanting this so why would they give it to somebody else to begin with well that s that s where the drama originates they gave it to beanie feldstein and then Logan s sister no different guy that also looks like someone who can tell me who Joni Hill yes Jonah Hill s sister Jonah Hill got it good good guess because I didn t have the answer after him she was in that show um what show some Ryan Murphy show okay Leah Michelle yes they were both Ryan Murphy girls oh oh my gosh oh my gosh do you think Ryan did the connect for Leah to get her email Ryan just A A bored so he s just caused all this drama he s like you could hardly Leah Michelle first or you could hire beanie feldstein and then make double the sales and then Leo s like hey Ryan how do I get a hold of Bean anyways feldstein anyways okay anyways I m on track beanie opens the show to cold reviews cold reviews she didn t it s a big role it s their big shoes to fill and she s got tiny feet apparently anyways then beanie announces she s gon na leave the production early and then she has to leave it even earlier because she gets sick and put on vocal rest and then Jane Lynch cancels her position on the show with beanie and someone else replaces uh her and then they announced Leah Michelle is the new so do you think before they fired beanie they had Leah lined up or do you think they said I can t tell if they fired beanie or if beanie wanted out because it was not uh it was not a comfortable place for her to be long term and has Beenie responded to Leah s yes they ve all responded to it it s just kind of weird that Leah is going public with having had reached out to beanie I guess maybe she was getting a lot she s taking the role so this the bigger picture conversation that a lot of people are having in a lot of instances including the A A don t worry darling drama is the way that the media has always and will always pit women against each other because a female rivalry is something that is more you know support like the conflicts more supported in the mainstream than you know uh a friendship right and so Leah Michelle s whole thing was like enough with this beef like I don t have beef with Beanie beanie doesn t have beef with me I wrote her a letter because I can read and write and and why would Leah turn it down you know why would she turn it down it was her dream job and at some point you just have to like I wouldn t be surprised if Liam Michelle had a voodoo doll and gave beanie throat problems like I wouldn t be shocked about that but I m not I m not trying to perpetuate a female put it against female narrative you know what I m saying yeah okay so speaking of uh that movie The don t worry darling yeah yeah what was your news regarding that did you read that one well you started you sent me a tick tock about Olivia wilding out in a car and I was like I don t understand okay and then I went down a big rabbit hole because I was like she s talking about Shia who s Shia I thought she was with Harry so yes so then I went down and I watched people talking about the drama on YouTube do you understand it I think so okay so Shia was originally Harry right but Shia couldn t get along with nipples no I don t think that s the case Shia didn t have time to rehearse adequately for the role so he I thought it was beef with the Pew girl no he didn t he s paying women against each other again no Shia is a man I know I m so uh the Shia left the project and then Shia was canceled in public for being an awful abusive boyfriend yeah and when Shaya was in public being called an awful abusive boy from being sued for emotional damages Olivia Wilde came out and said she had fired him because he was toxic on her set and she will not stand for such nonsense this is another layer so that s the bat that s the difference the video comes out where she s actually begging him to come back to her culture Florence Miss flow which is demeaning as A A I think I think it s a little demeaning I think we re making a mountain out of a molehill I think it s A A up what she did to Shia LaBeouf but I don t know what she did to miss flow nipples as you call her probably more to me probably a lot more demeaning oh no am I canceled on tickets but here we are and then there s uh more drama so Olivia Wilde posts a picture of her at video Village watching Florence work and says this woman is a force of nature like I m so honored she s in my phone blah blah and Florence does not acknowledge the post does not like it does not comment on it does not reshare it and is this because is she in some sort of drama of her own or is it they are asserting that there was Dr that Olivia Wilde in Florence had bad blood on set but I have but neither woman has confirmed it but and Lawrence just isn t promoting the film in any regard Florence has promoted the film a little bit like maybe one time on Instagram she promoted it and I know that she did an interview about it because they asked her about the sex scene and she s like the sex scenes because apparently the sex scenes are very steamy and Florence said I don t think that this film should be reduced to the sex scenes it s so much bigger than that right Florence is also shooting another film right now she s shooting Dune which is probably very A A consuming probably in some butt A A nowhere when you sign up for a movie of the contract is the publicity surrounding the movie because if you don t get anyone to see the movie press has not started yet though okay it s just so it premiered at the Venice Film Festival did she show up she did oh okay she didn t make the photo call because she was on set shooting Dune though she did come for the premiere and she did walk the carpet and the whole cast took a picture together all right so that s why I feel like some of this is like trumped up charges and some of this I feel like is people reaching for things because I do feel as I m watching Tick Tock cause I m watching Snapchat it s a lot of like I need to grab your attention yeah I need to grab it fast and I need to give you facts so that you ll stay and I need to edit it hyper focused so I feel like people probably are like pulling at nothing it feels like they re definitely trying to vilify Olivia Wilde because like hella people are A A on her right and I just feel like you know for so long nobody A A on people who are A A A A like we re gon na A A on Olivia Wilde and she better be a massive asset it s a big feat to get anything made in Hollywood the amount of people that you have to answer to the amount of fires you have to put out daily the amount of work you have to go through to even get it off the ground let alone cast the project yeah it s a never ending Nightmare and you have to be assertive to be able to get something done so I m not I don t know Olivia Wilde but I m sure it was hard to get this off the ground it s yeah and you know um I feel like if Olivia Wilde s the type of woman who at the nail salon demands what she demands she probably wouldn t end up with this she wouldn t end up with the Haley Bieber A A well she might because people are saying her film is derivative and generic and she s ripped off other movies in a way that she doesn t understand well what was her last being evil student s first movie and what was that called uh book smart it was the female super bad and it did really well right yeah so you re saying this isn t getting great reviews though it s getting hot and cold reviews so Florence is getting huge praise wow the movie itself got I think like a four minute standing ovation and uh but it s getting mixed reviews so a lot of people are saying that the script is convoluted in a bad way the first comment I saw after ice because I saw like Harry kissing a guy I guess when there was a standing ovation and the very first comment was four minutes is nothing at Venice or whatever Film Festival well I mean Brendan Fraser got six minutes and started crying okay and who cares yeah I mean it s all like it s all it s all for grabs but I do struggle to believe that people are giving Olivia Wilde a fair review of her film because of how much they A A hate her and I know that they hate her because that s the whisper is all about town that she s a A A and it s just like does it make me a A A if I demand the gold glitter on my nail the way I want the gold glitter on my A A nail and Hollywood s hottest man Harry Styles doesn t help her reputation oh he doesn t oh I don t know I m saying I m asking does that not like validate her in some sort of way because he s so beloved by everyone right I don t know I don t know just asking I don t know um did you see that Harry Styles might have spit on Chris Pine when he went to sit down at the movie that s another thing that people are speculating about so Harry goes to sit down next to Chris Pine and like leans over and pauses and then like people think he spit I can t imagine because well it s a thing he does apparently it s called whaling he spits on stage or something so then Harry Styles like goes back to his like natural posture and Chris Pine looks down at his crotch and like kind of giggles and like they kind of laugh with each other so people think he might have spit on him but there s some funny memes going on about that too okay like Joe Biden what are you gon na do about this assault against America like Chris Harry Styles didn t just spit on Chris Pine he spit on the entire country it s funny stuff I did see a clip of Harry going around in his performance yeah and it looked like he was giving it uh people are saying that he s neither here nor there I mean he looked here when I saw the clip I mean it was out of context but he looked emotionally available and distraught Jesus is that about is that what we re gon na call my autobiography emotionally available in distraught if so I m charging girl I m like literally gon na cry right now what s going on I m just thinking about the people who have that cover letter right now thinking that I think it s a good idea to do something with you know what I mean like God woof okay and do I email all the people who have not responded to my email from a week and a half ago that have the typo in it like oh my God I m so sorry like here s the deal like I m actually kind of a big deal my partner doesn t like when I talk about what a big deal I am but I didn t mean to downplay it on the cover letter like you know what I mean no I leave it just checking in if the reason you re not replying is because I said I only have people who care about me it s far more than that this is why people believe me and it s because I m insecure and A A I hate me too okay we re gon na try to build you back up but what s next when are we gon na get there oh here s another thing thank God something s happening okay so do you know who Brooklyn Brooklyn Beckham is I know who his parents are right but who the A A is he dude and who s this A A he married what s her name does anyone know her name I saw that she s from money Transformers okay so her family is Rich too okay because there s no way these year olds are buying A A multi million man dollar Mansions but it s like you you know they got married right yes so why do why do we know that well why is why do we give a A A I didn t know that what does that do but what I did see is that the drama is surrounding her beef with his mom so that s when it becomes mainstream drama because everyone cares like if in our hometown if you knew about somebody who like absolutely huge falling out with their mother in law you would talk about it you talk about the girls from your hometown I feel like the girls from my hometown their drama is a lot more intriguing than my mother in law doesn t like me and most people s mothers in laws don t like them I happen to be lucky my mother in law likes me a lot that she does not respect my wishes and stop watching this show get out of here Marge mind your business um I m just kidding dude I love you it s like it is what it is and um but who I don t give a A A about this and so many people give a A A about it seems like you put it on the document because no I put it I put it on there because I m sick of A A seeing it in the news as if it s news that these two unemployed children who have millions of dollars have any kind of A A going on in their life that I should see in the Daily Mail every A A day five times I mean who cares The Daily Mail is based out of the UK David Beckham s one of the UK s biggest stars and I do feel like scandalous now like I m personally not invested yeah when I did see that I the drama so I mean from what they re saying I m sure it stems a lot further back than this but they re saying Victoria Beckham was like a bridezilla for the bride and didn t like the bride s dress and then there was like this huge beef between them it was like almost enough for me to read the whole article and then I got bored too yeah I mean when the wedding was going on people were like this is our Royal Wedding I was like it s not they re not even from here yeah like what but neither are neither would a royal wedding what do you know what I m saying like The Royal Wedding is also not that s what I m saying because they re in like they re English citizens like they re not even American Representatives but it s not ours are from the UK too that s what I m saying we re saying the same thing okay we are we are okay I m lost no you re not anyways I don t even know if I want to talk about that will you want me to not talk about I mean if you want to talk about it you can I just I don t have anything productive to add go for it if you do well do you have any thoughts on it uh the way we re teasing not that they were probably never gon na bring up not that are healthy for society I wish it wouldn t be in at the Forefront for all of us to dissect I wish they would keep it to themselves quite honestly should I say what it is go for it or should we just never say is this offense I think everyone what did they know okay well how would they know let s talk about what we re watching for this seconds We re not gon na tell them no wow go for it heavy well we re going to start up maybe we ll tell you next week got ta come back old A A news by next We re not gon na talk about it next week you re never gon na know but guess in the comment section what you think

and scared and alone how did you find something like this so it s a showcase where people go and they re like I have these projects I m working on yeah everyone watched the rough cut and what give me notes yeah that I thought there was going to be notes like I thought there was going to be a discourse afterwards where people are like this worked for me this didn t work for me but like none of that and everybody was like super drunk and like really high and I was like oh this is adding to my discomfort but when I think back on it it s like thank God they were really drunk and really high because like I was you know what I mean like I was not well about what I was just nervous as A A vulnerable to show your work vulnerable to share my unfinished work so it s like I m putting my like shittiest foot forward and then also like I m alone here and so like you know when I m alone I get weird and so the first choice I made was like I m gon na lean it s in a backyard so I got there really early and I was just sitting in my car waiting for it to not be like the first A A there but it s like I was the first A A there and I m sitting in my car I didn t realize my lights were on but I m just like aggressively picking my nose and then a couple comes up to me they go are you leaving it s like my fingers in my nose and I was like no no no and then I realized I should turn my lights off and then I get there and someone s trying to get in and I was like oh this is how you open the door like did you not get the email like I m being a A A but it s like I m joking but it s like ah strangers don t know you so when you do it progress realizing when you re doing something oh I didn t stop though okay they kept going so this poor man I m like this is how we get a new A A idiot and then we re in and then I m like well I don t know what to do with my body now and I beeline for a tree I go for a tree because the tree feels safe and I just perch on it I perch on a tree branch in the back of the A A there s like open chairs and I perch on a tree and then it s like don t leave the tree because then they ll know you re insecure so you got to be secure about the choice you made to be on the trees to stay on the train you have no friends there not a single A A friend you re brave thank you you re really Brave I ve been trying to push myself out of my comfort zone and even I wouldn t do that well because in my I m like I need to network I need to meet people I need to expand my horizons and like figure out people to collaborate like make a community blah blah like no you can t make a film alone like whatever some perched on this A A tree like a A A and then I realized I got ta leave this tree I can t stay on this A A tree so I go and I sit in the back road next to the guy that I came in with and I was like can I sit here and he s like yeah that s fine and so we re sitting there and we re like kind of having small talk and he s showing something that night too and then someone goes oh you guys can t sit here these are reserved to see the two signs in the A A back row yeah literally signs across it that just say reserved and I looked at him was like well way to go you really A A me on this one and he s just like I m sorry I m just like oh man was he alone too yeah he was wow yeah joke no it was flat and awkward and it s like it was bad and then we go we go sit in the different row together together this guy s still sticking it through with you I don t even like I got ta go pee and then when I came back from the bathroom I would have been on the other I also watched him try to sit somewhere not next to me but by this point all the seats had been taken and the only option was next to me so this poor man had to sit next to me or he could have gone to the tree whatever so he sits down next to me and then I didn t realize this but everybody had prepared like a sketch before their screening so it s a comedy show where you show unfinished work it was really funny everybody was really funny so before you present your work you lead in with like a comedy sketch no like a minute but like still like that s a lot vocally or yeah like vocally like a team went up and they did like an AI bit where they had it then AI chat bot introduce them with them it was a whole A A thing but then everyone started talking about Ai and then I was like oh this is great I have ai things to talk about because I have those AI images of my dog breastfeeding off of my titties so I ll I ll test it you got mad at me last week for saying I aroused your dog on accident but you re talking about breastfeeding your animals it s different okay it s different so like then he s like he s like so what s your like what s your big goal and I was like oh I really just want to breastfeed my dogs you know what yep that was what I stuck with all night all night everyone s hearing about how I want to breastfeed my dogs and then I say oh speaking of AI art here s the picture and I m showing them the AI art of me breastfeeding my dogs but it s not just one picture it s A A five and I m showing them all five and then they re gone Music so that s how that went did you make any contacts I will be vlogging with one of the people I saw there what yeah two guys had Vlogs go up that were really funny and I don t think they re vloggers but they re very funny so I m like gon na Vlog with them wow yeah okay yeah one of them was very high and I haven t heard from him since but the other one we made we made plans okay what are you guys gon na Vlog about we re gon na go hiking oh cheating on me again well we re but we re vlogging it it s not like a chill girl hike it s like it s work it s a working girl it s work because his Vlog was really funny he was like I was really depressed over Christmas so I hiked Mount Baldy and I would not recommend you do that because it is very dangerous and then he like watches uh whatever there I ve I ve vlogged this night too so you can see it okay but it was uh you know I was in rare form it s a whole vibe okay okay well I have to stop hiking because I m convinced that s all I ve been doing are you kidding me turn that phone over okay I m also just shocked by hour of work I m shocked by the name I m seeing on my phone because it s like I m cc d on a text between Joe and James and this other guy and the other guy Joe and James hate because they had a poor business deal with him so the fact that I just got a text message between all of those people makes me like who s gon na die because someone is it s a hateful thing moving on okay and does anyone want to see a picture of me breastfeeding my dogs no okay I m sure you ve already shown I m just checking so what s going on with your lights and your security precautions oh no this is just a little bit of an annoyance it s not even really a story it s just it drives me A A Bonkers when ever I I like that everything is very secure online when you re trying to get into things but my biggest pet peeve my biggest security caution pet peeve is when they do that thing where it pops up like nine images and they ask you to pick them up or pick the light I have never successfully been able to pick the stop lights in the picture and it drives me A A crazy because I know my password do a two step verification I don t need to pick the stoplight because I can t find the stop lights and I m sitting there and I m like have somebody on the phone trying to do taxes and it s like hold on I got ta pick these stop lights and I m like it takes me three minutes and I still get it wrong you re not gon na like pick the building with stairs it s like well one s a two story building so I assume there are stairs inside of it do you want me to go that far am I supposed to take the leap from external to Interior in regards to the stair workout or do I just pick the one where you can see the stairs and I want to know who successfully can achieve these things I mean not us like and like how about also like just ask like am I a robot like A A no exactly like or like who cares if I am A A like who honestly who cares if I am what is the harm if I am can you sell me because really I can t think of one okay it just seems like a better existence just programmed to do one thing and you don t have to wonder about all the other things you know what I m saying I m having a rough day all right let s talk about it we can t not here not now not like this in front of Chris okay instead let s just talk about the cost of groceries Rising oh my God that is part of why I m so upset though have you noticed have you noticed no I don t agree Chris I have do you create like what in the A A bro at last last week I made a clam chowder for A A dollars I bought canned clams and a potato and that A A Sam that soup something dollars hellofresh is sounding real good hello precious sounding real A A good right now I bought one tomato on Sunday guess how much the Tomato cost Chris you know you ve seen the docket guess how much that tomato cost I don t know A A cents I was checking out at the counter and I was like oh no this is wrong that s what I thought I was like this is wrong so I straight up I m at the self checkout I void it the woman has to come over she goes like oh let me take the tomato and I go no I still want the Tomato but obviously something s wrong with me yeah yeah she goes no I go what she s like well that s the cost per pound I was like it s a tomato and it is not a pound what yeah I ve heard eggs are wild right now dude eggs are A A wild and they re missing they were sold out at Costco the last three times I got them at Costco for I have eggs in my fridge of course you do this is not the flex you want to be making right now by the way that s not what people like the night bridge and I don t even know how much they cost no that one I know is seven to nine dollars yeah and that is nuts uh right now it does feel good to be all those mommies in Colorado that have chickens Yeah in our neighborhood I bet I just can t trust chickens because of that whole vent situation it just stresses me out we ve talked about this they have one hole to rule them all and I m not into it it A A me up okay but that doesn t change the egg you re getting from the store versus the egg you re getting from the woman no but it s like it becomes more my business okay and that s not something I ever I can t think about eggs while I m eating them or it ruins the experience anyways like I have to pretend I m not eating an egg when I m cooking an egg yeah and I need it to be burned don t look and then just shove it down in your mouth yeah and burn the A A out of it and I also put like cheese and salsa in it like my egg is not really an egg and the only reason I m eating the eggs is because it s one of the only things that I can cook that s semi healthy it s just like a lot of protein yeah cholesterol exactly it s like it s that or I m just having sugar for breakfast and like obviously I need the protein because I m a mess okay but I did just want to like point out your hypocrisy of like you re pissed about the tomato but you re fine dropping every day for lunch I don t drop our salad at La pank I know that s but that s not every day A A and then I m on a budget now for another seven dollars I I mean I did get a tart for six dollars I did do that the prizes here are wild and I like but that s why I was like I m like I go I I don t go to lunch every day right I get a lunch okay a week you know what I mean because I have something I ve been missing in my life are the salads that are accessible to me in California because after I work out like I want a nice healthy lunch that s gon na like push me forward in the right direction and they have those here but I swear even since I was here last time a salad went from to year on average paying for a salad for lunch here and they don t give you enough dressing and then they charge you for the dressing you re crazy about your dressing I mean someone s got a baby she had four dressings and then she said well do you think I d get another one the other day let s talk about the Browns and I m like can you just start eating it I m not eating this dry salad I m like you have four things of dressing they weren t the right dressing and that was on me that was on me honestly I I didn t know had I known I would have asked for the specific dressing at the gates unfortunately I did not know so I had to wait for it I m so excited to be working with Factor America s

privately about you being gaslit by your contractors well we didn t even really talk about it we were on a hike and I was working the whole time I was not working I was putting like fire he s like sending voicemails yeah they re cheats and liars and they ve been saying things to me and I caught them in it the other day and Lizzy didn t know it wasn t the roofing company and she s like what is going on yeah I was like what s the hot sauce because it s my roofing company I m like oh my God this is so boring like give me something good what s Chris lying about no I m being gaslit no we should talk about it I m glad that you ve come to terms with this because I really think you should fire this company well it s it s not like I ve paid them up front so it s not like I m even it s just you re just wasting time and getting enraged yes and so fire that it s crazy because like out of all things I should be enraged about it shouldn t be over somebody we re paying tons and tons of money to fix a project for and I had met with five different roofing companies these people promised the world they had the best reviews they showed all of these things they cut his balls exactly and that s why I said you ve got the job and instead of the one section we re just gon na do the whole roof with you guys because the A A was so great yeah and it s there like this job will be done in seven to ten days it s been days and I think they ve worked for a total of seven hours and I am playing babysitter every day I m like where wait we ll be there in the next hour okay a crew will be there too and I m calling and I m calling and I just keep getting gas lit and then I catch them in lies and then the biggest update now is that I ve probably got into a vocal altercations with all of the four men so the they stopped showing up to my house and now the boss is calling me directly and I m like well I m catching you guys in lies and so it really sounds to me at this stage they should be fired I know but I ve already met with five other roofers and they weren t great options either I mean it s not easy out here when you haven t been lied to and swindled by that torrential downpour yeah in California and everyone s roofs are tested everyone needs their roofs repaired right so on Friday night he finally promises me the world he s like we re gon na have a crew there at am I said well I m not waking up at A M for a crew not to show up so a crew better be at my house at am I wake up there s no crew here I text him I call him no response and then the boss calls me and he goes I m so sorry their truck broke down in Santa Clarita because they were getting materials I was like you don t need materials today you ve already done the the part that needs materials now you re replacing the tiles that are already existing on my roof so a why are they in Santa Clarita and if their truck s really broken down I want a picture because I can no longer give you the benefit of the doubt because I ve caught you in seven or eight lies and instead of sending me a picture he was like okay I ll have a crew there in an hour and I was like if they re not I want that picture and if not you re fired and he was like did the crew come the crew came and they worked all day on Saturday and he said next week you re gon na be like all of our other customers and you re gon na love us because we re gon na be there all day every day is going to be done they ve just been traumatizing you and really great with everyone else that s what I said and I m like that s not the word choice my guy and a lot of times they d be like we have other roofs I was like I don t care what other rules you have you shouldn t have taken me on if you don t have the wherewithal to do it so it s just like I mean I m not like they ve gotten like an eighth of what like it is to do the roof so it s not like they ve been paid for this I ve just been like upset all day every day because I keep getting lied to and I keep waiting around for nobody to show up yeah I mean as long as I I it is nice to know there s been progress since because at our hike I was like yeah fire these people it s just not that easy I mean I believe you I ve never tried to redo a roof I don t even know what are you redoing a roof Chris oh my God yeah it s a nightmare um what are you doing I don t know how do you know how to redo a roof I I don t whose roof are you redoing you re a renter can you hear me yeah okay um no my uh my dad has a property in Lancaster and he s pre stroke he like would take care of everything like he would he himself like if anything broke he would fix it roof related carpets tiles whatever he can fix literally anything all the time and so there was a problem with the roof and he had a stroke and he can t do it anymore so kind of just like it was either going to be a billion dollars to fix or we had to figure it out and we didn t have the money to do that so I was like but how do you know how to do a roof YouTube I I I don t my dad has a guy that he hired often that worked with him very closely and he kind of knows how to do it and so we re really taking this guy s lead but I m helping him so you re like his crew essentially you re like how taking his lead yeah yeah do anything and put the YouTube if my roof wasn t so high I d probably try it just for like the Vlog of it all but it s real like if I If I Stumble talks like that what for the Vlog of it all I ll risk my life for the Vlog no I m saying I won t if my roof was like if this was a one story house that was like a reasonable height from the ground I d be up there trying but I I m not going up that no it is though the most exhausting thing I ve maybe ever done like I m in so much pain and I m so tired are you learning yes but I I m so like I ve always had respect for people that did jobs like that but now more than ever oh yeah it s a lot physically demanding yeah it s yeah my God it s I can t do it my my frail homosexual body wasn t built for this okay Lizzy are you getting stoned again or like what s going on why are you like thinking about your dogs in this way this is only a thought I would have if I was so stunned off my ass I m like the life of a dog a dog that s fair it s because and I m worried about your like fake wine problem what it s a lot is it you re looking up fake wine bars you re no that Woody Harrelson thing came into my Instagram feed oh okay yeah I m not looking up fake wine bars but also it s fake wine I mean I ll go it looks fun right yeah anyway I was I m not getting high but I was eating my breakfast this morning and bubs was begging like a A A and then I realized like this A A was like lose his marbles if I was doing to him what he s doing to me so it s the hypocrisy of it all for me like honestly if I went up to him while he was eating his food and I started like jumping on his A A ass and like scream yeah he s ski he yells at me when I walk by him well he owns you whatever you need to set boundaries I m fine boundaries with their animals are narcissists okay well speaking of boundaries Riley has none and I told her no and she s and I told that lanky beautiful A A to get the A A off me and she was like no my dad s a narcissist oh this is fine we re still working on her boundaries but she s hard it s hard because she has so much energy and she like she does like just body slam people when they show up because she s so she like socked me in the face with her snoot this morning I was like Jesus A A I have makeup on and your snood is damp God damn but I love her so much I mean someone has to but you get what I m saying like it s the hypocrisy of it all for me oh yeah yeah your dog if you wouldn t tried to take their food while they were eating they wouldn t like it no I mean oh it s A A wild what are these dogs thinking exactly they re thinking they want all the delicious nasty food that we re putting into our bodies like he wants My Salsa eggs that don t look like eggs anyway that was just a thought I had I thought maybe we could commiserate didn t realize you re gon na call me a drug addict on TV I didn t I did not say live television don t act I m worried about you that one I m not actually do you drink grape juice and play Catan on Saturdays till p m it s Reckless no I commend you for like being as social as you are putting yourself in social situations with being sober thank you that would be very hard for me to do that s what like when I was leaving that event it s like God damn of course I used to do Molly before leaving the house this is A A awful you need a little A A ecstasy in meth to get through something like that I don t think we should be promoting that I m just saying if anyone s taking a press pill in the last years they ve done math let s not A A joke about it I mean kid ourselves yeah you re not if x if you re taking ecstasy you re taking meth because it s laced with yeah don t do drugs don t do drugs okay they re bad okay just say no okay okay these were like alt um do you want to talk about the I mean we don t need to talk about our crosswalk incident I mean you said put that on the notes and so I did well I don t even remember what the vibe was that you were were you mad at me because you thought I was costing a mana s life well I was driving right but you blamed it on me really quickly see how that works it s like your fault I was driving and you put me at fault because we re driving there s a crosswalk coming up and Lizzy goes that s my favorite and I m looking and then the next thing I look over and I m in the middle crosswalk and a guy s just like giving me a thumbs up like super sarcastically yeah and I was like I m an awful person but also that seemed like a death wish that guy because it s like he wanted to walk into that it was a weird choice we re on Ventura Boulevard a busy Street and he s walking against the light on a busy A A Street he wanted to die and that s on that and that s all done I m glad we brought that up okay before we get into hot topics and I know this doesn t relate to you but we ve been watching a lot of RuPaul Drag Race and so I just get so curious about how it s so smooth and there s nothing oh the penis region the yeah the tucking of it all yeah so I ve been watching tucking tutorials wow and it really makes my stomach turn yeah it s a lot like I don t have balls and I feel I feel some type of way watching they stuff the actual do you know what this is Chris break it down break it down have you ever looked into this genre I mean I ve heard about it I know vaguely about it walk us through it step by step how do we talk I don t know details so your balls dropped from your body they came from a canal and so there you can push the balls back into your body where they like had dropped down from with these A A their balls back up into tubes that exist into your body so you re like pushing you re pushing and it goes up and then you push your other so you have both your balls in separate tunnels inside of your body tunnels how many times in separate how many tunnels does a man have wait is that real a tunnel isn t the medical word but if you like it it just sounds like you guys are hella sneaky very like and well have you ever been like having sex before or if you re on your back your ball like or if you re like about to ejaculate and your ball kind of goes up has that ever happened to you and you re like oh if I m ever like having sex or jacking off and that happens to me I have to like push it back out or it s so uncomfortable no no so every once in a while my balls will fall into this let s call it canal or rise into it and yeah these drag queens they re sticking them up in there then they re taking duct tape and they tape the shaft behind they re not putting duct tape directly on their penis skin are they yeah well I don t know if it s duct tape moving tape but it s got ta keep it there but they re putting it directly on their flesh so one goes and then you tuck it in between one butt cheek and then you go the opposite and tuck it in between the other butt cheek and they re just tucked up like that looking smooth as ever wow can I just say as a woman I m not that smooth like you don t have to try that hard well they get deducted uh points from the Judgment we re having A A lips if it s a meaty tuck what Music I just want to come out as an advocate for meaty tucks as Khloe Kardashian identifies as a big A A A A and I stand with her as an ally to the drag Community like big A A are a thing let s bring a meaty tuck back wow so much respect to this I mean I m not Tech when I I guess I m not a drag queen but like I think let me let my dick fly you look beautiful as Daphne by the way thank you like really really beautiful wow thank you I m upset I didn t get to play with you while you looked like that I mean I love working with you and you re a little bit dragged out it s kind of everything I get it Cher keeps saying he thinks I could be on drag race and I m like I have to get good at makeup and I m not as much of like I don t think I d excel in these comedy challenges I think you don t realize how funny you are when you are that A A because you honestly you would fail at RuPaul Drag Race I don t even think you d be accepted into the nominations of it like they would they would screen your video and be like well no if I got good at makeup I do think I could contend I don t Laughter why it s the tucking it s the dancing it s the healing I can dance can you wear heels like that yes I am great in heels what are you talking I want you to prove the heels to me I can prove the heels to you okay if you can prove the heels to me I ll walk it back some some but not entirely I m gon na make it my life s mission to get on RuPaul s Drag Race for the Vlog of it all well no it would be reality TV if it all it d be filmed as is I love it okay I would die if you were on that I would support you every step of the way I m sure you would I would I would want you to succeed would be sick moving on to Hot Topics do you want to talk about Julia Fox s house tour of course I do this is the one Tick Tock I ve ever sent to you I know and I almost you didn t send it to me you made me go find it on my own you just brought it up I guess I just commentated about it at you yeah and then once it came on your for you page then you joined in on the conversation eight hours Well everybody s having the conversation now well oh they are yeah okay I ve seen multiple tick tocks on different people s podcasts about the topic I mean she s doing something right she got the whole world talking about her again yeah what s going on with those eyebrows she bleaches them why she made a tick tock one time being like men hate these so I keep doing it she s right I hate it I mean I hate it too and I m not a man but like I feel like there s a lot of interesting things happening in Julia s corner and it s like good for her because she s made something out of nothing but the the whole vibe of this I m like every man Tick Tock with this like apartment in New York that s probably grand a month I mean we don t know her financial status like yes I don t think she s very rich well and that s what I I mean I don t know her net worth obviously when you Google somebody s net worth it s never even close to her I wish I had my Google she s had uh some really great career moments but I don t know if that amounts to like a ton of financial stability and so I did see when I scrolled uh the comments it was just like yes I opened Tick Tock for this because I wanted to see how people were reacting and it was just like everyone was like wow the most relatable celebrity ever like this is country pictures of her and all her girlfriends with their Hermes bags at her birthday I don t know you re kidding big displays of wealth does she have an air mass bag yeah that was Kanye s birthday present to her was buying her and all her A A like Birkins or something and so there s like multiple pictures of her and all her girlfriends like holding Birkins she doesn t like big displays of wealth but every time she went on a date with Kanye she had a A A news article about it complete with pictures about all the wealthy things they did yeah I don t like big displays of wealth but I do only go on for States on previous how you love the attention and that s fine stick the knife in and turn it it s like you could have given us everything you did without that little jab towards excessive displays of wealth which you do do so like what are you like a begging dog or something I mean listen it was Brave to show the current state of her house because yeah I would never I mean my house looks like that too so like maybe the reason why I look like I m poor is because I also don t like big displays as well but I I mean that apartment is very nice by New York standards but honestly and the rent probably is like grand for an apartment right it s a nice one bedroom apartment yeah I m not talking about the size or the status of the apartment I m talking about what fills the apartment and it s right everything everywhere yeah she s got a kid okay you re right yeah okay it s a pretty normal Abode I ll say Brave on her though for just showing it as his even I would tidy a little I don t know that I could do that I don t even do that for my Vlog sometimes I m like oh A A and they see all the trash on the counters whatever this might be the nicest you ve ever been to Julia Fox I mean I m being nice but it s also like I I don t care all right Anna delvey oh wait what no I can t even remember whatever I continue it wasn t Sorkin who could ever really say I couldn t honestly well I think she s going by delvey because her Show s going to be called like dinner with delvie but Vogue like went to her house and like did a little house tour with her I loved oh my gosh is it up yeah it s on Tick Tock you re kidding me no I saw the picture of her out on her balcony with the house arrest bracelet on her ankle and I was like Chic she s like I stopped a doodling when I was in prison but I could only have this size papers it s crazy because literally last week when we were hiking I was like don t you ever just miss annadelvy yeah and then literally that day this is a A A simulation it came out that she was in talks for this reality show and I was like God is good I think we re past talks what I think we re past talks I think it s happening oh or maybe she s conned me I don t know because honestly she is the one talking about it but I would say this A A is a businesswoman if anything because business is nothing but a long con she is also writing a book and she s partnered with Benham Murray Brunner Murray for uh a docu series of her life post prison so she s got three big projects in the work and I did see a lot of people online being like well is this giving uh criminals a platform here s the deal my dick gets so hard for what Anna dalby almost accomplished as a A A immigrant woman in the A A Financial District of New York that s run by A A big ball dumb A A men so good for A A you Anna get that A A coin take it all take all their A A money A A there is nothing more empowering than what she did she went in there and played their A A game in their A A faces and they can suck her ass about it yeah I mean she could have gone and she has no shame in her game she s not doing a A A reality show about it non vogue talking about her time she spent in prison good for A A you A A go get it yeah I mean I I m not a fan of criminality it gives me anxiety personally but I do love a person who A A goes out there and does it I think everybody that s trying to make a successful business does to an extent what she did I think she just had opportunities to take it to the extreme and she took it there yeah I think she did her time I think if somebody s knocking on your door with opportunities and money who would you be to turn it down so it s not like also giving these criminals a platform it s like if you were in her seat you would also be saying yes to all of these things and also she was a step away from making it actually a successful business after all the lies and if there s anything I ve learned like in this industry alone it s the A A guys who are lying the hardest to get the farthest and that makes me A A crazy because I can t stand it yeah but there they go yeah and here I am you know what I m saying you re probably the most honest successful person I know you want to do a round of applause for that because honestly I m so proud of you Applause I mean even in Hollywood it s like to get a movie or a series Mage you have to kind of like go to your financiers and be like well I have this big actress attached to the project and then the actress isn t attached but you re like oh but I got all this financing to the actress and you re like oh actress I have all this financing now so it s like everyone s like playing these moving Parts making promises hoping it will all come together so that they can make an explosion it s hard to make big things happen in this world and I think like she had a few missteps and trying to make something big happen for herself and I think of course she s getting these deals because there s huge interest and I am curious to see her life from her perspective everything else that s been about her has been other people s uh narratives about her from more of her victims standpoint right and I do admit yeah she has victims but like specifically okay well I feel bad for like some of the the girl who paid for the Morocco trip the girl the girl but these big corporations if Anna Delphi hadn t taken advantage of that girl that girl would have never had a book made and that was her dream so you know everything happens for a reason yeah write another book girl let s see how it does because without Anna I don t know if it s gon na do very and here s the thing do I love Anna Devi or do I love what I know of her so it s going to be interesting to see like I hope this dinner with delvie is everything I m hoping it will be I think if you saw the tick tock of her walking you through her apartment in New York you d be like yeah I love that A A I ll be edging I don t trust her like I m scared as A A like I wan na I I Aspire for the confidence level do you know what I mean we want to have dinner with Delvin yeah like I well I don t know I m scared because I am I m a little emotionally susceptible to conning uh and I and I do want what s best for everyone so like I could really easily be taking a minute but like love what you re doing I would like to take the positive elements of it and uh leave the criminal elements of it right all right so gma I ve been following this story so heavily it s Good Morning America the third hour never had I ever watched it until this Scandal erupted oh the co hosts that are in love yes so they had they left the show right well yeah so two co hosts were on the show they were both married and this has nothing to do with it the third pinky was just that was an arbitrary lift well that was their third co host that like I don t know what s gon na happen really we re fired yeah but she s out of this awkward the two co hosts yeah gma or maybe that s just the third hour maybe I m spreading fake news anyways I know about the two they were both married but sad A Love Affair on the show as A A they were married both of them were married I didn t know they were married and I m just like why does anyone care like this is a sweet story and so one of these I can t remember who broke the story but they had followed them for months and got pictures of them every time they were out are you here yeah I m listening okay they got pictures of them every time they were out publicly kissing and they did drop this story with all these photos and everything erupted because it s like crazy these two people are married their co hosts on a huge platform married to other people yeah and so then uh GMA went on as usual like without addressing anything like with pictures of them were kissing and they re just like for like for the rest of how long for like five days I think it was like two or three days and then they suspended them and now news just broke the ABC has fired them and it just to me begs the question of like should somebody get fired for a romance in the workplace I mean the cheating is really none of their employer s business it s the workplace romance right and I don t stand by infidelity at all like it really does just earn me on another level but from an employment level like if Chris cheats on his boyfriend with somebody else like I m not firing I m gon na have to ask her to live for you asking I m just the third co host the little pinky on the end next to the ring so what do you think um I mean my opinion changes now that I know that they re married but I also that s none of their employer s business well if you think about what they do they kind of are like the face of a show called Good Morning America right uh that s under the understanding that there s a Code of Ethics and morality that comes from a person that delivers the news and I do think that there become it becomes a little bit hard to hear someone providing news information on a lighthearted show when you remember that they re A A each other and have wives and husbands at home and for me I m just saying from like a rating standpoint I am not well I m not the demographic of gma right I had never tuned into gma yet here I am watching gma seeing like they re getting fired if they re gon na well it s just like this crazy Whirlwind of a story and I understand like ABC was probably thinking well this is disrupting our Newsroom all of our employees are more interested in what everyone else is saying about these co hosts than working but I do think that would die down like I just don t know if I would stand by like if I was an executive I don t know if I could like fire people for having had fallen extra Affairs because the show does like we couldn t do this show if we had chemistry I don t know if I was straight like I mean that s not what I m saying like I could co host a show with a gay guy and not fall in love with him and still be sound in my marriage but it s just like I don t know there s obviously chemistry between the two of them obviously they made a misstep they had sworn that they I don t know I mean I would have a very different opinion of it if they were two single individuals but I also am like I always fall on the edge because it s all it s hard like I met Joe working with him right and uh but I don t know like in different in different venues it s like I don t want my workplace to feel like that you know what I m saying like I don t like I used to go to an acting class and it felt like people were flirty and treating it like a dating pool and it s like well the assumption is that I m a man and you re a woman and we have chemistry so let s see where that chemistry takes us and at first I was like oh maybe I m just being sensitive like I don t know and then I heard from like a bunch of other women that they had been A A by a bunch of these men and I m just thinking like I don t know dude like that s this seems inappropriate yeah like it s a time and place thing pick a time and place to do your flirty fornicating you know and that s not at work yeah and then when I took when I was I m actually going to tell the story of how I met Joe but it s like we weren t in an official workplace but I had decided I was obsessed with him before I showed up and then I was inappropriate so I m a little bit of a hypocrite like a begging dog over here but like I do also feel very strongly that had I not received go signals from him and had I not like there was there was always a flirty Vibe between the two of us if you had different jobs and those were your nine to five jobs that was your main source of income and you were both stuck there and you both agreed like oh this is something we can t deny it would be very hard to turn that off because of your job like yeah but I m saying leave your spouse of course yeah like leave your spouse and go about this in a different way because otherwise we would all just be batting our eyes like oh that was fast you know what I mean if they got together post divorce but the fact that they re in married relationships they re the face of a show they re supposed to represent most of America right and most of Americans aren t really lit up by infidelity yeah no and I do think if I was the head boss at ABC I would think well this is one hurdle we can get over it like we ll get over this like maybe a frenzy but then what if they start having issues or what if they start and it s like it is almost like something s gon na boil to the top and there s going to be an explosion so why not make the change now before having to do it later down yeah but it is crazy I mean I don t know I mean also being a spouse and knowing that my husband was still on air with the woman that he was with instead of me and just be like I might have to burn that building down I might have to go into gma and just light it all up okay you put on this document that Meghan Trainor is pregnant with her second child not good for her was there anything poignant for you it s just cute like look at us on these streets not even one child and Megan s already on number two yeah she and she s only I was reading this one we re gon na talk about how Meghan Trainor s doing it wow she has this hit song she s having her second baby and her first baby s a little ginger boy and she s writing a book as well which I do like the title of it s called dear future mama so just good for Meghan Trainor uh Paris Hilton also just announced that she had she has a baby yeah I mean I think a lot of people that do IVF and surrogacy it s like you just don t nothing s for certain until it s certain so why get the world ramped up in in the case that something like devastating were to happen it s like I understand you wouldn t want to live that publicly until it s here but then little boy do you know his name I don t I haven t looked that far into it can you see if we know his name and then you put this Harry Style splits his trousers in front of crush Jennifer Aniston yeah so Jennifer Aniston I suppose is uh who Harry Styles had his first like real major crush on how do you know that because he told the world oh and he split his pants pretty A A aggressively at his show that she was at though I also have to say there is a really funny group of women who are like older that are really into Harry Styles like desperately into him I think their world s desperately into him I know but it s like it s funny when it s like Jennifer Aniston and like the ma the mom from Modern Family Julie something uh Bowen Bowen yeah I know a Julie Bolton so I get confused with her name but anyway she s obsessed with him too and she keeps showing up with these posters that are like I may be an older woman but that means I know what I m doing and she s like in the pit dancing with the super fans it is so fascinating to me that like Jennifer Aniston like disrupted her whatever night to just like go sit at a Harry Styles concert well no they re having a blast I well I don t doubt that it s just fast like if I was Harry Styles and Jennifer Aniston was like spending a night yeah to go to a concert in a public Arena to watch me perform yeah I just I would be beside myself no and then his pants split some mortifying you know I mean I don t think it s mortifying I think it s a little mortified really yeah I don t there s even a beat of him looking at her like like you know for those of you who are Audio Only it s like do you think Harry Styles has the confidence to like go all the way with Jennifer Aniston I would be so intimidated like she s such a Powerhouse of a woman that I just would be like nothing would be enough and like yes Mommy how would you please like if you didn t like it would you d have to be so confident in your sexual abilities to like take on going over to Jennifer Aniston s house dude you might he might just go into like blackout sicko mode like what I m saying and it s just like it s on I m gay and it would be like that scenario from last week s advice though where it s like one pump on the dry hump and I m out yeah I m sorry man I got ta go I got ta go sorry Jen I m out no I would not tell Jennifer Aniston that I have pumped in my pants but you would leave you wouldn t spend the night in your statement no she s making two Milli an episode for the morning show God A A bless her with inflation she should she somebody has to buy those eggs yeah how s she afford those tomatoes that shit s expensive there s no way she s eating non organic she needs that too yeah her tomatoes are probably like a lot more than she probably grows them in her own garden she grows them no her and Reese they were making a million an episode on the morning show and then when they renegotiated for this next season yeah they re each at million per episode I got ta say something that I I m not I don t love having to detract from Reese Witherspoon because I really love her I can t I can not entertain this even for a second okay can you just a little bit no no no no there will no be there will be no reason that s why it s not a strong stands for me on this podcast it s not a strong thing that I m saying it s it s like a weak little like you know what I mean like it s like I m like flicking her a little bit she s like the most powerful woman in Hollywood I know and I love her and I love the work that she s doing and she posted this thing on Tick Tock trying to make it look like she works with the women at her company Hello Sunshine by bringing them in cakes to celebrate like a million somethings or whatever but it s like you can tell these women don t know each other s names oh yeah it s an awkward watch and she s like all right everybody eat the cake hey quick no eat the cake and it s like I don t know that you ve been in this room before ever or that you know any of these women s names let alone what they do at the company you started and that s fine but it was a really weird display of I m like one of you but I don t but I don t know how to be like watch and decide for myself I ll show you it we don t get a break today so we ll never you ll never know how he feels about this tiktok doesn t take away from the wonderful work that she s doing yeah she really has been able to transform her life yeah and her company is a majority women if not all women so I think that s all very positive but this was to me the first time I ever was like it s just crazy that to me she went from being an actress a successful actress to being able to be the rule like the master of her own destiny like she really has taken control and like one upped everything yeah I just I think it s so important big fan of her um I have paris s kid s name what is that uh paris s baby is London Marilyn Hilton London Maryland Hilton sounds like something from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody it s a lot London London hey London London she said Marilyn is after her grandmother London because it s her favorite city and she thinks that Paris and London sound cute together they do it s a lot of names though London Maryland Hilton Rio Paris wait Paris is one of his names no it s London Maryland Hilton room Paris no Paris is her name okay okay what is this no pants Trend that you ve been saying you can t stand I can t stand it what do you mean it s a trend people are like I Kendall Jenner didn t wear any pants so I m not gon na wear any pants help me style this look with no pants and it s like put some A A pants on it s the middle of winter it s cold put some A A pants on why do things on the woman on women women s anatomy bother you it s not women s not amazed it is you re not wearing pants in public if a man wasn t wearing pants I also would have a problem with it but men are wearing pants so I m not upset about it do you see it just seems like you get really upset about clothing choices yeah I would like people to cover their bodies in public why I don t want to get comfortable looking at penises vaginas and nipples out in the real world you re such a prude are you do you want to see penises and vaginas and nipples out in the real world do you want the person making your A A McDonald s to have their nipple and A A and penis out I mean food industry I think there should be a uniform okay I think if you re Kendall Jenner walking to Earth Cafe to get paparazzi take those pants off wow okay I mean it s just like there s two kinds of people in this world you guys one without a person and one s with pants that Food Service employee can also be without pants I just hope it s while they re not preparing food yeah I mean for me I m just like put some A A pants on why because I would like you to have pants on it s too much to not have pants you know what I mean we re just eroding everything until there s nothing okay but weren t you a girl that was a fan of like the gray sweatpants where you could see the outline of people s dicks no but it was fun to scream talk about how big Jon Hamm s penis is and also he s wearing pants he s wearing sweatpants okay okay God bless all you girls who aren t wearing pants I hope your daughter comes home one day and I was like Daddy I m not wearing pants anymore well when she s she can make those decisions for herself and you re gon na love it no she can make decisions for herself when she s your little sister comes home she s been on a date she s not wearing any pants how do you feel about that I d probably be like you should put some pants on but she s my sister right so I see all women as my sisters and the point being Witherspoon making a tick tock no I just was flicking her I was just giving her a little flick okay yeah okay maybe get to know your employees I don t know just saying that being said thank God she wears pants okay what s going on with Jay Leno oh I just thought it was funny that funny I know it s dark Jay Leno has that TV show like Jay s garage because he s like you know he s a big car guy a big like vehicle guy I guess more than just cars yeah um but it s just it s like one major accident after the next for him on this show like literally there was a huge fire in his garage and he got horrible Burns all over his bottom of that and then he gets well from that and goes back to shooting this the show and falls off a motorcycle breaks his A A collarbone his ribs like a bunch of A A and then they re like we can t make this show we re gon na kill National Treasure Jay Leno so they canceled the show they canceled the shop but it s just like that s like the amount of accidents it took and the amount of actual really A A up damage to this man s body before they were like maybe we shouldn t kill Jay Leno on National Television take a step back from this I mean I applaud them for that he s he should just live happily I think he is living happily but it s like he didn t set himself on fire when it was just like his time right I don t know maybe it was just his time I could be my production can t be responsible for something like that oh I thought I had glasses on I just been trying to push them up my face and like what is going on okay I didn t click on this link Academy accounting conducting oh so they announced the nominees for Oscars the Oscars which you and I don t give a A A about sorry um have you seen Puss in Boots no I haven t seen A A have you seen any of these movies yes I ve seen five five of them I have four to see still which ones have you seen I m excited so you re watching all the best picture nominations or which I I always the best picture of the ones that I feel like I have to watch before it comes that s like the most important one to me and then if I have time I go to like best actor actress movies and like I I normally don t have time for all that but I try at least the best pictures and the ones that I ve seen are avatar The Way of the water the Banshees of insurance incredible um Elvis uh I I loved but I love azler and even like the movies that people hate I just like his style I don t know they re fun uh everything everywhere at once is insane and I love it um and top gun Maverick was so good is it nominated for an Oscar nominated for Best Picture their cinematographer Claudia Miranda was not nominated oh wait that s insane right that makes Justice for Claudio what yeah that s like the best part I know and justice for James Cameron he wasn t nominated as best director even though it was nominated for best picture it s wild when that happens huh crazy because it s like who do you think made this picture it s like I know and I was like poor James at least Laughter okay I mean he has fought his way to the top he has fought his way to get the budgets that he gets from him I think he s been at the top for like going on years it s not like somebody created that reality for him no so I just don t like I don t I can t A A on somebody that successful because it wasn t handed oh no I love you can see he s like um he s like so deeply involved I mean Avatar took how many years to make yeah so I just think I don t know you know I love James Cameron okay all right I m glad we re on the same page I love him Justice for the cinematographer of top gun Maverick Claudia Miranda and I loved that movie yes I mean he s already got an Oscar I m surprised those are like some non oscory Oscar nominations right because normally I m like snore there s no long and draining and emotionally taxes you haven t seen the Banshee version or not I haven t even heard of him I tried to watch it the other night I was like you re gon na have to put some subtitles on this for me and then I was like you know what I m gon na have to put myself to bed it s a it s a slow one it s a slow burn great cast Slow Burn um I did find the boy who was nominated for best supporting to be in interesting and engaging in the role I think Colin did a beautiful job and I don t give a flying A A about that movie you know okay this is derailing a lot but you know that movie with Jennifer Coolidge and JLo shotgun wedding Jennifer Coolidge isn t it yes what yeah I haven t did she really yes she is why do you think that I know that how do you know what did you think those tick tocks that you brought to my attention were promoting oh I didn t know they were promoting something that was the whole bit of The Tick Tock bro was it yes okay and so it s just funny to me because JLo s doing like the press for the movie and it s clear that they had filmed this before Jennifer Coolidge like after her moment and I think JLo had just kind of like disregarded her and not like disregarded her but she s like on this press store and she s talking to one of the late night hosts and they re like what was it like to be with Jennifer Coolidge and jayla s like well yeah at the time I didn t know like where she started and began and ended and I just uh like like as a Galaxy I didn t know that it was funny so I wish I would have laughed in real time because now I look back and she s so funny in the movie and to me it s clear like she wasn t like aware of Jennifer Coolidge and now like Jennifer Coolidge is getting as much attention as JLo yeah that s starring in the movie because she s having such a moment jayla s like yeah she s really on fire right now and I was like oh um I think jayla s going through some rough stuff I ve got some speculations um this is the movie that was supposed to Star Army Hammer yeah um but also it looked like she was struggling with Ben Affleck at the party what party the party for the movie is oh I didn t see this yeah there was some stuff going viral some private video that was taken and probably shouldn t have been taken at a private party but it was released and it looked like she was like checking his drink to make sure there wasn t alcohol in it and she was like he s like I haven t been drinking Jen God bless Jennifer Lopez yeah I just I feel like her personal life has probably been because her ex husband just married a year old who s her ex husband Marc Anthony yeah and his kids didn t go to the wedding I bet her personal life is so complicated being that famous with that much money where everybody has something to gain from you it s just it s too much I can t imagine it and I really do wish the best for her and she of course she doesn t know who Jennifer Coolidge is she s busy dealing with her A A ex husband baby daddy s year old wife right we ll let it slide yeah I just think it s another funny moment for Jennifer Coolidge and Hollywood and life in general like you never know where anyone s gon na be you got ta be at the top and on the bottom the next day on the bottom and on the top next day it s just a wild ride okay so what was the story about the Oscars oh I mean we have um in it is it worth it no this camera goes forever baby no he literally was going like this I ll just stay until an hour oh oh God I was like Chris you told me this camera goes first yeah that s what I was like too I was like well so much for not cutting a lot of people are always like when are we gon na be able to not cut well apparently here here s that cut also I have to pee so I think cutting s fine I but can t you just give me the gist of the story you put yeah okay before I was like why would I Rush this in two seconds because none of us actually give a flying A A oh so this is actually interesting because we don t really give a flying A A okay but um we don t like where are we gon na watch are you gon na watch I mean I ll probably watch the opening monologue and scroll through and if there s an actor talking I like that s what I do yeah if I can find it I ll scroll and I ll like oh there s Jennifer Coolidge I ll hit play yeah but I spend like minutes total watching these shows same So what had happened was they announced the nominees and on the list of Best Supporting Actresses is a woman who I don t know her name I don t know what movie she s in but apparently she did great work and she was nominated for an oscar but the difference is because remember that one year you were like watch this thing was it Nathan for you about how the Academy Award actually works and like all the money that they put into campaigning and like oh that was Adam Kong it doesn t matter who it was it s the sentiment of the film that I love the piece that I m talking about so it s they it s it s a very political thing a lot of money goes into campaigning I actually recently learned that there are companies that their sole A A purpose is to campaign for Academy all these agencies are hosting luncheons with all of the people on the board yeah to try to they do everything and these agencies employ hundreds of people and the Agents also have huge stake in it because they re on a base salary but they get huge bonuses based on their clients performance and then if you get one of your clients an Oscar Nom or an Oscar whim or win then everyone s calling the next year and then you have an A list client and your bonus is going to be out of this world yeah so everyone has has money in the pot yeah and it s like the biggest company the biggest budget for the campaign wins and so this woman who was nominated for best actress is an upset she people the academy is launching an investigation into social media promotion because while they were voting for the nominees a bunch of people in the academy like Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the names and a few other like big wigs actors wise pushed for this woman to be nominated and they re not spending money on it like that s just a Grassroots Guerrilla social media campaign for a person who they saw doing excellent work right and the academy is like we need to look into this like that s how A A that is and it s like every year I feel like the curtain gets pulled back a little bit more and it s like I used to really look up to the Academy Awards as a little girl like some of my earliest memories are staying up all night to watch the Oscars being so excited to see the performances being super excited to know who s hosting it even though a majority of my youth it was Billy Crystal like all of these things I used to Aspire to be a member of the academy because it A A meant something and I feel like each year I m like oh this means nothing yeah because you start seeing the inner workings of how everything is conducted yeah it s contrived it s political it s Financial none of it is like a sincere expression of anything and like I I mean I don t know it feels like it s been a long time since Hollywood meant something as is almost everything because when money is involved when I mean it like I think a lot of things do start with good intentions but then to keep something afloat or to push it forward or to make it bigger there s all these decisions that have to be made and some that might not seem consequential because become very uh fraudulent fraudulent like later down the line yeah it also just feels like everything s so heavily saturated it used to be really A A hard to make a movie making a movie on film was really A A hard making a picture that made sense and like all together the amount of people and passion and love that went into making a piece of work mattered and now cameras are accessible iPhones are accessible everybody can shoot whatever the A A they want and put it onto Tick Tock and it A A excels movies aren t in theaters anymore they re straight to streaming nobody gives a A A about the experience it s just let s pump and dump pump and dump and it s like as a person who would love to make something that s like garbage and be part of the pump and dump cycle I m also like oh this is a little devastating yeah yeah it s like we re losing the actual culture and passion and love of the artistic storytelling every every Hallmark Christmas movie is exactly the same and we don t care we keep consuming it it s interesting it s like it s an interesting dark thing and like it s equal everyone s equal parts of the problem like yes they keep making them but it s because us as consumers keep watching that yeah if we stopped watching them they d stop being made and there s so many streaming platforms because everyone has an appetite to consume everything it s like we want that quick fix yeah so like you see how it comes to be and they re it s hard to find a solution I mean it feels a little bit like we re chewing our food and then spitting it into a bucket instead of using it to nourish our bodies and it s like kind of sad because now I was actually thinking about movies the other day as like tantamount to reading a book but it s like whoa bro no there was a point in time where movies were like mushing your brain and now watching a movie is better for my brain than spending two hours on tick tock wow wow yeah take that in and that s the set yeah no uh thank you guys so much for watching and enjoying our show we will be back next week we love you so much and we ll see you later and that s this is it Music foreign Music
Music thank you Music really should have put some cover up under my eyes all right one take one I don t know about you guys but I m starting to feel really uncomfortable in my space what do you mean you ve been trying to sleep with me all afternoon oh my God you re a gaslighting maniac are you getting here right now I will leak the text messages I ve called the police five times no yes there s no texts there are texts what are you doing well this is starting to bother me you re right I m too dressed up yeah Ryland Adams has been trying to forcefully make a baby with me oh police all day Lizzy at lunch asked me what let me see if we re like lit and framed okay oh it s lit baby oh no it s frozen oh no wake up wake up why isn t it moving because you have bad internet here no I don t yeah yeah oh now this is about my internet too listen we need to introduce the show because you ve gone way off the rails hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Sip I m Ryland Adams the most fabulous of course joined by Lizzie Gordon who s okay hello hello and welcome to the show we just had a lovely A A lunch date together until we got home what happened when we got home I don t even know what you re talking about you re demanding toilet paper okay that s crazy first of all first of all if anyone has beef it s me I wasn t allowed to sleep in the guest bed though what listen we ve hashed this out and you know the reason because Jared s gon na sleep in it no because we don t want you to ruin the sheets for Jared I get here bed s not even made Shane s friend slept in it Laughter there s no toilet paper what s going on I know my dress is unpressed and then you tried to sleep with me no I m lit I m going to leak the deck no you re not yeah and don t threaten me I will proof is in the pudding yeah and I have the pudding no we were just talking at lunch because Lizzy asked for a baby update yes and I had said hmm because there s there s a lot to the process and once you finish the process you have to go through legal because you have to make sure that the child is legally yours right once whatever and so like we ve finished legal with the donor but I hadn t seen when IBS IVF was starting and then I thought well I recently did talk to somebody who talked about um their parents having um sleep you know like two women two women wanted a baby so they slept one of them slept with a man to impregnore yourself while the other woman was there as well it was strictly to get pregnant yeah it wasn t anything else it s just like like the whole process that we re doing is a lot like it s a lot of steps there s a lot like even the health checks are three months long it s like everything in the world so then I just thought why don t we just get you pregnant Lizzy yeah it s just not Shane will walk that s definitely not happening Joe can be involved no none of us want to be involved be involved she used to want to sleep with me yeah well that was before you denied me for a decade and here we are wow yeah what have you had my baby back then probably probably no probably not I don t even know if I m having my own babies what yes you are I m not bro I m not gon na like I don t know if I m birthing them oh you might explore a surrogate yourself if I get super rich in the next minutes okay I think it s controversial for like uh whatever who cares is it I don t know yeah I like people get mad when celebrities have babies be a surrogate if there isn t a underlying health reason is this like people getting mad at me for getting my dog from a breeder yeah did that statement get me canceled I don t know okay I don t look far into those kinds of things scared I don t think we should talk about it you just brought it up again well that s the thing you ve got to keep in mind I have been up since A A five ten oh so let her say horrible thing I m not saying that was horrible but this doesn t excuse the whole podcast if you say horrible things that s true I guess that s true so you have a lot of things going on first of all I think we should bring an update to last week s episode okay so last week when I discussed my disgust disgusted when you were disgusted when I disgusted the human race and everybody lost hope in me what oh when you disgusted the human race and everyone lost helping me okay disgusted so when I fainted at lunch with that girl and I was super caffeinated I forgot to mention that after that lunch I emailed everybody I ve ever met because you re trying to get jobs she s desperately yeah and I m saying desperately lovingly no because I don t think the sadness came across cross in the podcast as it did at lunch afterwards when you were at the brink of Tears which no I m not laughing because I m just I ve been just as desperate listen nothing has really worked for me either outside of self creation like all of this is self producing self putting on self promoting it s like nobody ever wants to hire me for the job so that s not true like I ve had jobs like I ve been hired for jobs I can t relate I mean I had clever but even there I got no I m talking about educational TV and it s like the boss is my husband okay foreign but I m good at it God damn it um anyways after that I spiraled and emailed million people but I was so caffeinated that like I was accidentally emailing people that weren t the people I was trying to reach and I was trying to reach a woman whose name is we ll say Stephanie but I I in my mind I rewrote that her name was Claire so I emailed a woman named Claire who was not who I was trying to email but it s so A A specific that it s like hella weird that I would send the email so the first thing I said to her was hi Claire I hope you had the best vacate at the music festival I loved the looks on Insta I wanted to follow up with you about what we had talked about previously and I was just like give me give me give me you know what I mean and then I finally like five minutes after I hit send on the email realized oh I didn t mean to send questions to follow up I meant to email Stephanie because it s always the the conundrum is do I follow it up and say like I m sorry and be desperate in the second email I was so caffeinated Laughter um hi Claire I m sorry this is for a different clear but I m kind of glad I accidentally pinged you it s been too long I hope you re doing well and I would love to catch up with you want to get coffee so the whole email wasn t for her the whole email wasn t for her but she emailed me back this is the one email you got back this is the one email I got back I sent like last week I ve heard from one of them and it was the one that you didn t intend but it s technically the best one I enjoy this woman a lot come here right right um yeah give me the other follow up was you wanting me to say the correction for my cover letter where I say followers oh yeah my friend was like a friend that called you out on it like my friend who pointed at highlighting the mistake yeah he said maybe people will think you re being Darkly funny not the case especially with podcasts and they don t know podcast where the podcasting everyone has a podcast and he s like I have a podcast I m a big deal I have a podcast that s what I m always qualifying or following anyways Lizzy got a haircut finally Simon says we sat down to lunch well I wasn t looking at you head on looking at you from the side like this it wasn t as soon as she sat directly in front of me I go oh my gosh you didn t talk about your new haircut on the podcast and she immediately like she had been holding it in for a month because you didn t talk about my new hair on the bike I m going through some things I m an emotional young woman is it my responsibility to acknowledge your haircut yes I think sometimes it s imperative that those who are surrounded by others do unto themselves as they would unto their you didn t mention my haircut did you get a haircut yes I was literally staring at you saying it s hard to take in what you re saying because you re so handsome you did say that and I said your hair looks great I didn t know it was cut but it s like you keep it trimmed you know it s not like a noticeable she s if it was Shaggy it d be like you re a mess but it s like your standard is a trim I m just shocked because like you would normally scream these things from the rooftop you kept your hair chop a secret I do feel like I texted you about it but you texted me but I feel like you haven t gone worldwide no I haven t told anyone about it worldwide I m a busy girl and because it was a pretty big chop yeah I cut all of it off so underwhelming do you not like it no I like it a lot I went to my favorite girl Margie okay Marge Morgan goes to her too really well she went one time okay yeah all right yeah um well do you want to get sad gets uh Rylan we ve been sad Where Have You Been silly um yeah I ve decided I m gon na clean up my house and get my life together stop sleeping on the couch sleep in my bedroom again reclaim my space are you sleeping on the couch yes you are yeah I m that wasn t a look of disdain it was a look of confusion because Joe stays up later than what the it s a fly I know what does he think he can do in here well he s definitely not getting paid for this video yeah not today what is this the A A presidential debates see what I did there you see it s a timely joke because we re a timely podcast oh my God this is so weird come here Riley come eat the fly oh here she wow she listens she s a good girl she really like she s sprang up she said okay Papa here it comes she s smarter than everything no now she s just digging under the couch okay well well can t be can t all be winners okay so you said you were dealing with grief months later oh yeah I m so I m violently sad and I miss jelly every single day uh and it doesn t seem to be getting less sad um and I don t like want to be in my room so I ve been sleeping in the living room did she move the frame so smart oh my gosh you re gon na unplug the road tester come here come here that Riley is so smart right now we re trying to be sad right now Riley Bradley read the Ruby your dad s hyper caffeinated and he s trying to act as if he cares what anyone else is saying don t ruin this for him Riley she s Riley I m sympathetic this is empathetic no no no I really do care this isn t the podcast where you re the victim no it s a different podcast yeah if you want me to be the victim go to Shades podcast he s the villain here this is Vibes right now I m sorry maybe we should come back to something serious I mean I don t really have an update on it because like it s mostly I talk about things like this on the podcast or on my Vlog because it makes me do something positive for myself it s like an accountability moment right so you know the hope is now that I ve said it here I will follow through on it wait you aren t cleaning up your room no my room I mean I will now that I ve said it here in front of all of you we should do that as a part of your Vlog well I was going to this week and then A A just got too crazy because cleaning montages are very satisfying are you really yeah I personally enjoy that I don t even know how to go about shooting a cleaning Montage you put it up on a wide angle yeah of your room yeah and you hit record while you clean for a long time and then you time lapse it wow that seems like a lot and what you could do is what you re learning but you would make it into like seconds you would speed it up it s a time it s like a hmm and then you could even do a vo about like what you ve learned while you re cleaning up your room dealing with grief and then how you feel afterwards oh yeah oh well first producer here s the other thing I was thinking you could come to my house and you could do my grief cleaning for me I don t know about cleaning I could help you design if you wanted well the thing is we moved the massage chair into my office so I do need a new vibe in there okay and I want disco balls to be part of it maybe when I m there once once we re in back oh my Riley this is serious Riley we re scheduling things Riley hey come here oh my gosh hi Riley oh she s looking at me hi girls and so you are avoiding your room though because of yeah I don t I spent so much time with jelly in there and making the bed jelly always like to be in the bed while I made it and then she d A A it up and it was like our thing or I d make her into it like in the pillows and then she d just be in there and it just it feels weird you know what I mean and I don t want it to not feel if the oh the thing that I wanted to touch upon with the grief thing is like it feels bad to move on right it feels bad to not be sad and anytime I m hot happy I get like triggered into sadness again and then like randomly I ll just be driving and I ll just start scream crying but the thing is like I m also still you know I m still doing life like I m still working I m still you know going to the gym going to my meetings like talking to friends like not isolating or doing something that s like scary health wise except for letting my house become a mess right and it s like not that messy it s like messy if I had three kids messy and I have four I have four growing boys two dogs two boys got it yeah um but yeah I kind of just I want to be able to be in my I don t like I don t wan na to get to my desk in my office I don t want to have to go over five luggage suitcases that are half unpacked and like I want to fold my laundry and put it away I should probably do a deep clean of mine this is boring you deserve to do all of that I deserve you deserve to not feel I know it hits at I mean you can t plan when grief hits no but you should clean your space especially your room and maybe do something to it so that it feels refreshed in a way that isn t forgetful but makes you not so you re probably just getting in bed sheets yeah that s what I mean something new yeah not to forget the old yeah but I m sorry it s a bummer because it s like I don t know man I just miss her so bad she s everything if she was an A A this wouldn t be so hard bubs is an A A and it will be equally as hard Bob this is my sweet little lover boy this is my baby master and I A A worship that little A A and you know who s so sweet what the baby is a sweetie icky yeah icky s the sweetest little bean like all he wants to do is just love I call him a Relentless lover but like a consensual Relentless lover me no I ll leak the Ducks I can t even read that furniture Karen oh no do you really want to do that to you well I don t know I just thought like I don t have many other stories this week oh no what did you do this week though and a lot of people the last time I told my furniture story they were like you re awful and I was like that s the point I was telling you that I was acting like a A A Karen so what and sometimes like we had a hard week and I just well I was your week hard well I mean you know why my week was hard and it doesn t feel right to follow it up right after what a year ago why was your record I can t remember honey oh yeah sorry yeah we had like uh that s fair but and I don t want to like um we can move on if you want to edit that part out no it s fine I mean I don t want to it s more so like I don t want to be like your situation and then my situation right you know I mean we can talk about it after the podcast but I never feel that way I never ever feel that way right because you can compartmentalize the two things just because something happened to me doesn t mean that something happening to you isn t something I can support you in right well we so honey had and I talked about it on the podcast before because she was a conehead because I was walking her one day and I looked down and I saw a mass and I was just like oh we need to get it checked out and even when we got it checked out the vet was like oh I always have like three checkpoints like is it growing rapidly how long has it been there is it hard and it was none of the things that seemed to be dangerous and Riley Riley this Vision hurt timing ran get your toy girl and Shane and I just ultimately decided better safe than sorry yeah um for some reason they thought where it was located she didn t want to do the fine needle aspirate and I didn t know much about it because I ve never experienced it before I mean looking there s I m not a doctor so we got it removed can I just make a quick PSA for anyone else yes you can anybody else if you find a mask on your dog and there is any sort of question of whether or not it is a mast cell tumor always do the fine needle asper at first because it matters if they re going to do an operation to remove it they re going to need to take a huge Mark or not a huge margin but a margin around the mast cell tumor to ensure that they don t like upset it because if you upset a mast cell tumor it can become inflamed and sort of spread like blowing on a dandelion sorry rightly it was about to unplug this whole setup and I know nothing about masses or mast cell tumors uh like this is our first time ever experiencing it and honestly it just looked like nothing nothing and so I trusted and you re not a doctor why would you notice that s why you take your dog to the vet really looking into it and knowing what I know now sorry I m out of breath now because I was doing dealing with Riley he really just did the most that was like parkour all A A core strength she was entangled in the plug for what we re recording on and had that gone badly we would have lost it all she looks so guilty she is Riley just lay down it s time to take a nap anyways they sent it off and it turns out that it was a mast cell tumor so that means that it s cancer for dogs and it s for what it is its best case scenario because it is only isolated right now to that one place we ve got her an ultrasound we got her whole body checked they did everything they could to see what was going on with her and it seems right now that it is just that one spot and the more and more research we did when we went to the cancer doctor they were saying that all is well right now the only problem is because they didn t do the fine needle aspirate they didn t know what it was to what extent so she got surgery but the bad news is all of it wasn t removed when they removed it because they didn t know what they were looking at or for and so now she s gon na have to go back into surgery again which is just now she s gon na have I mean it seemed we like I don t want to complain about any of it because like it s a it s great news yeah it s just a bummer that she s gon na have to go through it again and then be a conehead again and recover again but I mean best case scenario for something so bad and it was a whole week of just I mean not knowing what was going on calling a million doctors because nobody can get you in anywhere right now because everyone s overwhelmed and understaffed and you know overbooked so it was just oh it was a lot but um thankfully she s gon na be okay why did I get onto this what were we doing I was talking about Jolly no I know but oh you had a bad week and I questioned it like an A A because I was gon na be like is it was it about a week I m the A A and we don t even have to ask Reddit no you re not and I yeah yes um oh so yes I was a little on it okay that s fair so you re on edge and you have every right to be Anna what did you do taking it out on this furniture salesman okay so we had ordered a table from Crate and Barrel and when you order things from Crate and Barrel that the switch up in your energy right now is manic

or UPS you have to pay a large delivery fee which is normally to just says I know and it s because they have a delivery service that they hire out I ve ordered a lot of stuff from them in the past and it s always been a great service they come they put it in the room they assemble it they take everything away and so they give me a time frame and they re like we ll be there from to a two and I was like great I had my whole morning planned I went and I worked out and right when I m walking into my workout class they re calling me they re like we re gon na be here in minutes I was like I ll be home at it s the earliest I can do I m so sorry but like I had a time frame yeah it is what it is yeah and I know their day is probably jam packed and hard too so if they could fit me in I m sorry but I wasn t home we love an understanding King and then what happened when did he lose his understanding the bank to get them money I got out sixty dollars to tip them graciously because I know it s a hard job it s like it s a lot of manual labor it s hot outside and I like to to tip people well when they re doing a service such as that but then I m at the bank at the ATM and Shane s calling me and he s like they just dropped it off in boxes and left and I m like oh you just let them go and he was like well what s he says give me an option I just told them like it s gon na be in the barn and then when I came back out they were done and I was like you re kidding me and there s like a lot of stuff so I get home and it is it s just all in boxes there s a ton of huge boxes my recycling doesn t come for another two weeks even if I break it down it s not gon na fit in my recycling yeah so I m just kind of pissed off because you pay a fee for this and you didn t even get it it got the stuff dropped off and that s it that then I m calling Crate and Barrel because you know what I was just like I was I I was at the end of my my line here and I was just like it should be it just should be honestly you paid for it and you re picking up money to give them more money and then they let them out there s more money and if they would have just done the job yeah it would have been all okay so I m out here I m texting them they didn t answer their phone so then I get online to chat with them I m chatting with them and I m like telling them the situation and the guy that was helping me was like no I don t know and I was like well you either need to refund my delivery fee yeah or you need to have the guys come back out and at least pick up the boxes like I ll build the furniture but at least pick up the boxes because then I m gon na have to figure out how I can find a dump yeah our house is a nightmare of boxes Joe oh I can t say it online why because I don t think it s legal what we ve been doing with our boxes foreign ladies and gentlemen and so finally a manager gets on there and she s like I m so sorry I took off the delivery fee for you good I was like that s very nice and then I was just like pushing my luck because if you don t ask for it you don t get it and I was like what am I supposed to do with all these boxes because I don t have I don t have my recycling for another I don t have recycling for another week and a half and she was like I can have them out there in days and I was like I mean that doesn t work and I go what can the guys that just dropped it off at least Circle back if they re still in the area and pick up the boxes yeah which like then I m gon na have to confront them which is also awkward but she s like I ll contact the dispatch and have them contact you so the dispatch contacts me and he s like I hear there s a problem and I was like well yeah I ve every time I ve ordered from Crate and Barrel they ll always assemble it take down the boxes it s a great service and they just dropped the boxes and he goes well somebody signed for it and I was like that somebody wasn t the Somebody That was supposed to do it and they didn t know how to what they were asking for or what was the take advantage of a husband who you nothing an innocent vulnerable husband and quite honestly Shane s never even awake at that time so it was a miracle he was awake and I knew that if I called him when they had called me that he wasn t going to answer his phone because he was on vibrate and he was asleep so I don t even know how all of that went down and I was like well yeah but that was somebody that didn t know that there was a delivery and he just signed because they gave him a paper to sign yeah and he goes well I don t see the problem and I go well isn t building a part of the service and he goes well yeah and I was like well then why didn t you guys build the furniture and he was like well I don t know and I was like okay so are they gon na come pick up the box I know I m being a A A Karen no but that s not being a Karen that s like that s honest that s that s a real question well then if you just agreed that that is part of your job then why did you not complete your job and then he s like okay I ll send them back out to pick up the boxes because I had already built the furniture and I was like okay great thank you so I went in the shed and I pulled out all the boxes and put them there they picked them up and left and didn t even ring the doorbell or talk to me but I m like now you had to come back twice yeah you didn t get the tip yeah because you didn t even ring the doorbell when you came back and it s like it s fine but I was just see you re who I want to get my nails done with because you would have not might like my friend my friend Shannon she s great when they ve blew off her toenail appointment she was like not happy about it and she was like so I m just gon na cancel my nails and they were like oh she s like yeah I ve been here for an hour my friend s nails are done I m not gon na sit here by myself all like when we made an appointment oh yeah the problem is it s A A with your time too like I also scheduled my day around this like I did have a lot going on and I also scheduled my day around it so it just whatever foreign I m thinking about getting a tattoo how many do you have in total that s a great question I have one two three four five whoa yeah they re hitting six do you have any visibility yeah six yeah okay where one oh yeah that one was a mistake no I love that one you do that s why I know Joe the Lark he was a he was a victim he was not a victim he was a victim no he was not he wanted to produce sketch comedy like visual sketch comedy based around it with Nicole and I oh yeah okay and did he hit up you or Nicole first uh Nicole okay it was through James all right yeah okay and that s when I found Joe and I said he will be mine and where s the new placement of this tattoo I was thinking it would be like on my ankle like like my shark in the wave thing or it could be here what s your shark in the wave represent it was a Friday the th tattoo that I paid very little money for I would I always wanted a Friday the th tattoo oh just because it s here it s a picture of icky drinking out of the toilet which when my dog went to do that she acted like I was an abusive parent well he s trying to he can t reach the bowl so if you reached the ball you would run in and stop him yeah stop it well do you have nasty shits in the toilet stop it do you not flush I d say don t eat my nasty shits from the toilet Icarus I m sorry if this episode is unhinged like I was you re A A like lubricated with caffeine right now I know and I feel like it has masked everything I think I really appreciate you taking accountability for your part in this I did not give you the correct um response to your drama because Riley was being a nightmare so here s one oh that s really cute wait did somebody draft those up for you well those aren t my dogs did oh my God I thought they were no but it s super cute right and I would do it I would I did okay I would do icky bubs and jelly so that s option A and option b is this where it looks like they re looking oh that s really cool and that s what I would do on my account so they re gon na be homage to your dogs well they re gon na be my dogs right yeah I m gon na have James put them into Photoshop so if you is James gon na draw them um no the tattoo artist will okay but James has a really great tattoo artist who does dogs really lifelike wow I think I like option two but they re both very cute they re both you can t go wrong and they d be very small really small oh I don t know if do you think people are gon na get sick of us talking about airports so often well this was different this was this today the airport hit different okay it felt like everybody who s on like who s retired decided to leave today for a vacation and I m not even kidding well all the kids are back in school so maybe they think they re not gon na have to deal with all the little A A I mean I guess but it was wild there were a lot of over year old people in massive groups going places and there is there s like um like an inherent Panic within them and I don t know what it is you know what I mean like but there was like at every at every turn like I thought I had missed my flight I thought I like I thought my plane was boarding and when I got to Burbank this morning and it s like everybody s getting on the plane I missed the opportunity like all this it seemed like the energy was that of the plane is taking off on the tarmac they hadn t even started boarding the plane yet there were just hordes of A A retirees being like we got ta stand by there it s like they didn t even started boarding a group and people who were in C group were like we should get up there literally they said that out loud like they made an announcement we are now boarding all the a groups and I saw five people turn to each other go we re C group we should get ready now like I was like oh should I get ready as a b group member if two group members are and then they start panicking pushing towards it and then the same thing when we get on the plane everybody s a maniac about getting all the points like girl we re on Southwest you think so these people are gon na come hang out at their vacation in Denver it seems like it it was it was weird it s a weird vibe and then like we re sitting on the plane it s like I have this Vibe of like who A A cares you know what I mean like because who A A cares about where you re sitting on a Southwest flight okay you can t control it it s pure A A nightmare yeah people are on the phone with their loved ones I m gon na get the worst A A seat on this plant like literally I m not kidding it was like Titanic what they were talking about on the phone with their loved ones like it was gnarly one woman was like I m gon na get the worst seat she s on the phone another girl s like you and me both it s like so you re both like all the seats suck after you re sitting it doesn t matter to me no it doesn t matter at all it it sucks to get to like if you re all the way in the back it just sucks to get there but once you re in the back it doesn t really matter no who A A cares it was wild and then when it came to when it came to get off time everyone s jumping out of their seats and it s like where it s like it s like that on every plane though like everybody for some reason is like let s jump the A A up for nothing right now and it s just like all right this time the two women next to me were like we re up and we re out and I was like in the middle because I had been you know I had the worst seat in the building and like I had to jump up with them and no part of me enjoyed that but it felt like they were like looping their arms around my arms like get up A A do you ever talk to the people next time hard pass on that I will not be talking to anybody on a A A plane what like I don t understand the point of that it s like you re a A A stranger I m a A A stranger what are we doing here what if they came up to you and were like I love the zip oh I would probably be a little bit embarrassed and also love it that would have like I was like black app like oh my God you mean the Sip with Ryland Adams and Lizzie Gordon they go yeah I d be like wow dude thanks man uh do you thanks uh oof that s what it would be like I would panic but I d also love it okay yeah okay I might paint from it so be careful make sure I m seated if you re gon na recognize me but like still recognize me you know just do it loud from afar oh that was the other thing I like the whole airplane no and then there all the other people around will say huh I ve never heard of her why do you want to talk to her I dropped dead of embarrassment that s the other thing though like you know what I was like and it s not that this is also bad for look for me but I would love to weaponize the recognition you know what I m saying what do you mean like remember that one time we were recognized when we went out to lunch and then like five seconds later we saw someone I knew and I was like oh why couldn t if this have happened in front of them right it never happened no I m really I m bored you know I m not bored of you I m just like so tired yeah I got it I got it me too I m tired of me too but like I said last week can t escape me I m everywhere I go sad we could take a little power nap after this I m really gunning to watch the Lindsay Lohan trailer for her Christmas I mean it s only three minutes and seconds so you don t need something I m looking forward to crazy all right but yeah the mob mentality airport was A A wild today all right let s get into some advice though wow we were like harmonized should we try it again oh no oh I was just gon na sing oh no you know you did it was it beautiful I mean did we remember tonight we ve lost everyone but you and I are entertained I need to do some of that colon broom after this hi Rylan and Lizzy oh she has the cord and the bone in her mouth hey Riley stop doing the cord thank you she did it she s a good listener that girl why is she like this thing oh man look what I m trying you know what s trippy can you see how in depth the iPhone zoomed in is like the way that I could see everything it s like a microscope right but you know I was trying to film Riley and not the A A mess but have you ever done that like last time we flew on a plane Shane was trying to just get out the window but it got like the craziest inside of his hair follicles and it s like offensive how how microscopic it is yeah don t move that s disgusting what s in there you got freckles and like you need to moisturize bro hey Rylan and Lizzy girl thank you sending this for the advice segment on the pod great choice I can t help but seek validation from others for example I went out the other night and my friends and I knew from within that I looked good wait I read that wrong I went off the other night with my friends and I knew from within that I looked good but because I m not laughing at her I m laughing at your your interpretation of that I know I m sorry but because no one flirted with me or told me that I looked hot I went home feeling ugly ugh I hate that feeling I know that I m beautiful and I am enough but for some reason I can t help it I keep wanting waiting for validation of other people in order to feel good and confident about myself how can I put an end to all of this love you guys I mean I get it do you yeah I mean I never got hit on as much as I thought I should have been when I was going to the bars when I was yeah you know and it sucks if you re like oh I got a good outfit or are you gon na lose another tooth Riley yeah I m you should grab that from her I m so sorry this whole podcast not to you to

think you ve come back into your body some a little bit yeah yeah if you re feeling the caffeine remorse this is why I quit coffee really yeah well this shame spiral see and this is the thing I have a very controlled amount of caffeine every single day like I have one cup right when I wake up and I have one cup at like four hours later and that is how I do caffeine and today we went through Starbucks and I was like I ll get a grande iced latte and then I even said to you I said how many shots is in a grande yeah because like if it s two I ll be unhinged well it must be two it must be two and I fear I should have just gotten a tall so I want to apologize to you I think it s okay but like I do feel as though I wasn t present to be sincere when you were talking about what s been going on with you right but if we were any more sincere I d have been crying and you don t pay me enough for that to happen on the podcast and I yes my and the honey thing I had already like processed yes I m processing and I just don t know if I want to bring the full game I d like I would that s not something like we vlogged or anything obviously because it s just too too much it s too raw and yeah and it s too stressful yeah yeah I get it I m sorry to you and I m sorry to you I mean you re sweet for apologizing I didn t feel it was necessary but I mean they might feel it will be necessary I ll never apologize I ll never know and tell because things look like how I feel I was acting was crazy yeah uh I think you were great we ll see how it came across I think you were great okay oh no deletes all the footage and says we need a virtual episode I will set your house on fire anyways back to our friend who needs advice do you need do you need to catch up no I remember okay she thought she looked really good yeah she probably did look really good yeah but she has a hard time with confidence and she feels she needs outside validation and did her friends not acknowledge her accordingly no her friends did acknowledge it I just read that part wrong okay the problem is that she needs she and even if her friends do acknowledge it even if another person does flirt with her it s that s a problem in and of itself but you were talking about how you didn t feel like you d been flirted with enough when you were yeah let me be more hateable quite honestly no I do I understand where you re coming from because I think a lot of the fun of going out when you re single or when you re looking is getting dressed up is going out is getting a little out of your comfort zone getting a little drunk and maybe flirting with some people or like you know it s fun to go back and forth like that with somebody and if you don t get any attention like that on you it s a little bit like oh I think you can be let down about it but you got your worth can not come from external sources it s got to come from within yeah I think you should try to separate the confidence and the self worth outside of going out but I still think you re valid in maybe feeling bummed that you didn t have the fun you had hoped for on the night out and she specifically all of this and I struggle with this a lot myself I was actually thinking about that on the drive in because I m a self centered A A like oh I never thought I was pretty in high school and like all this stuff and I think that a big problem of what we do is like it s comparative so I m comparing myself to everybody that I see and I don t look like anybody else because I look like my A A self right and the same is true for all of us so you know stop comparing yourself to other people start finding good within yourself it s the it s the negative self talk and the aggressive self criticism that s unnecessary that I think we got ta stop it s like I m trying to find the right way to explain it because like I have meltdowns all the A A time and Joe can t stand it because I ll be like I m very vulnerable right now because I hate the way I look and when I hate the way I look I feel like A A and he s like well I wish that wasn t the case because number one you don t look like A A right and it should not affect the way that you feel and I and I think that yes that s true but we all feel that way yes because as silly as it is I wear the same v neck t shirt every day because I like the way it looks on me I like how it fits on my arms because like if there s a place I don t love about and it s not even that I don t love it but it s like I m not ripped and I like a shirt to fall a certain way so it s like and if you don t just feel comfortable you re thinking about not feeling comfortable so then you re not able to just live in the moment or be free so then you re thinking about how your confidence or you re thinking about negative self talk and I think even a couple weeks ago when I was talking about how when I m not checking my thoughts regularly I can like get into a like when it s I m not even realizing I m manifesting bad things for myself but I think with the self confidence if you that felt like you looked great and you did look great keep rating radiating that energy because it s going to come back to you you know what I mean and the more positive self talk you have the more positive a time you re going to enjoy so like I found personally for me if I spend less time looking in the mirror and more time like what do I feel sick in like what do I feel dope in God I sound so stupid like what do I feel the coolest in you know what I mean like I love wearing this little suit so it s like I m not going to look in the mirror about it because it s not about how it looks it s about how I feel in it and the more the better I feel the cooler it is because I m I m exuding confidence right and it s like it s you know people are attracted to that it s they re attracted to confidence and does that help the self confidence yeah yeah it does because I m not looking at myself picking myself apart in the mirror I m like oh damn like I feel good today like I feel good I love this two piece set I m wearing like these shoes are my feet like like literally like you see how I came in here today I love how I feel in that outfit you did look great did I you did I felt like I looked like a little like if I m if I m gon na be negative if I was a little kid being picked up from daycare but I feel A A money in it right and that s all that matters because I can walk around comfortably comfortable all day okay so then you re confident and comfortable yourself but then how do you not seek external validation when you re feeling that way I think and going out into the world because you know what I mean they kind of feel separate even though they re linked they re definitely linked I also know the only thing I can control is myself I can not force another person to give me a compliment I can t force another person to you know see me or flirt with me but I can control how I feel in that moment you know what I mean I feel good in this and you know what I m not going to diminish feeling good about myself in this moment because someone else didn t praise it I can t control that result and you shouldn t wait around for somebody else to make something happen for yourself yeah if you saw somebody you liked you could also make a subtle move you don t have to overtly hit on them but maybe you didn t see anyone you were interested in either and it s like maybe that guy I know like traditionally the guys are hitting on the women blah blah blah but maybe the guy wants to feel validated too it wouldn t hurt for a guy to feel like oh this girl really like wants to strike up a conversation with me and if you re feeling confident in yourself and you see something you like I think you should go after look at it why not have a great night just because the person didn t come to you when I saw Joe the first thing I said was he will be mine yeah and now I m married ladies some I think if you see something you like go after it go get it keep looking good keep radiating that energy and I think it will all come full circle for you yes took us a while to get there but here we are dude it s hard it is hard because I think oh God was so ugly and then I look back at my kid pictures I m like God damn it girl you ve been if you could only be yes because you always look back and you re like wow that person looked great that version of me looked great and it s like well we are a version of ourselves that we ll look back at later so we need to tell ourselves we look A A great yeah yeah um okay uh next one all right I don t know if this is Juicy enough for a question but I do have a moral dilemma and I would love some help my father is an addict his source is mainly alcohol cigarettes and marijuana I grew up with this so I have a slight hatred for those things I also realize I am an addict and I know how hard it can be to stop the dichotomy I live in is frustrating my dilemma is that recently my mom has uh needed financial help so of course I helped with food and money but I noticed my dad s still buying beer and cigarettes am I a shitty person because this bothered me also how can I help them without feeling like I am contributing to addiction it would be hard not to build resentment if you re going out of your way to spend your hard earned money on what you re seeing is adding to the demise of your father um I think having an brutally honest conversation with them that I love you I want to help you I know times are tough but I hate that I can see my money represented in something that he struggles with that I also struggle with yeah and that needs to be cut out yeah I I feel that I personally am get uh have started being very irritated when I pay for somebody else s alcohol like I don t like doing it I don t like buying alcohol for my house I don t like buying alcohol for a party I don t like splitting a tab that has booze on it and I don t know why you should it shockingly happens a lot and like you know if you go to a group dinner everyone wants to share a bottle of wine all of a sudden I m paying for a bottle of wine I didn t drink that s also very expensive or like everyone s at dinner everyone gets a drink but me and all of a sudden part of my check is alcohol yeah the drinks yeah and it s uh it s annoying it s definitely annoying um I haven t found I have found that my solution for that is I out loud say I am not drinking so I will not contribute to the alcohol portion of the tap and I ve had other people say the same thing to me like I am not drinking or if like someone s doing a celebratory thing yeah they ll say I m gon na provide the food I will not pay for alcohol yeah so if it s like at a restaurant it s alcohol on a separate tap yeah why would you tempt your like why would you pay for some your VI you know it just doesn t make sense even more than it s not like I m tempted by paying for someone else s alcohol I m just A A annoyed yeah like just don t it s and it s okay to be annoyed by things like that and it s okay to have a boundary about it and say I will not be contributing to the to financing the alcohol how do you successfully though give somebody money and control how they re spending it you don t and that s the problem so when you give somebody something you ve made the choice to no longer be in control of that thing so you have to make peace with the fact that uh knowing full well contributing financially to your parents means they re going to spend it on something that you don t agree with you know I think the solution could be if you re really seeing their needing help or if they re asking for help you can say listen I m happy to help I ll directly go and pay the cable bill or I ll directly go to the grocery store write me a list and I ll get those things I think her problem or their problem I don t know if it s a boy or a girl I think their problem is specifically that no matter what any kind of help is also in support of the items that they re buying to use right because if you re paying for the groceries that leaves extra fun for the dad and no matter what it s not extra fund it s money that they re already spending on those things and they will spend on those things regardless because cause it s a necessity for them or so they think and so but I think the bottom line comes down to you can say I want to help you I don t feel comfortable helping you while you are in active use and I love you and that doesn t change and that is all you have to say I love that I love the sentiment of that but then what about the mom if the mom s not and you want to help the mom but your dad s not willing but it s the same household so you contribute it s just very tricky and I I I think that is the best approach that s seemingly the only approach and it s okay to do that that there s another thing where it s like uh there s a program that you can go to as an individual who s affected by other people s addictions and one of the main things of it is ensuring healthy boundaries for yourself so that you re not acting codependently and you re not doing things that are outside of your comfort that bring a mental and physical and financial burden to yourself to support somebody else s active use right and quite frankly that s the best thing you can do for an addict not financially enable their using when you do that you keep them from experiencing something like a rock bottom that might change that might actually change them using anytime you support financially anytime you lie for them anytime you do anything that enables the active addiction you re keeping them a step further away from a rock bottom that might save their life yeah as hard as yeah as hard as that may be because you can t change someone you can t ask them to be anything but what they are and that moment they can choose to change yeah that s what I ve learned time and time again is you can beg somebody to get help you can present help you can do everything you want but in reality the person isn t going to get help in La until they ve decided yeah well they re good so I guess even with the mom like you might have to if it really if the dad s problems are affecting the entire family you might have to have a conversation with your mom that is the same in which I feel as though this is life threatening to Dad and you and I together are enabling this so because because quite frankly you also don t want to enable an enabler because and that s that is the truth about addiction addiction doesn t just affect me it affects every single person that s attached to me my alcoholism and addiction is gon na A A my husband my father my mother anybody all of those people are trying to do what they feel best because it s never easy if you re really seeing somebody go down the wrong path it s hard to say okay you re so bad right now that you re not going to be able to be in a house you re not going to be able to function as a human and to just be at peace with them being absolutely not okay it s about accepting Life On Life s terms not just as an addict alcoholic but as a person who s related to an addict alcoholic you have to accept that that person is on their own path that you can not change it if they don t want to change it right they need to be in a point of desperation where they finally decide that they re going to surrender and make a change for themselves financially supporting them or anybody that enables them is not going to help yourself it s and it s not you re setting yourself up to be disappointed time and time again Andrew Fanning the fire you want to A A close the jar take all the oxygen away for it and let it burn itself out wow I mean I think your advice is great because even like it s hard who hasn t experienced it I would have been just like like I said initially just pay for the groceries but you re right it s doing the same thing so yeah it s hard though and and that s why it helps to be in a group of people who have the same problem because you you realize you re not alone in what you re doing and there s there is strength in numbers and you can see another person who s already made the hard choice that you re considering making and how it s paid off for them which is really that s that s what I find the most invaluable thing about the Fellowship of the program I identify with is seeing another person who s done what they re telling me to do that I think is impossible in the moment but then I think wait no it s not impossible because that A A did it and if she can do it I can A A do it and that s you know that s the that s the beauty of like having someone go before you into the darkness like you know that at the end of this tunnel there is an answer and it s one that I want so I can trust that even though I m doing something uncomfortable by the end of it I will have a relief yeah prequel prequel stuff next I ve been with my boyfriend for over five years and before me he had only dated girls he told his parents about us two years ago and their reaction was really bad his mom said him dating a guy was the worst thing ever quote they don t let him talk about me when he s visiting them for the holidays they also teaches year old siblings to be homophobic am I a A A for hating them and not wanting them at our future wedding I feel like I m turning him against his family but I also don t want anything to do with them and even if they have a change of heart I don t think I could forgive them for how homophobic they have been Thanks for reading that s heartbreaking it s devastating I I m curious how your boyfriend s interactions with his family are outside of you knowing how they are in regards to your relationship I I mean it sounds like it s been pretty awful to the point where you said even if they get their act together you re not sure that you re willing to have a relationship with them I wonder if you and your boyfriend uh are a example of a healthy relationship over time if it will change some of their opinions because I do think in some spaces even being gay is popularized as main I don t even know as as common as as accepted as it is today there still is if you don t have somebody in your family if you don t know about it it could still just sit with you the wrong way like I had family members when I came out that were like you re not gay or like not homophobic not just not considering not yeah it s never been their Norm they don t know about it so I wonder if trying to endure them a little bit sorry I m dying that anyone ever said you re not gay continue like who said that my brother he was like maybe you ve just been in California too long and he just yeah no he just didn t know but you know what Austin does know about what the quarter system and taxes no and it s nothing against him he didn t know it s just like even I didn t know growing up that I like I didn t figure out that I was gay because it didn t dawn upon me because I didn t have any examples in my life so I think the more popularized the more what did you say accepted oh yeah it because I think the parents will come around it s your choice if you re ever going to forgive them or not I uh I can t speak to any of that but I can say uh forgiveness isn t for the person you re forgiving it s for yourself and harboring a resentment for that like it s like letting them live rent free in your mind let them go dude and especially if they have a change of heart Let It Go if especially if they have a change of heart and if you re feeling some type of way I can only imagine your boyfriend whose family it is is feeling times that so it s of his best interest really to get his family in line and checked out on this situation or they aren t going to be in his life because your boyfriend is going to push him away if they can t accept him for who he is or the life he s choosing to live so I think Lizzie is correct in that you need to let it go because it s not serving you in any way other than driving you out the wall and hurting you it s like having a thorn in your paw and saying no I m gon na A A keep it here take it take the thorn out of your paw what they do is not your A A concern you focus on your relationship with the guy that you love if you re so serious that you want to get married to him focus on that relationship with him if he s not going to make a healthy choice that s in support of your relationship that s when you got to reconsider your relationship with him but for the time being remove the thorn that is his parents homophobia from your paw it s you can t change what they re thinking if they do change their minds welcome them with open A A arms and show them how A A wrong and stupid they were for being an A A in the first place by being the sweetest person you can be yeah you never have to forget you never have to forget but you can kill him with kindness you know what I m saying no I agree and this is like I m kind of stopped in my tracks because I don t know I don t know how I would react to this I d be A A pissed I would be livid and I think my first stop would be really talking with my boyfriend about this yeah and letting him lead the charge because it is his family and I m if if the parents hate me already I m already one foot out of the situation so I m not engaging with them unless I have to if they re being rude to me that s a whole other thing yeah but I just think if you can kill them with kindness when you have to endure them yeah show them that you re bigger than that yeah also you don t have to I m not I m not saying be a martyr or a punching bag for these people or homophobia I am saying relieve yourself of the burden of them mentally don t let them take up your mental space like that with anything you re dealing with honestly that s out of your control I do think thinking about it is only yeah it s just it s just awful a psycho thing that I ve learned and picked up that doesn t necessarily make sense when I say it the first time but if you try it it works if you pray for the person that you don t like to have what you want eventually you re relieved of the burden of that hatred no that makes sense like if uh and and so like one of my favorite things to do is like God help the son of a A A who crosses me because I m gon na be praying for his ass foreign yeah yeah but it helps I m sorry yeah it s pretty stupid it s A A awful yeah you could also you know what you re gon na A A up their property or something and do it really quietly so they think it s one of the young son s friends TP their house egg them blame it on the homophobic kids I have questions for the boyfriend you do do you want to call him yeah let s call him I would like to honestly if you want to call us we re here for you next episode oh yeah all of you as a matter of fact yeah we do have a number it s listed in our um description section below you can leave a voicemail and if you want us to call you back leave your number as well and we can do that on the show um and I hope we helped the last one really stumped me I don t think I ve ever been so stumped oh it s because it s really A A devastating and the only answer is to be Mother Teresa about it is it still is Mother Teresa taboo I don t know I feel like Mother Teresa was recently canceled really yeah no one s safe hmm all right well with that we re gon na go watch Lindsay Lohan s Christmas movie trailer
